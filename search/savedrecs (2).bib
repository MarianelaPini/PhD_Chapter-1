Abstract = {The evaluation of the process of plant succession in degraded places is
   an important tool to define recovery strategies. Thus, considering the
   current situation of degradation in forest ecosystems, the present study
   aimed to study the dynamics of the floristic composition of the
   colonizing vegetation, in three degraded areas in the process of natural
   regeneration, in the Serra do Espinhaco Meridional. In the first
   inventory, all tree-shrub individuals with DAS30 >= 3 cm were sampled.
   In the second inventory, dead individuals were recorded, survivors were
   remeasured and recruited individuals were measured and identified (DAS30
   >= 3 cm). The dynamics rates were calculated: mortality, recruitment,
   gain and loss in the basal area and number of individuals for each area.
   The H `values obtained for the areas were compared in pairs by the
   Hutcheson t test. The pattern observed in the three areas was similar
   and the most significant changes during the two inventories were the
   significant increase in density and the rapid increase in the total
   basal area. All the structural indicators analyzed showed that the areas
   are in the process of initial construction, but the area degraded by
   gold mining is in a more advanced successional stage when compared to
   the area degraded by the vocorocamento process and the area degraded by
   diamond mining.},

Title = {Impacts of large-scale forest restoration on socioeconomic status and

Abstract = {Forests are sources of wood, non-timber forest products and ecosystems
   services and goods that benefit society as a whole, and are especially
   important to rural livelihoods. Forest landscape restoration (FLR) has
   been proposed as a way to counteract deforestation and reconcile the
   production of ecosystem services and goods with conservation and
   development goals. But limited evidence indicates how large-scale forest
   restoration could contribute to improving local livelihoods. Here, we
   present a conceptual framework to analyze the effects of large-scale
   restoration on local livelihoods, and use it to review the scientific
   literature and reduce this knowledge gap. Most of the literature
   referred to case studies (89\%), largely concentrated in China (49\%).
   The main theme explored was income, followed by livelihoods
   diversification, off-farm employment opportunities, poverty reduction,
   equity and the provision of timber and energy as ecosystem services.
   Nearly 60 percent of the papers discussed the importance of governance
   systems to socioeconomic outcomes. The reforestation/restoration
   programs and policies investigated in the studies had mixed
   socioeconomic effects on local livelihoods depending on other variables,
   such as availability of off-farm jobs, household characteristics, land
   productivity, land tenure, and markets for forest products and ecosystem
   services. We conclude that the effects of large-scale restoration
   initiatives on local livelihoods may vary due to several factors and is
   still not clear for many situations; therefore, monitoring over time
   with clear indicators is needed.

Abstract = {This study characterizes the flowering and fruiting phenology of the 13
   most common pioneer tree species in early successional forests of the
   Central Amazon. For each species, 30 individuals, 10 each in three
   secondary forests, were monitored monthly for four years at the
   Biological Dynamics of Forest Fragments Project, north of Manaus. Five
   species showed nearly continuous flowering and fruiting throughout the
   study, indicating that resources were available to pollinators and
   dispersers on a regular basis. The other eight species showed stronger
   seasonality in reproduction, seven of them annually, and one
   supra-annually. Overall, flowering was concentrated in the transition
   from the dry to the rainy season and fruiting was concentrated in the
   rainy season. There was no relationship between reproductive phenology
   and tree pollinator type or dispersal mode. Reproductive phenology was
   remarkably consistent year to year. The pioneer community showed a
   variety of phenological patterns but as a whole tended to be
   characterized by annual flowering and fruiting, either continuously or
   seasonally, thereby fitting generalizations of pioneer species relative
   to mature forest species.},

Journal = {COMPUTERS \& GEOSCIENCES},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {35},

Abstract = {There has been an increasing number of articles stressing the advantage
   of applying remote sensing products of synthetic aperture radar (SAR)
   and interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) for rapidly
   enhancing the volume of geological data in Amazonian areas, where forest
   cover is dense and high, clouds are abundant and accessibility is
   limited. The majority of these studies has emphasized geomorphology as a
   tool for both discussing tectonic reactivations during the Cenozoic and
   reconstructing Quaternary paleolandscapes. This work applies Digital
   Elevation Model (DEM) derived from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission
   (SRTM) for delineating past morphological features under dense
   rainforest in an Amazonian lowland area. Previous use of this tool in
   southwestern Marajo Island (northern Brazil) helped to delineate, with
   exceptional precision, a paleochannel network hidden under the
   rainforest, which would be barely detected with other available remote
   sensing products. Fieldwork revealed that these paleochannels are
   related to palimpsest drainage systems developed mostly during the last
   40,000 C-14 yr B.P. Measured altitudes acquired during topographic
   surveys attested that paleochannel areas are slightly higher than
   adjacent floodplains. This fact determined the successful application of
   SRTM-DEM for mapping paleochannels in Marajo Island. Integration of SRTM
   data with sedimentological information collected during fieldwork
   suggests paleoflows derived from continental areas located to south of
   the study area. This paleodrainage was active when the island was still
   connected to mainland. With island detachment due to reactivation of
   tectonic faults, the channels became abandoned and were progressively
   forested. The results obtained in the present study indicate that
   SRTM-DEM has high potential for unraveling similar morphological
   features from many other Amazonian areas with low topography and a dense
   forest cover. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   Forest of Misiones, Argentina: an Evaluation of the Forest Transition
   Model},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2008},

Abstract = {For many years, tropical and subtropical forests have been deforested
   for agriculture, grazing, and timber extraction. Nevertheless in the
   last decade, several publications have suggested that some regions of
   Latin America are showing a process of forest transition. Forest
   transition theory predicts that industrialization and urbanization will
   lead to the abandonment of marginal agriculture lands and the recovery
   of natural systems such as forests. However, there are many ecological,
   economic, and social factors that could act as barriers to ecosystem
   recovery. To evaluate this hypothesis, we analyzed the socioeconomic and
   land-use changes during the last 30 years at the provincial and
   departmental level in the province of Misiones, Argentina. We described
   the changes in the distribution of urban and rural populations based on
   national population censuses from 1970, 1980, 1991, and 2001. Land-use
   change was based on a supervised analysis of four mosaics of Landsat
   Multispectral Scanner and Thematic Mapper satellite images from 1973,
   1979, 1987/1989, and 2006. Although the change in the rural population
   varied greatly among the departments, there has been a dramatic increase
   in the urban population at the provincial level. The major land-use
   changes between 1973 and 2006 were an increase in monospecific
   plantations of mainly Pinus and Eucalyptus of 2702 km(2) and a loss of
   4689 km(2) of natural forest. Misiones possesses the largest remnant of
   continuous Atlantic Forest, which is famous for its high level of
   biodiversity and endemism, but much of this forest now comprises
   monospecific plantations. Although demographic changes in Misiones are
   similar to those that have occurred other regions (i.e., rural-urban
   migration), and the increase in forest plantations helps to maintain
   forest cover, this cover has much lower ecological value than that of
   natural forest. To ensure the conservation of the high-diversity
   Atlantic Forest in Misiones requires a better effort to understand the
   interactions among the diverse factors that affect land-use patterns in
   this region.},

   2. The ecological groups composed of non-pioneer dominated the forest,

   that 10 years after the exploration, no significant changes were
   observed in the richness, diversity and diametric structure of the
   vegetation, possibly indicating that the forest when submitted to the
   sustainable forest management should maintain its characteristics near
   the forest not disturbed by the logging.},

   Primates},
Journal = {DIVERSITY-BASEL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {12},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Tamarins, small Neotropical primates of the genera Saguinus and
   Leontocebus, have a mainly frugivorous-faunivorous diet. While consuming
   the pulp of a high diversity of fruit species, they also swallow seeds
   and void them intact, thus acting as seed dispersers. Here we compare
   different aspects of the seed dispersal ecology of tamarins with that of
   large Neotropical primates from the genera Ateles (spider monkeys) and
   Lagothrix (woolly monkeys). Due to their small body size, tamarins
   disperse seeds of a smaller size range, fewer seeds per defecation, and
   seeds from a smaller number of different plant species per defecation
   compared to these atelines. We discuss whether tamarin seed dispersal is
   redundant or complementary to seed dispersal by atelines. On the level
   of plant species, our comparisons suggest that redundancy or
   complementarity depends on the plant species concerned. On the habitat
   level, seed dispersal by tamarins and large New World primates is
   probably complementary. Particularly, since tamarins are capable of
   persisting in disturbed forests and near human settlements, they are
   more likely to contribute to the natural regeneration of such areas than
   larger primates.},

Year = {2016},
Volume = {17},

Abstract = {In hyper fragmented biomes, conservation of extant biota relies on
   preservation and proper management of remnants. The maintenance of
   genetic diversity and functional connectivity in a landscape context is
   probably key to long-term conservation of remnant populations. We
   measured the genetic diversity in seedlings and adults of tree Copaifera
   langsdorffii and evaluated whether edge and density-dependent effects
   drive natural regeneration in a set of very small and degraded Brazilian
   Atlantic forest fragments. We evaluated the role of small remnants in
   the conservation of genetic diversity in a hyper fragmented landscape
   and discuss the challenge of long-term population sustainability of such
   altered habitats. High genetic diversity in adults indicated these
   fragments are valuable targets for C. langsdorffii in situ conservation,
   but both genetic diversity and divergence among patches decreased in
   seedlings. In our landscape, regeneration increased as it neared edges
   and adults; suggesting this population is resilient to fragmentation.
   However, at a broader scale, current levels of gene flow have not been

Abstract = {Large-scale forest conversion in Brazil, primarily to cattle pasture,
   contributes significantly to the global anthropogenic emission of CO2
   into the atmosphere. An alternative land-use, namely extractive reserves
   for forest residents, may serve as one means of using Amazonian forests
   sustainably and of maintaining carbon in living matter rather than
   adding it to that in the atmosphere.
   In the Seringal (former rubber estate) Porongaba (6,800 ha) of the Chico
   Mendes Extractive Reserve, Acre, Brazil, primary forest still covers
   more than 90\% of the area. Total biomass in primary forest is estimated
   at 426 tons per ha, equivalent to 213 t C per ha. Rubber tappers
   effectively maintain about 60,000 tons of carbon per household (family
   unit) in forest biomass and thus out of the atmosphere. Deforestation of
   primary forest was less than 0.6\% per yr - much less than rates of
   natural disturbances for other neotropical forests.
   Slash-and-burn agriculture in the Seringal Porongaba releases carbon at
   a gross rate of some 200 t C per yr per household. Net releases are much
   less, as regrowth forests absorb carbon at rates of about 9 t C per ha
   per yr. The net areal flux of carbon to the atmosphere from land-use in
   Seringal is much less than one ton of carbon per ha per yr, which is
   equivalent to less than 0.3\% per yr of the carbon stock in forest
   biomass. If Seringal Porongaba is typical of the three million hectares
   in extractive reserves in Brazilian Amazonia, then these reserves are
   calculated to retain 0.6 Gigatons of carbon in the terrestrial biota.
   Adverse changes in income patterns for rubber tappers could lead to
   abandonment of extractive reserves or increased deforestation within
   them. Diversification and improvement of income from non-timber forest
   products are needed to maintain rubber tappers in extractive reserves.
   Most beneficiaries of carbon storage in these and other reserves live
   outside Brazil; devising means of recompensation for these benefits is a
   challenge for the global society.},

Abstract = {Centuries of colonization of the Atlantic Forest biome in Brazil have
   led its native vegetation cover to be reduced to only 11.7\%. On the
   other hand, regional land changes have fostered natural forest
   regeneration, since the 1960s, in the region of Paraiba Valley. A
   fieldwork survey in rural properties was conducted in three
   municipalities (n = 90, thirty in each municipality), to assess how
   forest transition is affected by the region's socioeconomic development
   and biophysical dimensions of the landscape. To select the
   municipalities among thirty-four, we applied the modified Thompson Tau
   technique to detect outlier values for three selected variables: Natural
   forest cover, eucalyptus plantation cover, and municipal revenue. The
   outliers were dropped from consideration and the municipality with the
   maximum value for each variable was selected. Based on the survey and
   GIS analysis using land-cover maps, topography, and hydrology variables,
   we concluded that the diminished land-use pressure in the Paraiba
   Valley, a response to the regional economic development (e.g.,
   increasing labor demand in urban areas pushing rural migration),
   resulted in the increase of the Atlantic forest cover. Interestingly
   enough, a counter-migration of people moving to rural areas as a newly
   valued amenity has the potential to reshape the rural landscape with
   positive outcomes to the Atlantic forest cover.},

Abstract = {Techniques for forest restoration have been widely developed over the
   past decades, allowing the reestablishment of vegetation in extreme
   cases such as surface mining. However, there are still issues related to
   management and monitoring that require further understanding, especially
   concerning comparisons with reference ecosystems. In this study,
   hierarchical agglomerative clustering (HAC) with uncertainty estimation
   is proposed as a methodology for forest restoration assessment. For this
   purpose, analysis was made of phytosociological variables for 27 plots
   located in reforested closed mines and in the Amazon forest reference
   ecosystem. The technique grouped the reference ecosystem separately from
   the reclamation sites. The HAC was affected by dependency among the
   analyzed variables, and heterogeneity was observed for all the
   phytosociological parameters in the cluster groups formed by the mining
   locations. However, each group showed specific characteristics related
   to the different environmental conditions and the forest restoration
   performance. The results demonstrated that HAC with uncertainty
   estimation was more suitable for defining groups, compared to the
   classical approach, offering a promising methodology for evaluation of
   the outcomes of forest restoration and for guiding management actions in
   disturbed tropical forests.},

Abstract = {Seedlings from 43 native woody species belonging to different
   successional groups from the Tibagi River Basin, Parana State, South
   Brazil were studied to obtain information on the importance of
   colonization by native arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi. The experiment
   was carried out in a greenhouse for 15 to 45 wk, with soil-mix
   treatments and four successional groups. The mycorrhizal dependency was
   90, 48, 12 and 14\% of the pioneer, early secondary, late secondary and
   climax species, respectively. The content of P, Ca and K was 20, 17 and
   23 times greater, respectively, in the leaves of the pioneer species
   than in the other successional groups. The colonization by AM fungi in
   field was studied in seedlings of 36 native woody species collected in
   the interior of the forest of the Mata dos Godoy State Park, and in open
   area at the beginning of arboreal succession. The mycorrhizal
   colonization in the field was 55.5, 26.9, 6.1 and 2.2\% for the pioneer,
   early secondary, late secondary and climax species, respectively. To
   assess the mycorrhizal inoculum potential, rhizosphere soil was
   collected in the interior of the forest and a gap in the same forest and
   in a cleared area abandoned for natural regeneration. The inoculum
   potentials and the spore number in the area at the beginning of
   succession were 5.6 and 53.4 times greater than in the interior of the
   forest. The results show that the initial growth of the woody species
   which take part in the initial phases of succession may be more
   dependent on the AM fungi, in soils poor in minerals, while those that
   make up the final succession phases may be less dependent. The potential
   of the AM fungi inoculum decreases throughout the successional process
   and there is a relation between the inoculum potential found in the
   field and the occurrence for the different habitats of the species of
   adult plants belonging to different successional groups.},

Abstract = {The objective of the present work was to compare the orbital images from
   the CBERS 2, IRS-P6 and the Quickbird satellites, for the mapping of the
   stadiums of ecological succession, using different methods of
   classification of orbital images. The study area included the native
   forest reserves of the Macedonia forest project, located in the cities
   of Bugre and Ipaba, between the parallels 19 degrees 19'00{''}S and 19
   degrees 24'30{''}S and the meridians 42 degrees 27'00{''}W and 42
   degrees 21'00{''}W, Minas Gerais state. The visual, per region and
   pixel-based classifications were used. In order to evaluate the
   classification accuracy of each method, a matrix of errors was generated
   and the Kappa index was calculated. The Z test was used in order to test
   the statistical significance of the difference between two Kappa
   indices. Altogether, the best results were the classifications obtained
   in the visual and region-based methods, with values of kappa higher than
   those for pixel-based classifications. The image resulting from the
   fusion of IRS and CBERS images, which were classified through the method
   of regions, obtained the best Kappa index, and was in the level
   considered as good. The problems of separation among the classes
   resulted in classifications with a low degree of accuracy. This can be
   explained by the spectral similarity present between the targets
   (initial, medium and advanced stadiums), the small variation among the
   numerical values of the pixels, the existence of overlapping among
   classes and the low spectral resolution of sensors.},

   ecological processes, able to characterize different areas in
   restoration. The vegetation of the upper stratum was sampled in 18 plots
   of 10 x 20 m, in two recovered areas (A1 and A2), and in 12 plots in a
   forest area used as reference (AR). In these plots, the tree- shrub
   component was measured as for the diameter, height and canopy coverage
   of individuals and natural regeneration was studied in subplots, through
   the obtention of the root collar diameter and height. The enzyme
   activity was measured through the collection of 10 soil samples, in
   layers ranging from 0 to 5 cm and 5 to 20 cm in each area. The results
   showed that the areas in restoration presented lower diversity (H' =

   basal area, height and density. It is concluded that the enzyme activity
   a good indicator for the development in both areas restored, which

Abstract = {Hydrological processes in forests are greatly influenced by existing

   consumption by these plant communities is considered important in
   studies of water availability and water balance, especially in semi-arid
   regions. The aim of this study was to analyse water storage potential in

   carried out in a preserved area of Caatinga in the Aivaba Experimental
   Basin, Ceara, Brazil, where a phytosociological survey of the spatial
   distribution of wood density and stem water storage capacity was
   conducted. Allometric models were developed to estimate the active xylem
   area. Thirteen species and eight botanical families were registered
   during the floristic survey. The species with the highest density per
   hectare are the marmeleiro (Croton sonderianus Mull.) and the
   catingueira (Poicianella pyramidalis Tul.), reaching 85\% of the total
   number of inventoried species. The water content in the stem of the
   catingueira is around five times that of the marmeleiro; however, due to
   their greater occurrence in the area, the amount of water retained in
   the stem of marmeleiro plants (per hectare) is around twice that of the
   catingueira plants. After 40 years of conservation, the area is at a
   stage of secondary succession. The water potential of the species
   included in the survey is equal to about one fifth of the maximum
   storage capacity of the reservoir that receives all the water drained

Abstract = {(Limitations of native forest species use may contribute to erosion of
   traditional and local ecological knowledge among family farmers).
   Traditional or local ecological knowledge is developed from the
   continuous relationship between humans and their environment, mainly
   through the daily use of natural resources. The abandonment of uses, on
   the other hand, may cause the loss of this kind of knowledge, which
   frequently occurs due to changes in life style. lit this paper, we aimed
   to evaluate the knowledge and the dynamics of the effective use of
   native forests in western Santa Catarina state, Brazil. Data collection
   and analysis were based on the integration of qualitative and
   quantitative ethnobotanical methods. The results revealed that farmers
   have comprehensive knowledge of the native forest species of the region
   and the effective present use of these forest resources is mainly for
   subsistence, highlighting the dependence of farmers on firewood.
   However, timber use has declined in recent years due, mainly, to
   limitations of legal access to native forest species. Farmers older than
   40 years cited higher species richness, with a more equitable
   distribution of species, compared to younger farmers, lit addition,
   attenuation of the correlation between knowledge and present use of
   species among younger people was noticed. The data suggest the existence
   of a gradual process of loss of transmission of traditional local
   knowledge and that there is a risk of erosion of accumulated knowledge.},

Abstract = {Both second-growth and agroforestry systems (AFs) have the potential for
   recovering thousands of abandoned pasturelands in Amazon. The AFs may do
   it faster and, at the same time, produce direct economic benefits for
   farmers. Improved nutrient recycling may be expected due to distinctive
   litter production in AFs, but lacks experimental data yet. The stocks of
   carbon and nutrients of the litter layer under different agroforestry
   systems ( AFs) were investigated at an abandoned pasture site, 60 km
   north of Manaus. The experimental design consisted of three blocks, with
   five treatments: four different types of 5-year-old AFs and a secondary
   forest ( CAP). Litter layer was sampled in the wet and dry seasons,
   sorted according to the predominant plant species and analysed for
   carbon and nutrient concentrations. The litter layer in the control
   plots was much larger than in the AFs, and thus, the carbon stocks in
   the litter layer of the control (wet = 489 g m(2); dry = 783 g m(2))
   were larger than in the AFs. However, due to a clearly higher
   concentration of nutrients in the litter from the AFs, some nutrient
   stocks were similar or even greater than in the control. The planted
   timber species and the green manures were important sources of K and Ca
   to the litter layer while the peach-palm was an important source of Mg.
   In general, the litter of AFs had lower C: nutrient ratios than the
   litter in the secondary forest control, indicating a faster nutrient
   recycling in the AFs.},

Journal = {BIOTROPICA},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {50},
Number = {3},
Pages = {491-498},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Multi-year studies comparing changes in litterfall biomass and nutrient
   inputs in sites under different restoration practices are lacking. We
   evaluated litterfall dynamics and nutrient inputs at 5yr and after a
   decade of recovery in four treatments (natural regenerationno planting,
   plantationentire area planted, tree islandsplanting in patches, and
   reference forest) at multiple sites in an agricultural landscape in
   southern Costa Rica. We inter-planted two native species (Terminalia
   amazonia and Vochysia guatemalensis) and two naturalized N-fixing
   species (Inga edulis and Erythrina poeppigiana) in plantation and island
   treatments. Although litterfall N was higher in plantations in the first
   sampling period, litter production and overall inputs of C, N, Ca, Mg,
   P, Cu, Mn, and Fe did not differ between island, plantation, or
   reference forest after a decade; however, all were greater than in
   natural regeneration. Potassium inputs were lower in the natural
   regeneration, intermediate in island and plantation, and greater in
   reference forest. The percentage of litterfall comprised by the N-fixing
   planted species declined by nearly two-thirds in both plantations and
   islands between sampling periods, while the percentage of
   V.guatemalensis more than doubled, and the percentage from naturally
   regenerated species increased from 27 to 47 percent in islands. Island
   and plantation treatments were equally effective at restoring litterfall
   and nutrient inputs to levels similar to the reference system. The
   nutrient input changed substantially over the 7-yr interval between
   measurements, reflecting shifts in vegetation composition and
   demonstrating how rapidly nutrient cycling dynamics can change in
   recovering forests.
   Resumen Los estudios a largo plazo que comparan los cambios en biomasa
   de hojarasca y en aportes de nutrientes en sitios bajo diferentes
   practicas de restauracion son escasos. Este trabajo evaluo la dinamica
   de la hojarasca y la disponibilidad de nutrientes a los 5 anos y despues
   de una decada en cuatro tratamientos de restauracion: regeneracion
   natural (sin plantar), plantacion (toda la superficie plantada), islas
   de arboles (plantas en seis parches) y bosque de referencia en multiples
   sitios en un paisaje agricola en el sur de Costa Rica. Se intercalaron
   dos especies nativas (Terminalia amazonia y Vochysia guatemalensis) y
   dos especies naturalizadas fijadoras de nitrogeno (Inga edulis y
   Erythrina poeppigiana) en los tratamientos plantacion e islas. Aunque el
   aporte de N en la hojarasca fue mas alto en plantacion en la primera
   evaluacion, la produccion de hojarasca y en general los aportes totales
   de C, N, Ca, Mg, P, Cu, Mn y Fe no difirieron entre los tratamientos de
   isla, plantacion o el bosque de referencia despues de una decada; sin
   embargo, todos fueron mayores que en la regeneracion natural. Los
   aportes de K fueron menores en la regeneracion natural, intermedios en
   la isla y plantacion, y mayores en el bosque de referencia. El
   porcentaje de hojarasca compuesto por especies fijadoras de N plantadas
   disminuyo casi dos tercios del primero al segundo periodo de muestreo,
   mientras que para V.guatemalensis fue mas del doble en plantaciones e
   islas, y el porcentaje producido por especies de regeneracion natural
   aumento de 27 a 47\% en islas. Los tratamientos de isla y plantacion
   fueron igualmente efectivos para restaurar los aportes de hojarasca y
   nutrientes a niveles similares al sistema de referencia. El aporte de
   nutrientes cambio sustancialmente durante el intervalo de 7 anos entre
   mediciones, reflejando cambios en la composicion de la vegetacion, lo
   que demuestra la rapidez con que la dinamica del ciclo de nutrientes
   puede cambiar en bosques en recuperacion.},

   among the habitats was found. However, analyses indicated the existence
   of greater similarities among the sampling points belonging to the same

Abstract = {This study evaluates biotic responses, using ants as bio-indicators, to
   relatively recent anthropogenic disturbances to mature forest in central
   Amazonia. The structure of the ground-foraging ant community was
   compared in four habitats that represented a gradient of disturbance
   associated with differences in land use. Ants were collected in
   undisturbed, mature forest, in an abandoned pasture, in a young regrowth
   forest (situated in a former pasture area), and in an old regrowth
   forest (established where mature forest was just cleared and abandoned).
   More ant species were found in mature and old regrowth forest than in
   the abandoned pasture. By contrast, ant abundance tended to decrease
   with forest maturity. Both pasture and young regrowth forest exhibited a
   distinct ant species composition compared to mature forest, whereas
   species composition in the old regrowth forest showed greater similarity
   to that of mature forest. In spite of differences in fallow time between
   former pasture areas and non-pasture areas, there is evidence that
   different land-management practices do result in different rates of
   recovery of the ant forest fauna after land abandonment. In any case,
   recuperation of the ground-foraging ant fauna appears to be faster than
   regeneration of the woody-plant community. In this sense, regrowth
   forests may be valuable for the conservation of ground-foraging ants and
   perhaps for other components of mature-forest leaf-litter fauna within
   the context of a fragmented landscape.},

Journal = {REVISTA DE BIOLOGIA TROPICAL},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {63},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {In tropical dry forests, the dynamics of herbaceous populations is
   strongly influenced by seasonal and annual variation in total rainfall.
   Moreover, the present and past events of climatic anomalies (e.g. severe
   drought years and erratic rain before the growth season) may cause
   drastic reductions in population size, leading to the temporal
   disappearance of some species. Therefore, this three-year study aimed to
   assess the dynamics of Delilia biflora (Asteraceae), Commelina obliqua
   (Commelinaceae), Phaseolus peduncularis (Fabaceae) and Euphorbia
   heterophylla (Euphorbiaceae). The study was conducted in an area of
   tropical dry forest known as Caatinga, situated in the experimental
   station of the Pernambuco Agronomic Institute (IPA), in Caruaru,
   Pernambuco, Brazil. The Caatinga has a semiarid climate with strong
   seasonal and annual variation in total precipitation. During this study,
   there was a climatic anomaly event called the 2006 drought, and also
   erratic rains in the dry season. The birth, death and survival of plants
   were evaluated monthly using 105 plots (1 x 1 m). Differences in density
   between years and seasons were evaluated using the Kruskal-Wallis test.
   The explanatory power of present and past precipitation on density was
   evaluated using the General Linear Model. In this study, we present the
   first record of Euphorbia heterophylla in the studied area. The studied
   populations were larger during the rainy seasons and in wet years, and
   were drastically reduced in the driest year and dry seasons. Commelina
   obliqua was the least sensitive to variation in total rainfall.
   Regarding the variation in density, all four species were present during
   all three years. Birth rates were higher during the rainy season, and
   death rates were higher in the dry season. Sporadic rain in the dry
   season caused pronounced seedling recruitment followed by death, and had
   a strong impact on the dynamics of D. biflora, E. heterophylla and P.
   peduncularis. The precipitation of the current year explained between 3
   \% - 18 \% of the inter-annual density variation, and the explanatory
   power of the previous year precipitation on the density of populations
   ranged from 32 \% to 67 \%. Therefore, climatic events of the past also
   have a significant consequence over the four populations. In conclusion,
   drastic reduction in total precipitation between years may be considered
   as a predictive parameter for herbaceous plants population size (in the
   present and future time) in a Northeastern Brazilian tropical dry forest
   area.},

Abstract = {Loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) was a minor component of the vast natural
   forests of the southern United States before the region was settled by
   immigrants. Extensive planting and natural regeneration of cutover
   forest land and abandoned farmland between 1930 and 1990 made loblolly
   the leading timber species in the United States. It now predominates on
   13.4 million ha (45 percent) of the commercial forest land in the
   southern United States (between latitudes 28 degrees N and 39 degrees N
   and longitudes 75 degrees W and 97 degrees W) and directly or indirectly
   provides 110,000 jobs and \$30 billion to the economy of the region. The
   extreme versatility of loblolly has also provided important
   environmental contributions to most southern states. These include
   landscape beautification, erosion control, soil amelioration, excellent
   wildlife habitat, and outstanding recreational opportunities.
   Incorporating existing pest management strategies into silvicultural
   systems can produce substantial and long-lasting insect and disease
   control with little cost or physical effort. Introductions of loblolly
   into numerous countries around the world (especially China, Brazil, and
   Argentina) have proven to be very successful, environmentally sound, and
   commercially profitable. In some locations, loblolly grows much faster
   than on sites of similar quality in the southern United States.},

Journal = {REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {280},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The mapping of sugarcane plantations and their changes is relevant to
   the economy and the environment, notably due to sugarcane's interface in
   the biofuel industry through ethanol. The necessary mapping of
   sugar-cane crop changes is especially challenging when plantation occurs
   under smallholders' land ownership struc-tures used for heterogeneous
   crop management. We evaluated two approaches to address this challenge
   with the example of sugarcane abandonment in the Norte Fluminense
   Region, Northeastern Rio de Janeiro state, Brazil. The region is
   characterized by a large share of smallholders. We trained a random
   forest classifier for sugarcane for 2018 based on all available Landsat
   imagery. Based on the concept of temporal generalization, we applied the
   classifier trained in 2018 for the period from 1986 until 2020. The
   resulting annual sugarcane probability maps were used as input for two
   abandonment mapping methods: LandtrendR and muti-temporal cropland
   aban-donment mapping. The performance of both approaches was evaluated
   based on a stratified sampling approach. We detected three distinct
   trajectories for sugarcane farmland: i) permanently abandoned sugarcane,
   ii) fallow sugarcane, and iii) and stable sugarcane. The multi-temporal
   cropland abandonment mapping performed better for the sugarcane
   abandonment class (F1 = 0.84) than the LandtrendR approach (F1 = 0.21).
   The LandtrendR results revealed a higher omission (PA = 0.12) in mapping
   the sugarcane abandonment class. For the multi -temporal cropland
   abandonment mapping, we found that 66\% (67,353 ha) of the stable
   sugarcane areas were abandoned between 1990 and 2016. The highest
   abandonment rates occurred between 1990 and 1994 and between 2010 and
   2016. The spatial distribution of abandonment was heterogeneous. The
   earliest abandonment was concentrated in the northern part of the study
   area. The most recent abandonment was more extensive in the southern
   part of the study site. Our results highlight the advantages and
   challenges of using Landsat time series to map sugarcane abandonment in
   a heterogeneous management system. Our results also highlight the
   spatially and temporal heterogeneous pattern of sugarcane abandonment in
   the region and provide the necessary database for subsequent studies to
   identify underlying and proximate causes for the abandonment.},

   recovering of riparian forest has been implemented on their farms,
   considering their importance for the environment and the relation built
   between those areas, the Amazonian rural populations and their water
   resources. Thus, a field research was developed in Itabocal, countryside
   of Irituia's municipality, Northeast of Para. The research was based on
   the principles of systemic approach and interdisciplinarity. The
   conservation of local watercourses stands out as the most important
   influence for the riparian forest recovering. The different processes of
   forest recovering on those areas were characterized and classified
   between three categories: Enrichment of Regenerating Forest, Natural
   Regeneration and Agroforestry Systems. The lack of public policies was
   pointed as the main obstacle for the recovering of those vegetations. It
   was accomplished that the relevance of riparian forest recovering is
   tied to the relation that the studied population, as well as overall
   Amazonian communities, have with water.},

Abstract = {Climate change is expected to impact the hydrological regime worldwide,
   and land use and land cover change may alter the effects of the former
   in some cases. Secondary growth in deforested and abandoned areas is one
   of the main consequences of land use and cover changes in Amazonia.
   Among land uses, the effects of the secondary growth in water
   availability in large scale basins are not well understood. This work
   analyzes the potential effects of secondary growth under climate and
   land use change on water availability and hydropower in the Tocantins
   basin, in the Legal Amazon region of Brazil, using the MHD-INPE
   hydrological model driven by different climate scenarios and two future
   socioeconomic-based potential land use scenarios. The model projects
   decrease on discharge under climate change scenarios, which further
   cause the simulated hydropower energy potential to decrease
   significantly. When only deforestation scenarios are included, the
   effects of climate change are weakened, but when secondary growth is
   also considered, the effects of climate change are enhanced. Results
   suggest that different aspects of environmental change, such as
   secondary growth, may affect water production and the sectors depending
   on it.},

Journal = {ACTA OECOLOGICA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY},

Abstract = {When an area previously used for agricultural or sylvicultural purposes
   is abandoned, it may undergo natural regeneration. However, the outcome
   of such regeneration depends on a number of factors, including the
   presence of non-native invasive plants, and, when production forests
   such as eucalypt plantations are considered, remaining non-native trees
   may also affect the natural regeneration possibilities. We studied how
   remaining eucalypt trees affect woody species regeneration and invasive
   grasses in an abandoned Eucalyptus grandis plantation in a regenerating
   Brazilian savanna site. We sampled the woody vegetation and invasive
   grasses in 30 8 x 8-m plots and surveyed the eucalypt trees within these
   plots and in 3 m-wide strips around them. Eucalypts negatively affected
   the cover of the C4 invasive African grass Melinis minutiflora and the
   total abundance and basal area of native woody plants in general and of
   two dominant species, suggesting an overall negative effect on native
   plant regeneration notwithstanding the also negative effects on African
   grasses. Conversely, they had no effect on species richness, species
   diversity nor mean height of woody plant communities nor on the
   abundance of three other dominant native woody species. Interestingly, a
   low eucalypt abundance had small effects on native woody species but
   much stronger effects on the cover of M. minutiflora, possibly due to
   shading. Thus, our results indicate that remaining eucalypt trees may
   hamper the natural regeneration of native woody plants, but also suggest
   that maintaining a low density of eucalypt trees may be a cost-effective
   strategy, given the high costs associated with the complete removal of
   remaining trees and the difficulties in controlling invasions by African
   grasses.},

Abstract = {Climate change is a global phenomenon that affects biophysical systems
   and human well-being. The Paris Agreement of the United Nations
   Framework Convention on Climate Change entered into force in 2016 with
   the objective of strengthening the global response to climate change by
   keeping global temperature rise this century well below 2 degrees C
   above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the
   temperature increase even further to 1.5 degrees C. The agreement
   requires all Parties to submit their ``nationally determined
   contributions{''} (NDCs) and to strengthen these efforts in the years
   ahead. Reducing carbon emissions from deforestation and forest
   degradation is an important strategy for mitigating climate change,
   particularly in developing countries with large forests. Extensive
   tropical forest loss and degradation have increased awareness at the
   international level of the need to undertake large-scale ecological
   restoration, highlighting the need to identify cases in which
   restoration strategies can contribute to mitigation and adaptation. Here
   we consider Brazil as a case study to evaluate the benefits and
   challenges of implementing large-scale restoration programs in
   developing countries. The Brazilian NDC included the target of restoring
   and reforesting 12 million hectares of forests for multiple uses by
   2030. Restoration of native vegetation is one of the foundations of
   sustainable rural development in Brazil and should consider multiple
   purposes, from biodiversity and ecosystem services conservation to
   social and economic development. However, ecological restoration still
   presents substantial challenges for tropical and mega-diverse countries,
   including the need to develop plans that are technically and financially
   feasible, as well as public policies and monitoring instruments that can
   assess effectiveness. The planning, execution, and monitoring of
   restoration efforts strongly depend on the context and the diagnosis of
   the area with respect to reference ecosystems (e.g., forests, savannas,
   grasslands, wetlands). In addition, poor integration of climate change
   policies at the national and subnational levels and with other sectorial
   policies constrains the large-scale implementation of restoration
   programs. The case of Brazil shows that slowing deforestation is
   possible; however, this analysis highlights the need for increased
   national commitment and international support for actions that require
   large-scale transformations of the forest sector regarding ecosystem
   restoration efforts. Scaling up the ambitions and actions of the Paris
   Agreement implies the need for a global framework that recognizes
   landscape restoration as a cost-effective nature-based solution and that
   supports countries in addressing their remaining needs, challenges, and
   barriers.},

Abstract = {Although there has been a long tradition in plant ecology of grouping
   species into functional groups, there is a lack of consensus regarding
   both the successional status of species and the dynamics of forest
   recovery. Therefore, plant species are commonly classified into two
   groups: early successional pioneers and late successional or even climax
   species. Here, we aimed to answer the following question: if pioneer and
   late successional species have different photosynthetic characteristics,
   will these differences be translated to improved performance when plants
   are grown under similar conditions, particularly high irradiance and
   different water regimes? To this end, we investigated gas exchange,
   photoprotection, plasticity, and nutritional traits in ten native
   species that were subject to natural variations in photosynthetically
   active radiation, rainfall, and air temperature throughout the year. Our
   results provided evidence that photosynthesis is directly dependent on
   nitrogen and phosphorus. Remarkably, this characteristic increased in
   importance when the species were grouped into pioneer and late
   successional species compared with each species separately. Furthermore,
   principal component analysis demonstrated that physiological traits are
   excellent parameters for characterizing the pioneer and late
   successional plants growing in situ under the same irradiance. Our
   findings indicate that the responses of trees to seasonal variations
   depend on their ability to absorb nutrients to meet the mineral
   requirements to sustain long-term growth. We further analyzed the
   mechanisms that allow woody species to cope with drought stress.},

Abstract = {The ruderal babassu palm (Attalea speciosa) is expanding on large areas
   of degraded Amazon landscapes. Decomposition of leaves and roots is in
   the center of plant:soil interactions. We evaluated decomposition and
   nutrient concentrations of leaves and fine roots of babassu in
   comparison with two exotic reference species, Acacia mangium (slow
   degradability) and Leucaena leucocephala (fast degradability), in a
   138-day litterbag assay carried out in secondary forest stands of
   different age and babassu abundance. We chose 4-mm over 2-mm mesh
   litterbags based on a pilot study. Babassu leaves degraded slower than
   leaves of A. mangium and L. leucocephala, and also had lower nitrogen,
   phosphorus and calcium concentrations in all stages of decomposition. By
   contrast, potassium concentrations in babassu leaves were higher than in
   both reference species at 0 and 50 days. Roots of all three species
   decomposed slower than leaves. Compared to the leaves, both biomass loss
   and nutrient concentrations differed less between babassu and
   reference-species roots, except for lower nitrogen concentration in
   babassu roots. Leaf-litter decomposition of all three species was
   significantly faster in old than in young secondary forest, suggesting
   an acceleration of decomposition along succession. Babassu leaves
   decomposed faster in old babassu-dominated than non-dominated secondary
   forest, pointing to the existence of specialized decomposer communities

Abstract = {Species diversity can contribute to the resilience of the ecosystem and
   can be assessed through the soil seed bank (SSB). SSB is an indicator of
   forest development after the occurrence of disturbances. Thus, this
   study aimed at evaluating the relation of the soil fertility with the
   soil seed bank and the variation of seed bank species diversity at
   distinct successional stages after abandonment of pasture (25, 35, 45
   and > 50 years). Ten samples of soil were collected per site, being
   distributed in trays and arranged in a greenhouse for a germination
   analysis. Results indicate that species diversity in SSB is higher in
   young forests than in mature forests. In addition, soil characteristics
   are different among successional stages, in which the young forests are
   associated with higher availability of nutrients. Finally, forests in
   early stages have higher potential for recovery of degraded areas in
   relation to the forest seed bank in advanced stages.},

Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},

Abstract = {There has been an increase in the area of secondary tropical forests in
   recent years due to forest restoration in degraded areas. Recent
   analyses suggest that the success of passive forest restoration is
   highly uncertain and needs to be better understood. This study aimed to
   investigate the behavior of saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ks) and
   some hydrophysical soil attributes between agricultural land uses,
   restored forests, and a degraded forest fragment. The areas evaluated
   are located in the municipality of Rio Claro, Sao Paulo, Brazil, under
   different types of land use: (i) two areas in the process of passive
   forest restoration: one of 18 and another of 42 years (NR18 and NR42);
   (ii) a degraded forest fragment (FFD); (iii) pasture (P), and (iv)
   sugarcane (SC). The hydraulic soil conductivity characterization was
   performed using the Beerkan method. Dry soil bulk density (BD), total
   porosity (Pt), macroporosity (Mac), microporosity (Mic), penetration
   resistance (PR), mean aggregate diameter (MWD), and soil organic carbon
   (OC) were also determined. The comparative analysis of the hydrophysical
   attributes of the soil superficial horizon in agricultural land uses (P
   and SC), restored forests (NR18 and NR42), and a degraded forest (DFF)
   confirms that the recovery of soil hydrological functioning in ongoing
   forest restoration processes can be a relatively slow process. In
   addition, the intensity of previous land use leaves footprints that can
   affect passive restoration areas for decades after agriculture
   abandonment, increasing the time for the recovery ofKsand soil
   hydrophysical attributes.},

Abstract = {Facilitation is an important ecological mechanism with potential
   applications to forest restoration. We hypothesized that different
   facilitation treatments, distance from the forest edge and time since
   initiation of the experiment would affect forest restoration on
   abandoned pastures. Seed and seedling abundance, species richness and
   composition were recorded monthly during two years under isolated trees,
   bird perches and in open pasture. Seed arrival and seedling
   establishment were measured at 10 m and 300 m from the forest edge. We
   sampled a total of 131,826 seeds from 115 species and 487 seedlings from
   46 species. Isolated trees and bird perches increased re-establishment
   of forest species; however, species richness was higher under isolated
   trees. Overall, abundance and richness of seeds and seedlings differed
   between sampling years, but was unaffected by distance from the forest
   edge. On the other hand, species composition of seeds and seedlings
   differed among facilitation treatments, distance from the forest edge
   and between years. Seedling establishment success rate was larger in
   large-seeded species than medium-and small-seeded species. Our results
   suggest that isolated trees enhance forest re-establishment, while bird
   perches provide a complementary effort to restore tree abundance in
   abandoned pastures. However, the importance of seed arrival facilitation
   shifts toward establishment facilitation over time. Arriving species may
   vary depending on the distance from the forest edge and disperser
   attractors. Efforts to restore tropical forests on abandoned pastures
   should take into account a combination of both restoration strategies,
   effects of time and proximity to forest edge to maximize regeneration.},

Title = {Challenges and opportunities for large-scale reforestation in the
   Eastern Amazon using native species},
Journal = {FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {466},
Month = {JUN 15},
Abstract = {Reforestation and forest restoration are recognized as an effective
   means of halting biodiversity loss and increasing the performance of
   ecosystem services such as carbon sequestration and the protection and
   maintenance of water resources. The objective of this review is to
   describe the main challenges and opportunities for large-scale forest
   restoration and reforestation using native species in the Amazon,
   focusing on Para state and the Itacaiunas watershed. Large-scale forest
   restoration and reforestation in the Eastern Amazon may contribute to
   meeting national and global restoration commitments and
   reducing/eliminating the actual forest deficit caused by noncompliance
   with the Brazilian Native Vegetation Protection Law, concomitantly
   mitigating impacts on climate change, enhancing ecosystem services
   (e.g., protection of water resources and reduction of soil erosion) and
   maintaining biodiversity. The selection of active and passive
   reforestation approaches depends on land-use history, landscape context
   and reforestation targets, and the promotion of natural regeneration
   reduces implementation costs. To measure the ecological and
   socioeconomic success of forest restoration and reforestation, a large
   number of on-the-ground and remote indicators are available, and the use
   of a combination of both methods can reduce the monitoring cost. The
   socioeconomic benefits of reforestation include financial gains from
   restoration and carbon programs; furthermore, the commercialization of
   timber and non-timber products and their use for subsistence may improve
   livelihoods and farm incomes. Nevertheless, implementation of
   large-scale reforestation in the Eastern Amazon requires research
   regarding the selection and the nutritional demands of native species
   and the development of adequate soil management strategies that promote
   the growth of native species and yields. The insufficient availability
   of seeds and seedlings is a major bottleneck for large-scale forest
   restoration and reforestation with native species. Thus, increasing the
   availability, diversity and quality of seedlings and seeds of native
   species to supply the demand for planting activities, as well as the
   registration of producers in the National Register of Seeds and
   Seedlings, is necessary to achieve compliance with national legislation
   and international commitments. Competition between reforestation and the
   expansion of agricultural and cattle ranching frontiers combined with a
   lack of markets for commercial products from restored areas constrains
   the socioeconomic viability of large-scale reforestation. To outweigh
   deforestation incentives, regulation and effective implementation of
   markets and programs such as REDD+, CDM and PES is thus paramount. To
   enhance the integration of human well-being, socioeconomic enhancements
   and ecological functionality, forest and landscape restoration concepts
   offer promising tools for the region.},

Journal = {REVISTA ARVORE},

Abstract = {The partial or complete loss of vegetation cover triggers an increase in

   interventions should prioritize the recovery of areas most vulnerable to

   aid of Geographic Information Systems - the temporal and spatial
   likelihood of fire occurrences in spring recharge areas undergoing
   ecological restoration and contributing to hydroelectric reservoirs in
   southern Minas Gerais, Brazil. The findings indicated that the months
   with the highest probability of wildfire occurrences were August and
   September (accounting for 66\% of cases), requiring increased attention
   to prevention efforts. Furthermore, locations most susceptible to fires
   (steeper slopes, more flammable vegetation, and higher anthropogenic

Abstract = {A GIS (geographic information systems) database was constructed from
   aerial photographs, a vegetation map, and topographic map data of the
   Ngeremeduu Bay Drainage Area (NBDA), Palau, to examine relationships
   between upland land cover dynamics, environmental variables, and past
   land use. In 1992, 82.9 percent of the NBDA was forest, 16.6 percent was
   grassland, and 0.5 percent consisted of village areas. Between 1947 and
   1992, there was a 11.2 percent reduction of grassland area primarily due
   to a 10.9 percent increase in forest cover. These land cover changes led
   to larger, more continuous stretches of forest and numerous, highly
   fragmented grassland patches. Significant relationships (P < 0.001) were
   found between the spatial distribution of forest and grassland cover and
   slope, elevation, soil pH, and percent soil organic matter. These
   patterns, however, may have resulted from past farm site selection
   rather than from ecological relationships. Our results indicate that
   areas of forest expansion were significantly (P < 0.001) associated with
   the location of abandoned agricultural communities. In addition, over 92
   percent of areas of forest expansion occurred within 100 m of
   established forest. These results suggest that the proximity of
   established forest facilitate forest recovery following human
   disturbance.},

Title = {Slash-and-burn agriculture disrupts the carbon storage potential and

Journal = {AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS \& ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {381},
Month = {APR 1},
Abstract = {Urgent action is needed in the Amazon to halt deforestation, repair
   agricultural damage, and restore forests to revive ecosystemic functions
   such as carbon (C) storage and soil health. A critical and demanding
   challenge, especially in sandy soils, is ceasing the slash-and-burn in
   smallholder farming livelihoods to preserve ecosystem services of
   primary and secondary forests. Here, we examined (i) the recovery of
   secondary forests in structure, litter layer, and soil health, as well
   as C storage post-agricultural abandonment of extremely sandy Amazonian
   soils (> 89 \% sand), and (ii) the extent of loss of these gains when a
   secondary forest is burned for agricultural reconversion. We tracked
   secondary forests at 2, 5, 10, and 20 years, including slash-and-burning
   the 20-year-old forest. Our methods included analyzing C stocks in soil,
   litter, and plants, forest vegetation ecological indexes, litter quality
   assessed through nitrogen (N), C, and lignocellulose contents, delta
   C-13 to indicate organic matter origin, and seven additional soil health
   indicators. Soil delta C-13 ranged from-27.1 to-28.8 parts per thousand
   across the sites, indicating a negligible influence of tropical grasses
   on the soil's organic matter and suggesting that pastures were not
   previously cultivated in these areas. Secondary forest growth
   accumulated 0.24 and 2.97 Mg C ha(- 1 )y(- 1 ) in litter and trees,
   respectively. Yet, soil C stocks did not show significant changes during
   20 years of forest regeneration. Over 18 years, the forest increased the
   vegetation diversity fourfold and litter N by 41 \%, improving forest
   structure and litter quality. This progress in organic matter
   aboveground contributed to improved soil biological activity and
   nutrient storage, facilitating soil health and multifunctionality
   regeneration as the forest aged. However, slash-and-burn resulted in a
   67.6 Mg C ha(- 1 ) loss, reverting levels below those of the 2-year-old
   forest. Returning to agriculture also depleted soil cation exchange
   capacity, bulk density, and fauna activity, degrading soil's chemical,
   physical, and biological functions to levels comparable to or worse than
   those in the youngest forest. We conclude that Amazonian lands abandoned
   after long-term agriculture still offer potential for ecological
   restoration, with secondary forests capable of regenerating multiple
   ecosystem functions, even in sandy soils. However, a single
   slash-and-burn reverses 20 years of progress and degrades soil health
   further. Recognizing smallholder farmers' poverty and reliance on
   slash-and-burn, we advocate for educational and socioeconomic support to
   stop fires and encourage sustainable agriculture, including bioeconomy
   incentives and environmental compensation to sustain the perpetuation
   and benefits of secondary forests in the Amazon.},

Abstract = {Amazon rainforest has been subjected to particularly high rates of
   deforestation caused mainly by the expansion of cattle pasture and
   agriculture. A commonly observed response to land-use change is a
   negative impact on biodiversity of plant and animal species. However,
   its effect on the soil microbial community and ecosystem functioning is
   still poorly understood. Here, we used a DNA metagenomic sequencing
   approach to investigate the impact of land-use change on soil microbial
   community composition and its potential functions in three land-use
   systems (primary forest, pasture and secondary forest) in the Amazon
   region. In general, the microbial community structure was influenced by
   changes in soil physicochemical properties. Aluminum and water-holding
   capacity significantly correlated to overall community structure and
   most of microbial phyla. Taxonomic changes were followed by potential
   functional changes in the soil microbial community, with pasture
   presenting the most distinct profile in comparison with other sites.
   Although taxonomic structure was very distinct among sites, we observed
   a recovery of the potential functions in secondary forest after pasture
   abandonment. Our findings elucidate a significant shift in belowground
   microbial taxonomic and potential functional diversity following natural
   forest re-establishment and have implications for ecological restoration
   programs in tropical and sub-tropical ecosystems.},

Journal = {FORESTS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {12},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {We analyze here how much carbon is being accumulated annually by
   secondary tropical dry forests (TDFs) and how structure, composition,
   time since abandonment, and climate can influence the dynamics of forest
   carbon accumulation. The study was carried out in Santa Rosa National
   Park in Guanacaste province, Costa Rica and Mata Seca State Park in
   Minas Gerais, Brazil. Total carbon storage and carbon accumulation were
   obtained for both sites from the sum of the aboveground carbon and
   belowground carbon gain plus the annual litterfall. Carbon accumulation
   of these TDFs varied from 2.6 Mg C ha(-1) y(-1) to 6.3 Mg C ha(-1)
   y(-1), depending on the age of the forest stands. Time since abandonment
   and number of stems per plot were the best predictors for carbon
   storage, annual carbon gains, and losses. Mortality rates and carbon
   losses were also associated with seasonal climate variability. We found
   significant correlations between tree mortality, carbon losses and mean
   seasonal temperature, mean seasonal precipitation, potential
   evapotranspiration, and the Oceanic Nino Index. Carbon dynamics in
   tropical dry forests are driven by time since abandonment and forest
   structure; however, rising temperature and El Nino Southern Oscillation
   (ENSO) events can have a significant impact on tree mortality and carbon
   losses. Depending on their location and land-use history, some dry
   forests are more impacted by climatic extremes than others, and
   differences between secondary stages are expected.},

Abstract = {The seeds in the soil play an important role in promoting the plant
   regeneration and acts on the local biodiversity conservation, but
   despite their importance, they are subject to biotic and abiotic factors
   that may inhibit their germination, including allelopathic effects
   triggered by the plants that are present in the soil environment. In
   this study we tested the hypothesis that the germination of seeds of
   seedbeds from Semidecidual Seasonal Forest (SSF) is inhibited under the
   canopy of exotic trees. Fifty (50) single samples of soil were collected
   (0.25 x 0.25 x 0.05 m) in a fragment of SSF; the samples were
   homogenized and from that new samples were taken and submitted to four
   (4) treatments: 10 samples were deposited in the greenhouse (SMN-CV);
   other 10 were returned to the forest fragment understory (SMN-MN); 10
   were deposited on the soil under homogeneous canopy of Pinus elliottii
   (SMN-P) and the last 10 samples were allocated under homogeneous
   plantation of Eucalyptus sp (SMN-E). We also collected samples of soil
   under the canopies of P. elliottii (SP-CV) and Eucalyptus sp.(SE-CV)
   that were transferred to a greenhouse. The number of seedlings was
   counted at intervals of 15 days in each seedbed sample and the plants
   obtained were identified when possible. We obtained 515 plants from 15
   botanical families, 21 genera and 13 morphospecies. The analysis of
   variance and comparison of means by Tukey-Kramer 0.01\% showed no
   statistical differences between the treatements. Outcomes indicate that
   the low density and diversity of plants in P. elliottii and Eucalyptus
   sp understory are not directly corelated to suppressive effects promoted
   by the presence of these species, supporting recent data from literature
   that stands out the forest plantations of exotic species as possible
   areas for biodiversity conservation, in opposition to the designation of
   ``green deserts{''} that are assigned to them.},

Abstract = {Purpose of review A rapidly changing climate is weakening the resilience
   of forest ecosystems through vitality loss of major native tree species,
   which reduces the ability of forests to deliver ecosystem services.
   Established invasive tree species (EITS) may take over the vacant space
   potentially preventing the regeneration of the preferred native tree
   species. This paper aims to investigate how expansion of these invasive
   non-native tree species can be addressed in a context of climate-smart
   forest management, considering alternatives to costly and often
   ineffective EITS control measures. Recent findings We found that forest
   ecologists increasingly recognize that climate-smart forest management,
   in particular tree species diversification and close-to-nature forest
   management, can strengthen the resilience of forests against negative
   impacts by EITS. In the resulting resilient forest ecosystems, a more
   closed canopy may deprive EITS of their invasive nature, and EITS may
   contribute to climate change adaptation. Summary This review proposes
   new pathways for forest management transcending the apparent
   incompatibility between the dominance of EITS and the adaptation
   capacity of forests and forest management to climate change. Adaptive
   measures to increase the resilience of forests to climate change may
   prevent the dominance of EITS. Under such conditions, useful functional
   traits of these tree species may even contribute to maintenance or
   enhancement of biodiversity, provisioning of ecosystem services and
   adaptation to climate change.},

Abstract = {Natural regeneration is one of the most appropriate techniques to
   promote the restoration of vegetation in degraded areas. Thus, this
   study aimed to evaluate the composition and the structure of the tree
   and regenerative strata in three areas under natural regeneration,
   characterized by different ages after the removal of stands of
   Eucalyptus grandis. The study area is located in the basin of Itajai
   river in Brusque, SC state. Data collection was performed with the
   deployment of 56 sample units (AU) of 200 m(2) distributed along the
   banks of a watercourse in areas that had five periods (AT I), three (AT
   II) and one and a half (AT III) years of abandonment. In each AU,
   individuals living with PAP >= 5 cm and height greater than 1.3 m were
   sampled. To survey the regenerative stratum, it was demarcated a subunit
   of 20 m(2) within each AU of tree communities where the plants were
   sampled with height <= 1,30 m. The studied vegetation presented
   distinctions in structural values, showing a succession dynamics during
   the study period. The pioneering suffered decrease in number of species,
   both in the tree layer as the regenerative, while shade-tolerant climax
   species had recruitments along with the advancement of the age of
   abandoned areas. The number of plants for ecological groups showed more
   pronounced changes in the regeneration layer with the increased
   abandonment period of areas and pioneer species decreased while the
   demanding climax light increased in density.},

Abstract = {The Brazilian wood industry is highly mobile. Over the past 20 years the
   eastern Amazon developed from a logging backwater to the principal
   hardwood processing center in Brazil. This occurred because of a decline
   in hardwood stocks in the south of Brazil coupled with the development
   of good transport. energy, and communications systems in eastern
   Amazonia.
   We studied the structure and economy of the wood industry along a 340 km
   stretch of the Belem-Brasilia Highway in eastern Amazonia. Of the 238
   sawmills present in this study region in late 1989. 79\% were installed
   in the 1980s. Ninety-seven percent of the mill owners came from outside
   Amazonia. Most (63\%) of the mill establishments were vertically
   integrated, engaging in both forest mill processing and forest logging.
   Logging establishments realize substantial profits. A typical sawmill
   with one band saw produces. on average, 4300 m3 of sawnwood year-1 from
   9200 m3 of roundwood. The value of this sawn production is estimated at
   \$670 800 or \$156 m-3. Production costs are \$116 m-3 giving an annual
   mill profit of \$170 000. For firms engaged in both logging and
   processing activities, annual profits were estimated at \$217 000
   (profit margin, 32\%) or \$900 ha-1 logged.
   An average of six trees were harvested per hectare in logging operations
   (n = 3 study areas) and the volume yield averaged 38 m3 ha-1. Damages to
   the forest during logging are significant. Twenty-seven trees greater
   than or equal to 10 cm dbh are severely damaged for each tree harvested.
   This damage occurs in the opening of approximately 40 m of logging road
   and 600 m2 of canopy per tree harvested. Vines are favored by these open
   conditions and forest fires are possible.
   Forest management is technically feasible but economically unattractive.
   Natural regeneration is abundant on logged sites: 4300 seedlings and
   saplings of economic species were registered per hectare. Stocking of
   larger trees of economic species with good form is also adequate: 16
   trees ha-1 greater than or equal to 30 cm dbh. This residual stock could
   be favored by vine cutting and refinement thinnings at an estimated cost
   of \$180 ha-1. Although these treatments result in increased growth
   rates. the projected return on management investments is low,
   Nonetheless, given the robust profits in the wood sector, profit margins
   would remain well above 20\% if management were mandated by law.
   At present the biggest impediment to forest management in the eastern
   Amazon is the undervaluing of the timber resource. Ranchers, who own
   most forest land. sell harvest rights to loggers at low prices -
   \%50-\%150 ha-1. After the logging teams extract the timber, these same
   ranchers are left with badly damaged forest tracts. With careful
   extraction and management procedures, harvests could be accomplished on
   a 30- to 40-year rotation and forest integrity could be maintained.
   Ranchers, insofar as they control the forest resource, have the power to
   guarantee its wise use. They could do this by supervising harvest
   operations on their lands to reduce damage and by raising the price of
   their timber and using this additional revenue to finance simple
   silvicultural operations.},

Abstract = {The availability and retention of phosphorus (P) in soils under recovery
   process after mining operations play an important role in the management
   of this nutrient. The objective of this study was to evaluate the P
   adsorption in a reconstituted soil as a function of two forest recovery
   processes after bauxite mining. We evaluated three systems: native
   forest (FOR), planting of forest seedlings after bauxite mining (TPL),
   and natural regeneration of vegetation after bauxite mining (NRV). In
   each system, eight sampling plots were deployed. In each plot, we
   collected litter and soil samples. The soil samples were collected at
   depths of 0-5, 5-10, 10-20, and 20-40 cm, for soil chemical analysis and
   adjustment of P adsorption isotherms. We also performed an inventory of
   the tree vegetation to obtain basal area (G) and species diversity (H
   `). Forest was significantly superior with respect to most soil
   fertility, litter, and vegetation attributes, followed by natural
   regeneration and planting. In general, the adsorption curves and maximum
   phosphorus adsorption capacity (MPAC) in soil followed the order
   planting > natural regeneration > forest. We observed a negative
   relationship between phosphorus adsorption and soil organic matter,
   potential acidity, and available phosphorus. This result highlights the
   importance of biomass conservation and maintenance to ensure phosphorus
   availability in reclamation practices. Furthermore, such results
   indicate that both soil cover and plant species diversity should be
   considered when selecting species to improve P availability for
   reclamation of mined areas.},

Abstract = {Mapping anthropogenic forest disturbances has largely been focused on
   distinct delineations of events of deforestation using optical satellite
   images. In the tropics, frequent cloud cover and the challenge of
   quantifying forest degradation remain problematic. In this study, we
   detect processes of deforestation, forest degradation and successional
   dynamics, using long-wavelength radar (L-band from ALOS PALSAR)
   backscatter. We present a detection algorithm that allows for repeated
   disturbances on the same land, and identifies areas with slow-and
   fast-recovering changes in backscatter in close spatial and temporal
   proximity. In the study area in Madre de Dios, Peru, 2.3\% of land was
   found to be disturbed over three years, with a false positive rate of
   0.3\% of area. A low, but significant, detection rate of degradation
   from sparse and small-scale selective logging was achieved. Disturbances
   were most common along the tri-national Interoceanic Highway, as well as
   in mining areas and areas under no land use allocation. A continuous
   spatial gradient of disturbance was observed, highlighting artefacts
   arising from imposing discrete boundaries on deforestation events. The
   magnitude of initial radar backscatter, and backscatter decrease,
   suggested that large-scale deforestation was likely in areas with
   initially low biomass, either naturally or since already under
   anthropogenic use. Further, backscatter increases following disturbance
   suggested that radar can be used to characterize successional
   disturbance dynamics, such as biomass accumulation in lands
   post-abandonment. The presented radar-based detection algorithm is
   spatially and temporally scalable, and can support monitoring
   degradation and deforestation in tropical rainforests with the use of
   products from ALOS-2 and the future SAOCOM and BIOMASS missions.},

Title = {Limited biomass recovery from gold mining in Amazonian forests},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {1. Gold mining has rapidly increased across the Amazon Basin in recent
   years, especially in the Guiana shield, where it is responsible for
   >90\% of total deforestation. However, the ability of forests to recover
   from gold mining activities remains largely unquantified.
   2. Forest inventory plots were installed on recently abandoned mines in
   two major mining regions in Guyana, and re-censused 18 months later, to
   provide the first ground-based quantification of gold mining impacts on
   Amazon forest biomass recovery.
   3. We found that woody biomass recovery rates on abandoned mining pits
   and tailing ponds are among the lowest ever recorded for tropical
   forests, with close to no woody biomass recovery after 3-4 years.
   4. On the overburden sites (i.e. areas not mined but where excavated
   soil is deposited), however, above-ground biomass recovery rates
   (0.4-5.4 Mg ha(-1) year(-1)) were within the range of those recorded in
   other secondary forests across the Neotropics following abandonment of
   pastures and agricultural lands.
   5. Our results suggest that forest recovery is more strongly limited by
   severe mining-induced depletion of soil nutrients, especially nitrogen,
   than by mercury contamination, due to slowing of growth in
   nutrient-stripped soils.
   6. We estimate that the slow recovery rates in mining pits and ponds
   currently reduce carbon sequestration across Amazonian secondary forests
   by similar to 21,000 t C/year, compared to the carbon that would have
   accumulated following more traditional land uses such as agriculture or
   pasture.
   7. Synthesis and applications. To achieve large-scale restoration
   targets, Guyana and other Amazonian countries will be challenged to
   remediate previously mined lands. The recovery process is highly
   dependent on nitrogen availability rather than mercury contamination,
   affecting woody biomass regrowth. The significant recovery in overburden
   zones indicates that one potential active remediation strategy to
   promote biomass recovery may be to backfill mining pits and ponds with
   excavated soil.},

Title = {Successional shifts in tree demographic strategies in wet and dry

Journal = {GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY},

Volume = {32},

Pages = {1002-1014},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Aim: Tropical forest succession and associated changes in community
   composition are driven by species demographic rates, but how demographic
   strategies shift during succession remains unclear. Our goal was to
   identify generalities in demographic trade-offs and successional shifts
   in demographic strategies across Neotropical forests that cover a large
   rainfall gradient and to test whether the current conceptual model of
   tropical forest succession applies to wet and dry forests.Location:
   Mexico and Central America.Time period: 1985-2018.Major taxa studied:
   Trees.Methods: We used repeated forest inventory data from two wet and
   two dry forests to quantify demographic rates of 781 tree species. For
   each forest, we explored the main demographic trade-offs and assigned
   tree species to five demographic groups by performing a weighted
   principal components analysis to account for differences in sample size.
   We aggregated the basal area and abundance across demographic groups to
   identify successional shifts in demographic strategies over the entire
   successional gradient from very young (<5 years) to old-growth
   forests.Results: Across all forests, we found two demographic
   trade-offs, namely the growth-survival trade-off and the
   stature-recruitment trade-off, enabling the data-driven assignment of
   species to five demographic strategies. Fast species dominated early in
   succession and were then replaced by long-lived pioneers in three
   forests. Intermediate and slow species increased in basal area over
   succession in all forests, but, in contrast to the current conceptual
   model, long-lived pioneers continued to dominate until the old-growth
   stage in all forests. The basal area of short-lived breeders was low
   across all successional stages.Main conclusions: The current conceptual
   model of Neotropical forest succession should be revised to incorporate
   the dominance of long-lived pioneers in late-successional and old-growth
   forests. Moreover, the definition of consistent demographic strategies
   that show clear dominance shifts across succession substantially
   improves the mechanistic understanding and predictability of Neotropical
   forest succession.},

Title = {MODELING DIAMETER DISTRIBUTION OF TREE SPECIES IN A SEMIDECIDUOUS FOREST
   FRAGMENT},
Journal = {REVISTA ARVORE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {47},
Abstract = {- Modeling diameter distribution in natural forests is an important tool
   for understanding the native woody species dynamics, supporting
   decision-making for degraded lands management and restoration.
   Therefore, this work aimed to fit probabilistic density functions to
   evaluate the diameter structure of three tree species with economic
   interest, such as Campomansesia xanthocarpa Marl. Ex. O. Berg,
   Piptadenia gonoacantha (Mart.) J.F. Macbr. and Zeyheria tuberculosa
   (Vell.) Bureau ex Verl., in a Semideciduous Seasonal Forest fragment at
   Sao Paulo State, Brazil. The data came from 83 temporary plots of 10 m x
   20 m systematically distributed along 164 ha. Log-normal, Gamma, and
   Weibull functions were fitted to the three species using the
   fitdistrplus-package in the R program. Kolmogorov-Smirnov's adherence
   test was used to evaluate the fits at a 5\% probability level. The
   functions were selected employing Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC)
   and Schwarz's Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), in addition to a
   graphical analysis of the fitted functions. The results indicated that
   the three species diameter structure is positively asymmetric,
   representing the exponential pattern, representing continuous natural
   regeneration. AIC and BIC statistics indicated the Log-normal function
   to describe the diameter distribution of C. xanthocarpa and Z.
   tuberculosa, while the Gamma function was the most appropriate for P.
   gonoacantha. For the three species, the graphical analysis showed the
   Gamma function results in the best fit without tendency for estimating
   frequency density per diameter class.},

Abstract = {Many harvested timber species of tropical forests have not been
   regenerating sufficiently and have thus made post-harvesting
   silvicultural treatments necessary. This study analysed the
   profitability of sawnwood produced through four treatments in seedlings
   and saplings naturally present or planted in logging gaps. The
   treatments were (1) standard procedures of reduced-impact logging or
   control, (2) tending of the naturally established regeneration, (3)
   enrichment planting 1 (EP-1) and (4) enrichment planting 2 (EP-2). In
   EP-1 seedlings were planted in 2-year-old gaps keeping logging residuals
   inside the gap while in EP-2 seedlings were planted in 1-year-old gaps
   with residuals removed. Species of EP-2 had higher financial value and
   growth rates than species in EP-1. Growth rates of treated individuals
   were projected in 30 and 60 years to simulate sawnwood production. With
   increases of 25 and 50\% in growth rates, 500\% in timber prices, and
   interest rates of 4 and 6\% year(-1), tending and enrichment planting
   could profit at year 60. These silvicultural treatments, with
   technological improvements, can become even more financially profitable
   for forest managers and investors.},

Abstract = {Forest restoration has never been higher on policymakers' agendas.
   Complex and multi-dimensional arrangements across the urban-rural
   continuum challenge restorationists and require integrative approaches
   to strengthen environmental protection and increase restoration
   outcomes. It remains unclear if urban and rural forest restoration are
   moving towards or away from each other in practice and research, and
   whether comparing research outcomes can help stakeholders to gain a
   clearer understanding of the interconnectedness between the two fields.
   This study aims to identify the challenges and opportunities for
   enhancing forest restoration in both urban and rural systems by
   reviewing the scientific evidence, engaging with key stakeholders and
   using an urban-rural forest restoration framework. Using the Society for
   Ecological Restoration's International Principles as discussion topics,
   we highlight aspects of convergence and divergence between the two
   fields to broaden our understanding of forest restoration and promote
   integrative management approaches to address future forest conditions.
   Our findings reveal that urban and rural forest restoration have
   convergent and divergent aspects. We emphasise the importance of
   tailoring goals and objectives to specific contexts and the need to
   design different institutions and incentives based on the social and
   ecological needs and goals of stakeholders in different regions.
   Additionally, we discuss the challenges of achieving high levels of
   ecological restoration and the need to go beyond traditional ecology to
   plan, implement, monitor, and adaptively manage restored forests. We
   suggest that rivers and watersheds could serve as a common ground
   linking rural and urban landscapes and that forest restoration could
   interact with other environmental protection measures. We note the
   potential for expanding the creative vision associated with increasing
   tree-containing environments in cities to generate more diverse and
   resilient forest restoration outcomes in rural settings. This study
   underscores the value of integrative management approaches in addressing
   future forest conditions across the urban-rural continuum. Our framework
   provides valuable insights for policymakers, researchers, and
   decision-makers to advance the field of forest restoration and address
   the challenges of restoration across the urban-rural continuum. The
   rural-urban interface serves as a convergence point for forest
   restoration, and both urban and rural fields can benefit from each
   other's expertise.},

Abstract = {Mimosa scabrella Benth., popularly known as ``bracatinga'', is a pioneer
   and endemic species of Brazil, occurring in Mixed Ombrophilous Forest
   associated with Brazilian Atlantic Rainforest biomes. It is a
   fast-growing tree of the Fabaceae family that facilitates the dynamics
   of ecological succession. SSR development, when there is no genome
   sequence, is time and labor intensive and there are no molecular markers
   for M. scabrella. We developed and validated the first microsatellite
   markers for this tetraploid species, evaluating mother trees and
   progenies. Using Illumina sequencing, we identified 290 SSR loci and 211
   primer pairs. After 31 SSR loci PCR/agarose electrophoresis selection, a
   subset of 11 primer pairs was synthetized with fluorescence in the
   forward primer for PCR and capillary electrophoresis validation with
   leaf DNA of 33 adult and 411 progeny individuals. Polymorphic locus
   percentage was 36, 4 in 11 loci, 3 chloroplast SSRs, and 1 nuclear SSR.
   Allele number of polymorphic loci ranged from 2 to 11 alleles
   considering all sampling. All 11 primer pairs were also tested for
   cross-species amplification for five Fabaceae-Mimosoideae species,
   ranging from 2 loci transferred to Calliandra tweedii Benth. and all 11
   loci transferred to Mimosa taimbensis Burkart. The assessed and
   validated SSR markers for M. scabrella are suitable and useful for
   analysis and population genetic studies.},

Abstract = {Survival and height growth rates of seedlings from natural regeneration
   of Manilkara huberi Chevalier (macaranduba) were evaluated during five
   years in clearings caused by logging in a managed natural forest in the
   municipality of Paragominas, Para State. Three sizes of canopy gaps were
   considered: small gaps (200-400 m(2)); medium-sized gaps (400-600 m(2));
   and large gaps (> 600 m(2)). 249 seedlings were monitored in 91 canopy
   clearings in four occasions in 2005, 2006, 2008 and 2010. From the 91
   canopy gaps, 39 were small gaps with 129 seedlings of M. huberi being
   monitored, 34 were medium-sized gaps with 78 seedlings and 18 were large
   gaps with 42 seedlings. On each occasion the height of each seedling was
   measured and the number of surviving seedlings was recorded. There was
   no significant difference in height growth rate of M. huberi seedlings
   between the different gap sizes, suggesting that the species, even being
   a shade-tolerant one, can survive and grow in sites with high solar
   radiation. But there was significant difference on growth rate of
   seedlings between the different periods. The seedlings grew faster in
   the second period, up to four years after logging, but grew slower in
   the last period, up to the sixth year after logging, because of the
   gradual canopy closing. The species had high survival rates during the
   study period even with the solar radiation increasing due to the canopy
   closing. Therefore natural regeneration from M. huberi performed well
   according to the changes that occurred in the forest ecosystem and can
   be assisted to grow from seedlings to potential crop trees.},

Abstract = {Studies of natural regeneration in logged forests indicate that without
   silvicultural intervention, succession in logging gaps may not result in
   establishment and recruitment rates adequate for sustained timber
   production from many tree species. I investigated the potential for
   management of timber tree species regeneration in disturbed areas within
   logged forest at a moist forest site in the eastern Amazon, through
   experimental introduction of seeds and seedlings of six timber species
   to logging gaps ranging in size from 165 to 455 m(2). I tested the
   effect of tending (removing competing vegetation) established seedlings
   in logging gaps at year I on seedling growth and survival over a 4-year
   period, and examined the influence of gap size on seedling development
   for each of the species. Seedling performance varied dramatically among
   logging gaps, related primarily to light conditions and competition.
   Tending was as important as gap size in determining sapling sizes at
   year 4 after planting. Projections based on species growth rates in
   logging gaps observed in this study suggest that individuals of all six
   species could recruit from seedling to minimum commercial size (50 cm
   dbh) within 60 years or less in logging gaps subjected to a regular
   thinning regime. Enrichment planting and tending of plants in logging
   gaps created in the first harvest could provide a substantial percentage
   of the timber volume in the third harvest, as well as serving to
   maintain viable populations of high-value timber species that appear
   unlikely to regenerate adequately in logged stands without direct
   interventions. However, low net present value of timber harvests
   projected for enrichment areas in year 60 relative to the upfront costs
   of this silvicultural treatment mean that widespread adoption of gap
   enrichment planting will likely only occur if financial incentives or
   new forest regulations are implemented. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {Restoration of the Brazilian savanna after pine silviculture: Pine
   clearcutting is effective but not enough},
Journal = {FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {491},
Month = {JUL 1},
Abstract = {Planting tree monocultures in Brazilian savannas is a common practice
   for wood production. However, afforestation and fire suppression have
   caused significant ecological changes and biodiversity loss in the
   Cerrado region. Restoring these modified systems to their pre-plantation
   states remains a considerable challenge. In this study, we compared the
   recovery of savanna vegetation after afforestation in areas managed with
   three restoration strategies: (i) old pine plantation stands that are
   not managed anymore (control), (ii) passive restoration (natural
   regeneration after pine clearcutting), and (iii) native tree planting
   (native tree seedlings planted at high density after pine clearcutting).
   To compare the outcome of each strategy to native ecosystems that were
   never plantations, we sampled a cerrado sensu stricto (the desired
   restoration target), and a cerradao (the local alternative state when
   savannas are fire-suppressed). Fifteen years after applying the
   restoration approaches, we assessed the structure, richness, and
   composition of the plant communities. For the analyses, we separated the
   upper layer (woody native species, diameter at breast height (DBH) >= 5
   cm) and ground layer (woody species with height >= 50 cm and DBH < 5 cm,
   and subshrubs and herbs), and distinguished savanna species from forest
   and generalist species. The results showed that both passive restoration
   and native tree planting restored the structure, richness, and
   composition of the upper layer, reaching the values of the cerrado sensu
   stricto. In contrast, in all treatments, the ground layer lacked the
   subshrubs and herbs typical of undisturbed savannas, with communities
   appearing similar to cerradao. Generalist species dominated all layers,
   and tree canopy cover in the treatments (mean values from 64.7\% to
   83.0\%) ranged from 2.4 to 3 times the cover value recorded in the
   cerrado sensu stricto (mean of 28\%). Pine clearcutting, independent of
   whether it was followed by native tree planting, improved the recovery
   of savanna woody vegetation. Therefore, we suggest that pine
   clearcutting, but not tree planting, is necessary to restore the woody
   community. Despite these apparently positive restoration outcomes for
   the woody plant community, it is important to note that after 15 years
   of passive restoration, communities are turning into low-diversity
   forests composed of generalist species and lacking savanna species in
   the ground-layer community. We therefore suggest that restoration of
   cerrado sensu stricto after pine clearcutting will require controlling
   woody encroachment, via prescribed fire or mechanical tree thinning, and
   planting of savanna subshrubs and herbs, rather than trees.},

Abstract = {The conversion of forests to agricultural crops impacts these
   ecosystems, causing negative changes in the biological, physical and
   chemical soil attributes. Agroforestry systems (AFs) represent an
   environmental sustainable alternative that can bind healthy food
   production and nature conservation. Litter production and decomposition
   are key roles to carbon and nutrient cycles in the tropics, as the main
   sources of nutrients for plant growing. The aim of this study was to
   quantify the amount of leaf litter accumulated aboveground and its
   contribution to nutrient return through decomposition process in 5- and
   10-year multistrata successional agroforestry systems (AF5 and AF10) as
   compared to 10-year natural regeneration areas (NR10) at Brazilian
   Atlantic Rainforest Biome. Greater amounts of standing litter were
   observed on AF5 (61 Mg ha(-1)) as compared to AF10 (45 Mg ha(-1)) and
   NR10 (39 Mg ha(-1)), with leaf contribution of 17\% (AF5), 25\% (NR10)
   and 30\% (AF10). Leaf decomposition was performed using litterbags, and
   all curves were fitted to a double exponential model for remaining mass,
   C and Mg and to a single exponential model for N, P, K and Ca. The
   half-time life of decomposing leaves varied from 173 days (NR10) to 289
   (AF5) and 301 days (AF10), and the half-time mineralization of nutrients
   varied from 15 (N on AF5) to 257 days (K on AF10). Despite their low
   contribution on total standing litter, leaf fraction is able to return
   at least 100 kg ha(-1) N, 5 kg ha(-1) P and 10 kg ha(-1) K to soil of
   multistrata agroforestry systems, reducing NPK external inputs
   dependence to small farmers.},

   of A. angustifolia occurring in the Forest Genetic Reserve of Cacador,
   located in the Brazilian state of Santa Catarina. The main goal of the
   present work was to describe the demographic structure of a natural A.
   angustifolia population. Therefore, the population studied was divided
   into four classes based on stage and gender: regeneration, juveniles,
   males and females. The diametric and height structures, sexual ratio,
   spatial and dependence patterns were evaluated. The results demonstrated
   that there was a small regeneration ratio and the sexual ratio was
   around 1:1, as previously expected for the species. In the spatial
   pattern analysis, aggregation groups appear in all classes studied. The
   regeneration showed clusters that do not seem to be associated to adult
   specimens. The natural regeneration occurs, but in low density under

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Throughout the Amazon of Brazil, manioc (Manihot esculenta) is a staple
   crop produced through slash-and-burn agriculture. Nutrient losses during
   slash-and-burn can be large and nutrient demand by food crops so great
   that fields are often abandoned after two years. In recent decades,
   farmers have reduced the fallow phase from 20 to similar to 5 years,
   limiting plant nutrient accumulation to sustain crop yields. Improved
   fallows through simultaneous planting of trees with food crops may
   accelerate nutrient re-accumulation. In addition, slash-and-mulch
   technology may prevent loss of nutrients due to burning and mulch
   decomposition may serve as a slow-release source of nutrients. This
   study in Para, Brazil, in a 7-year-old secondary forest following
   slashing and mulching of the vegetation, involved two main plot
   treatments (with and without P and K fertilizers) and two sub-plot
   treatments (with or without a N-2-fixer Inga edulis). A mixed-culture of
   trees and manioc was planted in all plots. P and K fertilizer increased
   tree mortality due to weed competition but growth of surviving trees in
   four of the five tree species tested also increased as did biomass
   production of manioc. In the N-2-fixer treatment trends of greater
   growth and survival of four of five tree species and manioc biomass were
   also observed. Fertilization increased the biomass of competing
   vegetation, but there was a fertilizer by N-2-fixer interaction as I.
   edulis caused a reduction in competing biomass in the fertilized
   treatment. After one year, fertilization increased decomposition of the
   mulch such that Ca, Mg, and N contents within the mulch all decreased.
   In contrast, P and K contents of mulch increased in all treatments. No
   influence of the N-2-fixer on 0-10 cm soil N contents was observed. Two
   years after establishment, this agroforestry system succeeded in growing
   a manioc crop and leaving a well-maintained tree fallow after the crop
   harvest.},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The stabling of livestock farming implies changes in both local
   ecosystems (regeneration of forest stands via reduced grazing) and those
   located thousands of kilometers away (deforestation to produce grain for
   feeding livestock). Despite their importance, these externalities are
   poorly known. Here we evaluated how the intensification and confinement
   of livestock in Spain has affected forest surface changes there and in
   South America, the largest provider of soybeans for animal feed to the
   European Union. For this purpose, we have used Spanish soybean import
   data from Brazil, Paraguay and Argentina and a land condition map of
   Spain. The area of secondary forest in Spain that has regenerated as a
   result of livestock stabling has been similar to 7000 kha for the decade
   2000-2010. In the same period, 1220 kha of high value South American
   ecosystems (e.g., Chaco dry Forest, Amazonian rainforest or Cerrado)
   have been deforested. While these figures may offer a favorable
   interpretation of the current industrial livestock production, it is not
   possible to speak of compensation when comparing the destruction of
   well-structured ecosystems, such as primary South American forests, with
   the creation of secondary forest landscapes in Spain, which are also
   prone to wildfires. Our results highlight how evaluating land use change
   policies at a national or regional level is an incomplete exercise in
   our highly telecoupled and globalized world.},

Title = {Effect of chemical and mechanical management of bamboo on seed rain in
   riparian areas},
Journal = {FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {508},
Month = {MAR 15},
Abstract = {Bamboo species are cultivated for different purposes around the world,
   mainly because they adapt easily to environmental changes. However,
   their aggressive growth strategies and competitive superiority make
   bamboos opportunistic, allowing for rapid colonization. The aim of this
   study was to evaluate the effect of bamboo management methods on the
   structure and composition of seed rain. We evaluated seed rain in
   riparian areas with and without bamboo dominance. In the area dominated
   by bamboo we evaluated: control (no interventions), chemical management,
   and mechanical management treatments. The area without bamboo dominance
   is a seasonal semi-deciduous forest remnant, considered a reference
   ecosystem. The control treatment showed a lower abundance of seed rain
   than the other treatments. The chemical treatment presented greater
   total abundance due to the overabundance of the morphospecies Mikania
   sp.; however, the species richness did not differ from the control
   treatment. Moreover, the chemical treatment showed low seed input with
   biotic dispersal, differing from the mechanical and reference
   treatments. Seed abundance for both dispersal mechanisms (biotic and
   abiotic) was similar between the mechanical and reference treatments. We
   concluded that the bamboo management methods favored the increase in
   seed rain. The bamboo mechanical management treatment facilitated seed
   dispersal and provided a significant increase in terms of richness and
   abundance in relation to the control treatment. Despite not showing a
   significant increase in richness, the chemical management treatment
   promoted a significant increase in seed abundance in relation to the
   control treatment.},

Abstract = {To mitigate the impacts of deforestation, Brazilian legislation requires
   the implementation of a Degraded Area Recovery Plan (PRAD). One way to
   assess the recovery of these areas is using bioindicators. This research
   tested the use of the drosophilid community structure as an indicator to
   evaluate post-mining area restoration. We compared two regeneration
   techniques within the same chronological sequence and as reference used
   the forest remnants within the exploration area. The study was conducted
   in the municipality of Paragominas-Para, in areas managed by Hydro
   mining company. Five sites of forest remnants were selected, five in
   natural regeneration and five in the nucleation technique, the latter
   two making up the PRADs. A total of 5,919 male drosophilids were
   collected belonging to 10 genera, and 32 species. Rarefaction showed the
   curves of the PRADs to be more asymptotic, than forested areas. Forest
   areas are potentially richer and, on average, have lower abundances and
   lower diversity. Beta diversity components in the forest present greater
   turnover and less nestedness processes when compared to PRADs areas. The
   PRADs showed no differences between them for any of the analyzed
   patterns. D. nasuta and D. sturtevanti behaved as generalists in
   relation to habitats, D. paulistorum and D. willistoni as forest
   specialists. D. malerkotliana, D. simulans, Scaptodrosophila
   latifasciaeformis, and Zaprionus indianus behaved as specialists in
   PRADs areas. The structure of the drosophilid community varied according
   to the environment, proving to be a good indicator for forest and
   regenerating environments, but it did not detect differences between the
   PRADs environments in early regeneration (6 years).},

Abstract = {The Atlantic tropical forest is highly fragmented and in strong
   regression. Next to these forests there are abandoned agricultural areas
   in which native vegetation is regenerating. The dynamics of that natural
   regeneration is poorly understood. The objective of the work was to
   define groups of tree species based on their regeneration pattern in
   these areas. To do that, the diameter distribution of the tree cover of
   an area in natural regeneration for 33 years in a Brazilian biological
   reserve was analyzed by species. 195 trees (813 trees ha(-1) 47.8 +/-
   95.6 trees per hectare) were inventoried on 2,400 m(2), belonging to 15
   families and 17 species, with a quadratic mean diameter of 13.7 cm and
   basal area averaging 11.9 m(2) ha(-1). Although 73 \% of the diameters
   ranged from 5 to 15 cm, the diameter distribution was satisfactorily
   fitted to the Gauss curve. Only five species presented more than 75
   trees ha(-1): Cecropia catarinensis, Miconia cinnamomifolia, and Miconia
   multiflora presented distribution with a tendency to normal, while
   Piptocarpha macropoda presented an inverted J shape; Vismia guianensis
   only appeared in the lowest diameter class. Integrating into a
   dendrogram the dispersion syndrome, ecological group, and wood density
   attributed to the sampled species, five functional groups were
   distinguished. Due to its homogeneity coefficient, the surveyed stand
   was classified as an uneven forest. Despite 33 years having elapsed
   since the start of the natural regeneration, the forest stand is still
   in an initial stage of its natural succession towards climax structures.},

Title = {Nutrient loss and redistribution after forest clearing on a highly

Journal = {ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS},
Year = {2004},
Volume = {14},
Number = {4, S},
Pages = {S177-S199},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Over the past three decades, tropical forest clearing and burning have
   greatly altered the Amazonian landscape by increasing the cover of
   pastures and secondary forests. The alteration of biogeochemical
   processes on these lands is of particular interest on highly weathered
   Oxisols that cover large areas in the region because of concerns
   regarding possible nutrient limitation in agricultural land uses and
   during forest regrowth. The objectives of this study were to quantify
   (1) the reaccumulation of nutrients in biomass of secondary land uses,
   (2) changes in soil nutrient contents, (3) internal nutrient cycles, and
   (4) input-output budgets for the landscape mosaic.
   Nutrient stocks and fluxes were quantified from 1996 to 1998 in mature
   forest, 19-yr-old secondary forest, degraded pastureland, and managed
   pastureland in the Brazilian state of Para. Mature forests contain 130
   Mg C/ha in aboveground biomass while secondary forest, degraded pasture,
   and managed pasture contain 34, 4, and 3 Mg C/ha, respectively.
   Reaccumulation of N, P, K, Ca, and Mg in aboveground biomass of
   secondary forest was 20\%, 21\%, 42\%, 50\%, and 27\% of that present in
   mature forest, while degraded pasture contained 2\%, 4\%, 15\%, 11\%,
   and 6\%. Managed pasture had similar accumulations as degraded pasture
   except for Ca (3\%).
   Changes in soil stocks of C, N, and P were not detected among land uses,
   except in fertilized managed pastures,, where total soil P (0-10 cm) was
   elevated. Conversely, Mehlich-III-extractable P of all secondary lands
   were very low (<1 mug/g) and were I kg/ha less than contents (0-10 cm)
   in mature forest. NaOH-extractable P was present in 100-fold higher
   concentrations and may gradually contribute to meeting plant demands
   over decadal time scales. Soil cation contents.(0-20 cm) were elevated
   in secondary lands with increases of similar to85, 500, and 75 kg/ha for
   K, Ca, and Mg respectively. These increases could account for a
   substantial portion of cation contents originally in the aboveground
   biomass of mature forest.
   The recycling of nutrients through similar to9.0 Mg(.)ha(-1.)yr(-1) of
   litterfall in secondary forest of 132, 2.8, 32, 106, and 23.
   kg(.)ha(-1.)yr(-1) for N, P, K, Ca, and Mg, respectively, is similar to
   mature forest. Nutrient returns in both pasturelands were smaller for
   all elements except K, which was similar to the forested sites. In these
   pasture ecosystems, grass turnover has rep laced litterfall return as
   the predominate mechanism of nutrient recycling.
   Soil solution fluxes of total N were higher in mature forest (12
   kg(.)ha(-1.)yr(-1) at 25 cm depth) compared to secondary lands (<4
   kg(.)ha(-1.)yr(-1)), indicating that cycling of available forms of N has
   diminished; Conversely, fluxes of cationic elements appear elevated in
   secondary lands and are charge balanced in solution by HCO3- derived
   from biological activity in the soil surface. Despite detectable
   increases in soil cation fluxes, rainwater inputs and stream water
   outputs of these elements across the watershed were not significantly
   different.
   The aggregate picture for this landscape is one in which the secondary
   forest, although still of smaller stature and lower in species diversity
   compared to mature forest, is recuperating important nutrient cycling
   functions. Conversely, pasturelands, which dominate the landscape, are
   not only of smaller stature, but are also accumulating and cycling a
   smaller total mass of nutrients. This ecosystem conversion has released
   C and N from biomass mostly to the atmosphere and has redistributed K,
   Ca, and Mg from biomass mostly to the soil. Presently, base cation
   enriched soils are slowly re-equilibrating to an acidic condition
   through decadal-scale processes of plant uptake and, biogenically driven
   soil leaching. Our mass balance approach has revealed low soil available
   N and P diminished rates of cycling of these elements in secondary
   lands, and low precipitation inputs of P, which may constrain long-term
   recuperation of ecosystem carbon.},

Title = {Predicting restored communities based on reference ecosystems using a
   trait-based approach},
Journal = {FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {391},
Pages = {176-183},
Month = {MAY 1},
Abstract = {Ecological restoration should focus, not only on species composition,
   but also on the ecological functions provided by the ecosystem,
   mirroring the characteristics found in the reference site. In this
   context, plant functional traits could help to achieve this goal, as
   they directly affect ecosystem processes. Thus, modeling species
   composition based on species functional traits could provide ways to
   make predictions about future communities and to assess the functioning
   of the ecosystem. In order to evaluate how different restored
   communities are from their reference ecosystem, we used a trait-based
   modeling approach that predicts relative abundances of a community based
   on the functional composition of the reference ecosystem. We surveyed
   adult trees in the canopy and seedlings in the understory in both
   reference and 10 year-old restoration sites in two different locations
   in South of Brazil to gather information of species composition and
   their relative abundances. Functional composition was based on
   information of leaf traits for all species included in the survey. We
   applied the model on two different components: canopy and understory
   species. We found differences in functional composition between the
   restored communities and the reference sites, indicating that the
   ten-year old restored forests are still not similar to the reference
   ecosystem. Both the observed and the predicted understory communities
   were more similar to the reference ecosystem than the observed canopy
   communities. It indicates that species that established after
   restoration interventions have functional composition closer to the
   reference ecosystem than the set of species initially selected for
   planting. Modeling the community based on functional trait composition
   coupled with long-term monitoring of sites undergoing restoration would
   enable a better evaluation of restoration trajectories and management
   needs to modify ecosystem functions towards values found in reference
   sites. Restoration should focus on the recovery of functional
   composition, which would provide a better set of resources for organisms
   and promote changes in ecosystem processes. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {Illegal deforestation in the amazon region has been growing a lot in
   recent years, the biggest and most worrying advances are within
   Conservation Units (CUs). This research aims to evaluate the efficiency
   of three Private Natural Heritage Reserve (RPPN) for the conservation of
   the forest cover. Therefore, for this research, three RPPNs (Seringal
   Assuncao, Vale das Antas and Agua Boa) were monitored using the
   supervised classification of images Landsat 5 and 8, corresponding to
   the years of creation of each RPPN and 2018. To perform the
   classification were collected similar to 60 pixels per area of interest
   (ROI), the classes selected were water, exposed soil and forest. After
   monitoring the three RPPNs, it was possible to observe an increase
   between 2\% up to 35\% of forest cover in the RPPNs. With the monitoring
   of the RPPNs using the images Landsat it was possible to detect the
   efficiency of the natural regeneration of the forest cover, as well as
   the preservation of the native vegetation. Therefore, it is possible to
   conclude that RPPNs are efficient to contain deforestation. However,
   further research is still needed in this area, since there are few
   researches on the monitoring of conservation units in Rondonia as well
   as in Brazil.},

Abstract = {Studies on the composition, richness and diversity of plant species in
   tropical communities are essential for understanding relevant ecological
   processes and for developing appropriate conservation policies.
   Considering that areas subject to direct impacts due to dam breach may

   composition was influenced by soil variables of three areas along the
   Gualaxo River, in Minas Gerais State, Brazil. In addition, we identified
   important plant species through occurrence and phytosociological
   parameters for ecological restoration projects in the affected region,
   serving as reference areas. We sampled plant species with DBH >= 5 cm
   (diameter at breast height - measured 1.30 m above ground level) in 77
   plots distributed in three riparian forest areas. We calculated
   phytosociological parameters and related them to edaphic factors. A
   total of 1579 individual plants belonging to 53 botanical families and
   227 species were sampled in the three areas. The Fabaceae family was the
   most representative with 46 species. Species composition and diversity
   among the sampled areas was similar and was associated with edaphic
   factors. Furthermore, some species (e.g. Xylopia sericea, Cupania
   emarginata and Ocotea pulchalla) showed an important relation with soil
   variables. Some species of the genera (e.g. Byrsonima, Xylopia, Ocotea
   and Croton) and families (e.g. Fabaceae and Myrtaceae) found here, can
   be important species in the restauration process for the local and

Abstract = {1. Leaf-cutting ants (LCAs) have often been denoted as ecosystem
   engineers because of their multifarious effects on the vegetation,
   particularly via nest-driven environmental changes. However, the
   non-trophic impacts of LCAs on forest dynamics via foliage harvesting
   across sizeable foraging zones (so-called associated ecosystem
   engineering) are still poorly investigated. 2. Here, light availability
   and sapling assemblages were assessed within foraging areas and ant-free
   control zones of 16 Atta cephalotes colonies located in a large remnant
   of Atlantic forest in northeastern Brazil. 3. Canopy openness and total
   light transmission were 1.4 and 1.6 times higher in foraging zones than
   in control areas. In parallel, sapling density and species richness
   decreased constantly from control to foraging zone plots. Additionally,
   shade-tolerant species exhibited reduced abundance across foraging
   zones. A non-metric multidimensional scaling ordination based on
   taxonomic similarity primarily segregated foraging zone and control
   plots; foraging zone plots converged to be more similar to each other as
   well. Finally, some plant species emerged as indicators of LCA-free
   zones. 4. These results suggest that LCA foraging activity in the forest
   canopy directly increases the light availability and indirectly affects
   the recruitment and the structure of local plant assemblages. 5. Such a
   biologically significant effect on the light environment and its
   cascades confirms LCAs as potent ecosystem engineers, particularly as a
   plant assembly force, which operates beyond the spatial reach of their
   well-described nest effects.},

Abstract = {The olfactory capacity in bats and their strong preference for some

   certain amount of time flying around these new food sources. This
   technique has great potential for natural methods of regeneration
   assisted by dispersers, increasing arrival of chiropterochoric seeds in
   areas that otherwise may not be frequently visited by frugivorous bats.
   Although we developed this technique on Neotropical species, we believe
   it has the potential to be used around the world to recover degraded
   forests. Here, we explore parallels between New (Phyllostomidae) and Old
   World (Ptempodidae) seed dispersing bats to support this proposal.
   Review data showed that Cynopterus, Pteropus, and Rousettus seem to be
   the closest functional genera to those (Artibeus, Carollia, Sturnira)
   tested in the Neotropical region, based on their wide distribution, diet
   diversity and great consumption of Ficus - whose oils are known to
   attract fruit bats. Experiments need to be designed to further develop
   the technique to apply it to the Old World and contribute to the
   restoration of degraded forests.},

Abstract = {The objective of this study was to determine the structure and
   composition of an Atlantic Rain Forest tract with a land use history of
   banana plantation 50 year ago and evaluate the factors that influence
   its regeneration. Individual trees and shrubs with diameter at breast
   height (dbh) >= 5 cm were sampled within 25 plots of 10 x 10 m for a
   total sample size of 0.25 ha. We found 311 stems distributed across 92
   species, 67 genera and 31 families, with a basal area of 34.18 m(2)/ha
   and a density of 1,244 ind./ha. The ten species with the highest
   importance value(IV) were the following: Aiouea saligna Meisn.,
   Tachigali paratyensis(Vell.)H.C. Lima, Ficus insipida Willd., Bathysa
   gymonocarpa K. Schum, Chrysophyllum flexuosum Mart., Piptadenia
   gonoacantha (Mart.)J.F. Macbr., Piper rivinoides Kunth., Hyeronima
   alchorneoides Allemao, Miconia cinnamomifolia ( DC.) Naudin and Guarea
   guidonia (L.) Sleumer The high Shannon richness index and Pielou index
   (H'=4.13 nats/ind. and J'=0.91), are close to those of preserved forest
   stands of AtlanticRain Forest, suggesting a good recovery process for
   this stand, representing an intermediary stage of successional dynamics.
   The abandonment of the banana plantation created an environment of
   heterogeneous light conditions, allowing for the entry of species with
   different establishment strategies. The presence of a remnant tree of
   the Ficus genus, is related to a popular belief that ended up
   influencing the vegetation structure. Thus, the species sampled in this
   study reflected the past land use and the local culture.},

   successional changes of dung beetle community, with species composition,

   successional stages in both wet and dry seasons. We sampled a total of
   2,752 individuals, representing 38 beetle species and 14 genera. The
   composition, richness, and abundance of dung beetles changed along the
   successional gradient and was strongly related to seasonal variation.
   The highest diversity of dung beetles was found in the intermediate aged
   forest fragments. These findings highlight the importance of secondary

Abstract = {The effects of herbivory by the leaf-cutting ant Atta laevigata Fr.
   Smith on the reestablishment of forest trees in an abandoned farm near
   Manaus, central Amazonia, were investigated. Experimental seedling
   transplants and observations on seedlings which emerged naturally in the
   study area showed that damage by leaf-cutting ants negatively affected
   tree seedling survival and growth. However, excluding leaf-cutting ants
   from experimental plots for 20 mo did not significantly increase tree
   seedling densities. The number of seedlings emerging varied considerably
   between plots and this obscured any effect the ants may have had on
   seedling survivorship. Taller seedlings, and seedlings attacked only
   once, suffered less mortality than smaller seedlings and seedlings
   attacked twice or more. In general, mortality was greater for those
   species preferred by the ants, indicating that selective herbivory by
   leaf-cutting ants affects tree species composition. The number of
   seedlings attacked by A. laevigata remained approximately constant
   throughout the period of this study in spite of the fact that the number
   available for attack increased. Thus, the chance of any individual
   seedling being attacked declined with time, suggesting that the effect
   of Atta herbivory on tree establishment is stronger during the first few
   years of forest regeneration.},

Journal = {FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {501},
Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {The Caatinga is a tropical dry forest. Rational exploitation of Caatinga
   wood resources consists of sustainable forest management under coppice
   systems. Therefore, the recovery of the timber stock for the next cycle
   will depend on the regrowth and survival capacity of the exploited
   species, as well as on the future structure of the forest. The objective
   of this work was to characterize the survival, structure, and diversity
   of Caatinga submitted to coppicing under sustainable forest management
   comparing pre-and post-harvest conditions. Permanent plots were
   installed in a Caatinga in the municipality of Floresta-PE, Brazil, in
   2013, and measured 2 years after clearcutting. Height and circumference
   at the base (CAB) of the stumps and shoots were obtained for two
   sit-uations: pre-cut (grouping by live and dead stumps) and (ii)
   post-cut (shoots on only live stumps). In addition, all individual
   shrub-tree species (CAB >= 4 cm) not included in the post-cut situation
   were identified, measured (CAB and height total) and tagged as
   persisting (6 cm < CAB) or growing (6 < CAB <= 4 cm) in 2015. The
   survival and mortality of the stumps were quantified, as well as changes
   in the horizontal structure and floristic diversity. There was a
   decrease in the number of species 2 years after cutting, mainly due to
   the loss of Croton rhamnifolius H. B. K. and Sapium glandulatum (Vell.)
   Pax and predominance of Cenostigma bracteosum (Tul.) E. Gagnon \& G. P.
   Lewis, Aspidosperma pyrifolium Mart., and Cnidoscolus quercifolius
   Pohl., resulting in a greater number of in-dividuals of a few species.
   The outstanding regrowth capacity of these three species indicates that
   the forest remnant under study may eventually consist of populations
   with a predominance of species capable of coppicing.},

Journal = {FOREST SCIENCE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {70},

Pages = {397-404},
Month = {AUG 21},
Abstract = {Tropical timber species are generally shade tolerant, but preliminary
   studies have indicated that greater light availability can accelerate
   their growth. In this study, we hypothesized that native timber species
   can grow faster initially when planted in full sun alongside the pioneer
   species in high-diversity restoration plantings compared with being
   planted in the understory of an established forest restoration. We
   assessed the mortality, relative growth in height (RGH) and stem
   diameter (RGDGL) of eight native timber species from the Brazilian
   Atlantic Forest 19 months after planting. Overall seedling mortality was
   similar across planting conditions, and only Handroanthus heptaphyllus
   exhibited higher mortality in the shaded planting. The RGH and RGDGL of
   most species was higher in full sun planting. Therefore, our findings
   indicate that those tropical timber species grow faster and have higher
   survival rates when planted in open areas.Study Implications: We
   evaluated the initial growth and mortality of eight timber species
   native to the Atlantic Forest, focusing on their performance in forest
   restoration across two distinct conditions: full sun alongside pioneer
   species, and natural shade beneath an established canopy. Late
   successional timber species exhibit accelerated initial growth rates
   when planted in full sunlight compared with under an established forest
   canopy due to the greater light intensity. Our findings strongly support
   the practice of planting native timber species in full sun alongside
   pioneer species. This approach also provides logistical advantages,
   potentially reducing costs compared with staggered planting methods.},

Title = {Forest Degradation Associated with Logging Frontier Expansion in the
   Amazon: The BR-163 Region in Southwestern Para, Brazil},
Journal = {EARTH INTERACTIONS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {20},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Forest degradation is the long-term and gradual reduction of canopy
   cover due to forest fire and unsustainable logging. A critical
   consequence of this process is increased atmospheric carbon emissions.
   Although this issue is gaining attention, forest degradation in the
   Brazilian Amazon has not yet been properly addressed. The claim here is
   that this process is not constant throughout Amazonia and varies
   according to colonization frontiers. Moreover, the accurate
   characterization of degradation requires lengthy observation periods to
   track gradual forest changes. The forest degradation process, the
   associated timeframe, spatial patterns, trajectories, and extent were
   characterized in the context of the Amazon frontiers of the 1990s using
   28 years (1984-2011) of annual Landsat images. Given the large database
   and the characteristic of logging and burning, this study used data
   mining techniques and cell approach classification to analyze the
   spatial patterns and to construct associated trajectories.
   Multi-temporal analysis indicated that forest degradation in the last
   two decades has caused as many interannual landscape changes as have
   clear-cuts. In addition, selective logging, as a major aspect of forest
   degradation, affected a larger amount of forest land than did forest
   fire. Although a large proportion of logged forest was deforested in the
   following years, selective logging did not always precede complete
   deforestation. Instead, the results indicate that logged forests were
   abandoned for approximately 4 years before clearance. Throughout the
   forest degradation process, there were no recurrent forest fires, and
   loggers did not revisit the forest. Forest degradation mostly occurred
   as a result of a single selective logging event and was associated with
   low-intensity forest damage.},

Abstract = {To estimate the risk of population decline for the threatened palm
   species Butia eriospatha, we investigated the patterns of demography,
   natural regeneration, herbivory, and the levels of genetic diversity
   using 9 microsatellite loci from both adults and seedlings sampled from
   4 populations in Southern Brazil (n 330). Our results indicate that
   cattle grazing in B. eriospatha population areas severely affect their
   demographic structure. Three B. eriospatha populations showed a bimodal
   age structure made up of adult plants and seedlings and high rates (>
   77\%) of livestock herbivory. For 1 population, we describe and quantify
   for the first time the occurrence of 6 ontogenetic stages for this
   threatened palm species. Populations of B. eriospatha showed high levels
   of genetic differentiation (F-ST adult plants 0.287, F-ST seedlings
   0.175). The amount of observed heterozygosity differed significantly
   between small (H-O 0.329) and large populations (H-O 0.461), indicating
   that small populations can be more susceptible to genetic drift. With no
   recruitment and a mortality rate of 2.0\%, we show that the populations
   investigated in this study would be at an extremely high risk of local
   extinction, with a greater than 50\% reduction in the effective
   population size, in the next 40 years. Although this study highlights
   the importance of analyzing both population ecology parameters and
   genetic data to better understand the level of risk facing threatened
   species, we emphasize that policy actions are urgently needed for
   effective conservation of this vulnerable biological resource.},

   the Araucaria Forest Secondary Succession (AFSS) and the second one an
   Araucaria Forest in silvipastoral System (AFSP), correlated with the
   floristic and the biomass dynamics from 2013 to 2016, in the

   plots, 1.8 hectares in area with AFSP and 1.68 hectares in AFSS area,
   subdivided into contiguous subplots of 100 m(2) in each area. The
   estimated biomass was calculated by stratification of the compartments
   (bole, bark, branches and foliage), using DBH (Diameter at Breast
   Height) data. The areas covered 32 botanical families, 56 genera and 76
   species. As regards total biomass, it was found that AFSS was higher
   than that found in the AFSP, being 273.64 and 292.61 Mg.ha(-1) for FOMS
   and 174.67 and 189.76 Mg.ha(-1) for the FOMSP in the years of 2013 and
   2016, generating an increment of 5.99 Mg.ha(-1).year(-1) in the AFSS and
   5.03 Mg.ha(-1).year(-1) in the AFSP. Therefore, it can be concluded that
   the evaluated fragments show low growth in the dominance of some species

   Amazon, Brazil, under three different restoration methods: Nucleation
   (NC), Seedling planting (SP), and induction of natural regeneration (NR)
   in comparison with a reference forest (RF). Structural and compositional
   indicators, including density, frequency, and dominance, as well as the
   Importance Value Index (IVI) of tree species, mortality, conservation
   status, diversity indices, and Mean Annual Increase in height and
   diameter (MAIH and MAIDBH) were assessed. Solanum crinitum, Cecropia
   distachya, Senegalia polyphylla, and Qualea grandiflora were the most
   important species according to IVI for SP, NR, NC, and RF, respectively.
   In SP, MAIH and MAIDBH were higher than in the other treatments,
   however, the difference between methods was not of significant. The
   diversity indices of the three restoration methods tested were close to
   those of RF. Four species with some conservation status were identified;
   Cedrela odorata, Genipa americana, Swietenia macrophylla, and Hymenaea
   parvifolia, all native to the eastern Amazon. Thus, through the
   indicators, we found that all restoration methods showed positive
   indicators of restoration and a gradual return of the structural
   characteristics of the vegetation.},

Abstract = {The anthropic exploration of native areas and the introduction of exotic
   species resulted in the process of biological contamination, responsible
   for environmental and economical damages. Biological invasions are
   considered the second worst threat to biodiversity. This work had the
   objective of identifying the infestation index of the invader exotic
   species Tecoma stans. It is aggressive and hard to control and spreads
   easily by winged seeds and vegetative structures. The work was carried
   out in the county of Bandeirantes - PR, and the T. stans infestations
   patches were identified by GPS after field visits. The informations were
   processed in the Georeferenced Information Processing System - SPRING
   4.1. There were identified 72 patches, predominantly in the pastures
   areas, river adjacent forests and forest fragments borders. Among the 16
   microbasins of the county, infestation patches were identified in 10.
   There were 20, 17, 11, 7 and 7 patches with higher incidence, in Agua do
   Cateto, Agua da Cabiuna, Ribeirao dos Indios, Agua das Perobas and Agua
   das Antas, respectively. The analysis of spatial distribution revealed
   that the patches present the tendency to group up to 2.000 in away. The
   actual situation found in the analyzed areas is concerning, due to the
   high levels of T. stans infestations. The species is present in many of
   the neglect areas and puts in risk the forest remainders close to these
   areas.},

Title = {Seizing resilience windows to foster passive recovery in the

Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {828},
Month = {JUL 1},
Abstract = {Forest regeneration has increased in many tropical abandoned lands and
   current restoration commitments in this region aim to restore over
   1,400,000 km(2) of degraded land by 2030. Although regenerating forests
   recover biomass, biodiversity, and processes with time, the recovery
   trajectories may be uncertain due to past disturbances. Currently, there
   is a lack of knowledge to sustain the effectiveness of passive
   regeneration for the recovery of riparian forests and the adjacent
   waterbodies in the tropics, which may compromise the outcomes of ongoing
   and future tropical riparian restoration programs. We evaluated the
   drivers of riparian forest structural recovery and how this relates to
   stream conditions in 12 abandoned pasturelands in eastern Brazilian
   Amazonia. These pasturelands range across regeneration age (pasture (PA)
   - 0 to 4 years; young regeneration (YR) - 8 to 12 years; old
   regeneration (OR) -18 to 22 years) and years of past land-use (PA -
   23.25 average years of past land-use, YR - 18.25, OR - 7). We compared
   the conditions of these sites to 4 reference sites with conserved
   forests (REF, >100 years), where there was no recorded pasture use in
   the past. Short-term responses of forests and streams to passive
   regeneration indicated high ecosystem resilience after low to
   intermediate past land-use intensity, reflected in the improvement of
   stream ecosystems. Such high resilience is possibly attributable to low-
   to intermediate-intensity pasture-related disturbances, remaining forest
   matrix, and residual structures (e.g. roots, sprouts, and in-stream
   wood) observed in the area. Our results suggest a recovery by 12 to 20
   years for riparian forests of this region. However, areas degraded by
   intensive land-use apparently showed delayed recovery. We conclude that
   seizing resilience windows (defined here as the period when ecosystems
   retain high potential resilience is essential to foster passive recovery
   of riparian forests and streams more cost-effectively in the tropics.},

Abstract = {The capacity to capture carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere is one
   of several ecosystem services offered by forests and the species Hevea
   guianensis Aubl. stands out as a potential CO2 sink. This study aimed to
   estimate the carbon credit potential in the wood of rubber trees in
   abandoned plantings in Tapajos National Forest. In the years 2013 and
   2018, 100 \% inventories were carried out, in which the circumference
   and height of the trees were registered. The fixed carbon (MgC ha(-1)),
   the equivalent carbon (CO2(eq) ha(-1)) was calculated and converted into
   credits per hectare (US\$ ha-1) from the European System for the CO2. In
   2013, 2,965 rubber trees were registered, and in 2018, 2,927 were
   inventoried. Despite the death of some trees in the range of 5 years, it
   was estimated a total of 72.3103 MgC ha(-1) in 2013, and 73.3708 MgC
   ha(-1) in 2018, resulting in a current annual increase of 0.2121 MgC
   ha(-1), reducing 0.7777 CO2(eq) ha(-1) ano(-1), which would make
   possible an annual revenue of US\$ 515.90. Thus, it was concluded that
   the potential for generating carbon credits identified in the rubber
   plantations could add value to the forest, resulting in an addition to
   the income of the traditional population, making it a differential for
   the conservation of the Conservation Unit.},

Abstract = {The survival of forest communities is based on the seedling bank, since
   the greater the diversity, the greater the probability of heterospecific
   replacements. This work aimed to verify, through the species
   composition, if there is natural regeneration of the clearing with and
   without management and if it is possible that the clearing regeneration
   occurs without the management. The study site covered a clearing and a
   fragment of the Atlantic Forest Biome, in the municipality of Sao
   Sebastiao/SP, north coast of the state of Sao Paulo. Ten subplots of 0.5
   m x 1.0 m were installed randomly in 8 transects of 2.0 m x 50.0 m, with
   and without seedling management, where the set of seedlings with up to
   20 cm was sampled. At the end of the study, 266 individuals were found,
   grouped into 38 families and 5 life forms (arboreal, shrub, herbaceous,
   epiphyte and liana), later classified into: 45 species (60.81\%), 23
   genera (31.08\%) and 6 families (8.10\%). Myrtaceae and Rubiaceae stood
   out as the most species-rich families, with 8 and 6 species,
   respectively. In the clearing, 22.2\% of the sampled species were found,
   while 77.8\% belonged to the forest. The difference between the number
   of species in the clearing and in the forest fragment suggests that the
   invasive species Melinis minutiflora and Scleria plusiophylla can hinder
   the establishment of seeds, preventing the germination of native
   species. Therefore, for the clearing regeneration process to occur
   faster, human intervention is necessary in the management of invasive
   species. Accordingly, the elaboration of a revegetation project with
   monitoring and evaluation of the area of study was emphasized.},

Abstract = {The objective of this study was to select and discuss indices to explain
   competition among trees in an unmanaged stand in order to support
   decision-making in forest management. The work was carried out in a
   plantation of Araucaria angustifolia (Bertol.) Kuntze located in a
   national forest in southern Brazil. The plantation was established in
   1946 in 2 x 2 m spacing, with only one thinning that happened sometime
   between 1970 and 1980. Forty-six sample plots were established using an
   adaptation of the Prodan method. We tested distance-independent and
   distance-dependent competition indices that included or excluded crown
   area variables. An equation was generated to describe the relation
   between diameter at breast height and crown diameter, since these were
   highly correlated (r = 0.87); this permitted calculation of the growth
   space required for the trees in the stand. It is important to carefully
   choose the variables and competition indices to be tested in each study
   case. Including crown variables did not improve prediction ability to
   overcome the performance of the Stage distance-independent index. In
   general, the distance-independent indices performed better than the
   distance-dependent ones, even the stand arrangement in our study area
   was modified through thinning, mortality, and natural regeneration. When
   the goal is to better understand the ecological significance of a
   competition index and not only its statistical ability to predict
   short-term growth, simpler indices are recommended.},

Abstract = {Past human modification of forests has been documented in central,
   southwestern, and eastern Amazonia, especially near large rivers.
   Northwestern Amazonia, and interfluvial forests there in particular, are
   assumed to exhibit little past human impact. We analyzed soils and
   floristic structure and composition of interfluvial forests located in
   the Icana River basin, northwestern Amazonia, to assess their degree of
   past human modification. Ancient Baniwa village sites, abandoned
   centuries ago, have given rise to ``ancestral forests{''} with as much
   as 57\% of all trees/palms belonging to a group of species managed
   currently by the Baniwa, compared to only 10\% of such species in
   old-growth forests that are not remembered as having been inhabited or
   managed in Baniwa oral tradition. Participatory mapping and direct
   observations revealed ancestral forests to be widely distributed
   throughout the region, whereas old-growth forests are rare. Managed
   species in ancestral forests contributed 5-fold more to total tree/palm
   biomass than in old-growth forests. Human management has produced
   lasting changes in floristic composition, maintained total tree/palm
   biomass, and improved soil quality. This is the first study to
   demonstrate past human modification in Amazonian interfluvial forests,
   while explicitly isolating historical human management from edaphic
   effects on floristic structure and composition. Despite environmental
   limitations on human population size, posed by nutrient-poor black water
   rivers and acidic, sandy soils, indigenous peoples of northwestern
   Amazonia left a clear, lasting cultural legacy in ancestral forests.
   Given legal changes that threaten indigenous peoples' land rights
   currently under debate in Brazil, we call for a reconsideration of
   biodiversity conservation policies and indigenous rights in areas that
   show enduring legacies of management by indigenous populations.},

Abstract = {Sandy coastal plant communities in tropical regions have been
   historically under strong anthropic pressure. In Brazil, these systems
   shelter communities with highly plastic plant species. However, the
   potential of these systems to regenerate without human assistance after
   disturbances has hardly been examined. We determined the natural
   regeneration of a coastal sandy plain vegetation (restinga) in Brazil,
   16years after the end of sand removal. We inventoried 38 plots: 20
   within a sand-mined site and 18 in an adjacent undisturbed site. We
   expected lower diversity values in the sand-mined site compared to the
   undisturbed site, but similar species composition between the two sites
   due to the spatial proximity of the two sites and the high plasticity of
   restinga species. Species were ranked using abundance and importance
   value index in both sites, and comparisons were performed using Renyi
   entropy profiles, rarefaction curves, principal component analysis, and
   redundancy analysis. Species composition and dominant species differed
   markedly between the two sites. Bromeliads and Clusia hilariana,
   well-known nurse plants, dominated the undisturbed site but were almost
   absent in the regenerating site. Species richness did not differ between
   both sites, but diversity was higher in the undisturbed site.
   Within-site composition differences in the mined area were associated
   with field characteristics. Interestingly, species classified as
   subordinate or rare in the undisturbed site became dominants in the
   regenerating site. These newer dominants in the sand-mined site are not
   those known as nurse plants in other restingas, thus yielding strong
   implications for restoration.},

Abstract = {Studies measuring the damage in degraded environments have increased,

   indicators for the recovery of such degraded environments and subsequent
   preservation. This study aimed to conduct a survey of local insects and
   evaluate their utility in monitoring forest restoration in a degraded
   area in the Atlantic Forest biome in Ribeirao Grande, State of So Paulo,
   Brazil. Collections with Shuey traps were conducted from 2006 to 2011 in
   four distinct forest fragments characterized by environmental impacts,
   human actions, and phytophysiognomic profiles: Forest (FO), a preserved
   area with native plant species; ``Capoeira{''} (CA), an area in the
   natural regeneration process; Planting (PL), an area reforested with
   native plants; and Pasture (PA), an area with only shrubs. A total of
   2,456 specimens of Calliphoridae (Diptera) were collected. Mesembrinella
   bellardiana was the most abundant (n = 1,884) and dominant species in
   all environments sampled. The relative abundance of M. bellardiana in
   the most preserved environment (60.2 \% FO, 24.4 \% CA, 8.6 \% PL, and
   6.7 \% PA) and other ecological parameters showed that it could be a
   bioindicator species, i.e., data on its presence or absence directly
   reflected the status of local preservation. Information on Neotropical
   dipterans associated with the forested environment is very scarce in the
   literature. To our knowledge, this is the first study describing the
   occurrence of Calliphora lopesi (Calliphoridae) in the State of So

Abstract = {The inventory diversity of Coleoptera (Insecta) of an anthropized
   landscape in the Biome Araucaria. The species richness, taxonomic
   composition, rare species, and taxonomic constancy at family level were
   studied in communities of Coleoptera in Vila Velha, Ponta Grossa,
   Parana, as part of PROVIVE project. The data were gathered through
   malaise traps in the understory stratum of five sites with different
   floristic conditions product of anthropogenic effects, from
   Septernber/1999 to August/2000. The 52 weeks sampling in the five sites
   produced 10,822 specimens of 1,659 species. All areas present high
   species richness and high diversity as indicated by various indices. The
   area in advanced condition of vegetation succession was less rich than
   ones in early/middle stage. According to different species richness
   estimators, the number of observed species could be increased by
   22-123\% if more time colleting effort had been made. The early
   successional stage areas were richer in rare species (singletons,
   doubletons and uniques) than the more preserved ones. In the five areas
   there were a taxonomic constancy among the richest families
   (Curculionidae, Chrysomelidae, Cerambycidae, Staphylinidae, Mordelidae,
   Elateridae, Scarabaeidae, Coccinellidae and Tenebrionidae) involving
   60\% of the total species as observed with the specimens abundance. If
   the existence of this pattern is confirmed, it will be easier and faster
   to study Coleoptera communities and soon apply this order as a forest
   environmental indicator taxon.},

Title = {Age and light effects on seedling growth in two alternative secondary
   successions in central Amazonia},
Journal = {PLANT ECOLOGY \& DIVERSITY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {7},
Number = {1-2, SI},
Pages = {349-358},
Abstract = {Background: In central Amazonia, previous low intensity land use
   engenders succession dominated by Cecropia spp. which proceeds at high
   rates; however, at higher intensity of use succession is arrested and
   dominated by Vismia spp. over the long-term. Factors driving these two
   successional pathways are unknown.
   Aims: We aimed to elucidate seedling growth under the two alternative
   successional pathways.
   Methods: We experimentally determined the effects of successional age
   and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) on relative height growth
   (RHG) of nine species of shade-tolerant tree seedlings in secondary
   forests dominated by Cecropia and Vismia, varying in age from 1-20
   years.
   Results: In Cecropia-dominated successions, seedling RHG decreased with
   increasing successional age and with associated decreasing PAR. In
   Vismia-dominated successions, RHG was independent of successional age
   and PAR, and PAR did not change with successional age, being always
   higher than in Cecropia stands. The RHG of seedlings was lower in
   Vismia-than in Cecropia-dominated stands for similar PAR levels.
   Conclusions: Successional age and light availability affect seedlings
   growth differently in the two successional pathways. Unlike in
   Cecropia-dominated successions, in Vismia-dominated secondary forests
   seedling growth is limited by factors other than light. In a scenario of
   increasing land use intensity, constraints to seedling development in
   secondary forests can reduce species diversity in human-altered
   landscapes.},

   techniques, in terms of phytosociological and edaphic responses, that

   for cellulose production as well as set aside for environmental
   conservation, four stands were analysed: three of them were considered
   degraded and were managed using different intervention techniques
   (transposition, perch, and abandonment), and a fourth stand comprising
   pristine vegetation was considered a control (reference). Floristic and
   phytosociology data were collected in three 10x10m plots established in
   each stand. Also, a total of 48 soil samples were collected to analyse
   physical and chemical attributes of the topsoil for the different
   stands. In terms of biodiversity, all the treatments showed
   significantly lower values when compared to the reference area. However,
   the soils in all the treatment and reference stands are similar in terms
   of physical and chemical attributes. Taking into account the
   specificities of each restoration technique, we verified that the
   integrated use of a set of management practices, constituted by the (1)
   abandonment of the area and (2) following a selective killing of the

Abstract = {The Semiarid region in the Northeast of Brazil is characterized by
   Caatinga tropical forests, adapted to 8 -to -9 months of annual water
   stress. Human activities have resulted in environmental degradation due
   to tree removal and soil exposure to erosion factors; however, planting
   native trees, such as Mimosa tenuiflora and Cnidoscolus quercifolius,
   may accelerate environmental recovery. Tree recovery was evaluated in a
   degraded areas under a 14-year period of grazing exclusion (2005 to
   2019) and planting of M. tenuiflora (2005 and 2009) and C. quercifolius
   (2007 and 2009) and under natural regeneration. Data on survival,
   height, and diameter of planted seedlings, and the number, species,
   height, and diameter of naturally regenerating trees were collected. The
   absence of grazing allowed for the establishment of 50.5\% and 44.6\% of
   the 204 M. tenuiflora and 204 C. quercifolius planted seedlings, which
   presented mean heights of 395 and 355 cm and mean basal diameters of 92
   and 76 mm. Naturally regenerated M. tenuiflora and C. quercifolius
   totaled 190 and 7 plants, with heights of 95 and 139 cm, and basal
   diameters of 10 and 26 mm. A naturally established specimen of
   Cenostigma pyramidale with a height of 175 cm and basal diameter of 36
   mm was found. This denotes the positive effect of seedling planting on
   tree cove compared to a nearby continuously grazed area; however, full
   recovery, especially regarding diversity of the tree community, requires
   more than 14year grazing exclusion, tree planting, and natural
   regeneration.},

Abstract = {The transformation of tropical ecosystems by humans have resulted in
   forest loss, which, in turn, have caused negative impacts on
   biodiversity and the provisioning of ecosystem services. There is an
   urgent need to plan the restoration of these human-modified landscapes,
   using methodological approaches that consider key processes occurring at
   different spatial scales while engage local community participation,
   offering them the best possibilities of tangible benefits. In this
   study, was evaluated the landscape spatial pattern and local
   conservation status of existing forest remnants, showing an analysis of
   possible restoration scenarios for a human-modified landscape in La
   Montana, an indigenous region in southwestern Mexico. Therefore,
   landscape and local scale approaches were linked to identify specific
   landscape elements where efforts to improve connectivity must be
   concentrated. Also, this approach allowed finding a set of species from
   reference sites that showed the best socioecological characteristics to
   be used in different restoration strategies. As expected, La Montana
   region showed a spatial pattern typical of highly human-modified
   landscapes, i.e., several small (<21 ha) and irregular forest remnants
   with strong forest edge effects. Furthermore, these small and irregular
   forest fragments displayed forest structure, diversity and composition
   characteristics similar to those communities disturbed by selective
   harvesting or in an early successional phase. However, about 100 of
   woody species were found inside the fragments, some with important
   potential to provide ecosystem services. The landscape connectivity was
   very low, and an analysis of possible restoration scenarios showed that
   is equally important to restore the productive areas as well as open
   forest, to recover up to 47\% of landscape connectivity. In this sense,
   it was proposed a productive restoration strategy to enrich open forests
   and create biodiversity-friendly habitat in agricultural areas, using
   species with high socioecological potential. We believe that the same
   approach could be applied to other highly human-modified tropical
   landscapes with similar socioecological problems. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {Beta differential diversity of Coleoptera (Insecta) in an anthropized
   landscape of the Bioma Araucaria. This study is part of an ongoing
   project on factors affecting abundance of coleopterans in the Vila Velha
   State Park, Ponta Grossa, Parand (PROVIVE). We assessed beta diversity
   changes as a function of anthropogenic disturbance levels for insects in
   a forest fragment of the Bioma Araucaria (Floresta Ombrofila Mista). We
   stratified the study area into five disturbance regions: 1. a managed
   transitional forest-grass area; 2. an Araucaria angustifolia forest
   plantation without any management; 3. an early/middle vegetational
   succession area; 4. a middle/late vegetational succession area, and 5. a
   late vegetational succession area in advanced stage. We collected
   insects weekly using malaise traps for a period of 52 weeks from
   September 1999 to August 2000. We collected 10,822 beetles from 1,659
   species. Beta diversity indices indicated high turnover rates among
   sampling areas. Highest beta diversity was observed between transitional
   forest grass area and forested areas. The successional areas were the
   most similar. Among successional areas, beta diversity was highest
   between advanced succession and the early succession areas. We show that
   high insect diversity can be maintained by preserving biodiversity
   hotspots within the study area, as well as maintaining a mosaic of sites
   with different vegetational successions and native flora plantation.
   Additionally, coleopteran diversity was sensitive to habitat alteration,
   which may make this taxon a good indicator for disturbance of forested
   regions.},

Abstract = {Urgent solutions to global climate change are needed. Ambitious
   tree-planting initiatives, many already underway, aim to sequester
   enormous quantities of carbon to partly compensate for anthropogenic CO2
   emissions, which are a major cause of rising global temperatures.
   However, tree planting that is poorly planned and executed could
   actually increase CO2 emissions and have long-term, deleterious impacts
   on biodiversity, landscapes and livelihoods. Here, we highlight the main
   environmental risks of large-scale tree planting and propose 10 golden
   rules, based on some of the most recent ecological research, to
   implement forest ecosystem restoration that maximizes rates of both
   carbon sequestration and biodiversity recovery while improving
   livelihoods. These are as follows: (1) Protect existing forest first;
   (2) Work together (involving all stakeholders); (3) Aim to maximize
   biodiversity recovery to meet multiple goals; (4) Select appropriate
   areas for restoration; (5) Use natural regeneration wherever possible;
   (6) Select species to maximize biodiversity; (7) Use resilient plant
   material (with appropriate genetic variability and provenance); (8) Plan
   ahead for infrastructure, capacity and seed supply; (9) Learn by doing
   (using an adaptive management approach); and (10) Make it pay (ensuring
   the economic sustainability of the project). We focus on the design of
   long-term strategies to tackle the climate and biodiversity crises and
   support livelihood needs. We emphasize the role of local communities as
   sources of indigenous knowledge, and the benefits they could derive from
   successful reforestation that restores ecosystem functioning and
   delivers a diverse range of forest products and services. While there is
   no simple and universal recipe for forest restoration, it is crucial to
   build upon the currently growing public and private interest in this
   topic, to ensure interventions provide effective, long-term carbon sinks
   and maximize benefits for biodiversity and people.},

Abstract = {Ecological restoration aims to retrieve not only the structure but also
   the functionality of ecosystems. Frugivorous birds may play an important
   role in this process due to their efficiency in seed dispersal. Color
   perception in these animals is highly developed, and then the colors of
   fleshy fruits may provide important clues for choosing plant species for
   restoration plans. This study aims to integrate bird color preferences
   and restoration of degraded areas, with an objective to evaluate the
   potential attractiveness to birds by colored fruits. We carried out an
   experiment with 384 artificial fruits made of edible modeling clay with
   the following colors: black, blue, green and red, with 96 fruits of each
   color in six sites, including four restored areas and two second-growth
   forest fragments. We also tested the possible effect of light intensity
   on fruit consumption by color. A total of 120 (38.6\%) were assumed to
   be consumed by birds, and the fruit consumption varied in response to
   the location and light incidence. Consumption of black and blue fruits
   was not related to site by chance. Notwithstanding, red and black fruits
   were consumed significantly more than any other colors, emphasizing bird
   preference to these colors, regardless of location. Enrichment with
   shade tolerant shrubs or forest species with black or red fruits may be
   an alternative way to manage established restorations. In recently
   established or new restorations, one may introduce pioneer shrubs or
   short-lived forest species which have blue fruits, but also those having
   black or red ones.},

Title = {Spatially explicit models of land abandonment in the Amazon},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF LAND USE SCIENCE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {11},
Number = {1},
Pages = {48-75},
Abstract = {Given growing concerns about biodiversity loss and carbon emissions
   stemming from tropical deforestation, it is important to identify the
   factors associated with land abandonment as they might indicate areas
   that were deforested but are unsuitable for long-term cultivation. This
   article utilizes a high-resolution, Landsat-based data-set called
   TerraClass to relate land abandonment to precipitation, slope, farmgate
   price of beef, market access, soil quality, and land tenure
   characteristics in the Brazilian Amazon. The spatially explicit
   statistical models reveal that rates of land abandonment increase with
   higher rainfall and slope values, even when controlling for distance to
   roads, farmgate prices, type of settlement, and soil quality. Moreover,
   land adjacent to a major road is more likely to be consistently
   cultivated, but land near large rivers and far from highways is more
   likely to be abandoned. Land ownership type also influences the
   likelihood of land abandonment as settlements based on communal property
   rights have higher rates of land abandonment than settlements with
   private lots. These results suggest that policies aimed at occupying
   tropical forests such as the Amazon must consider these biophysical and
   socioeconomic factors in order to foster human development aligned with
   sustainability principles.},

Abstract = {Aboveground biomass in cattle pasture converted from tropical dense
   forest was studied both before and after reburning in Brazilian
   Amazonia. In a 7-year-old pasture studied in Apiau, Roraima, the
   aboveground dry weight of biomass (live plus dead) exposed to burning
   consisted of 96.3 t ha(-1) of original forest remains, 6.2 t ha(-1) of
   secondary successional vegetation (woody invaders in the pasture), and
   8.0 t ha(-1) of pasture grass (carbon contents 48.2\%, 45.4\%, and
   42.2\%, respectively). In terms of carbon, burning efficiencies for
   these three categories were 13.2\%, 66.7\% and 94.6\%, respectively. Net
   charcoal formation was 0.35 t C ha(-1) or 0.63\% of the carbon exposed
   to the reburn, while the total accumulated since conversion (including
   the initial burn) is estimated at 2.3 t ha(-1) (1.82\% of the
   predeforestation aboveground biomass carbon stock). The dynamics of the
   original forest remains were represented in simulations that included
   parameters such as charcoal formation, burning efficiency and carbon
   concentration in different biomass components. Releases from initial
   burning of the cleared forest (44.0 t C ha(-1)) plus releases over the
   course of the succeeding decade through combustion (12.5 t C ha(-1)) and
   decay (51.5 t C ha(-1)) total 92\% of the original forest biomass carbon
   (126 t C ha(-1)). Of biomass carbon remaining after the initial burn
   (84.3 t C ha(-1)), 76.0\% is released: 61.1\% through decay and 14.9\%
   through combustion in reburns, while 1.2\% is net conversion to charcoal
   in the reburns. These results indicate an amount of charcoal
   accumulation that is smaller than some carbon calculations have assumed,
   therefore suggesting a greater impact on global warming from conversion
   of forest to pasture.},

Abstract = {Joannesia princeps, popularly known as a cutieira, is a Euphorbiaceae
   endemic to Brazil and its wood is used for various industrial purposes
   and the seed has approximately 37\% of useful oil for industrial and

   ecological succession in degraded areas, whose seeds serve as food for
   agoutis. The objective was to study germination, phenology and
   morphometry of fruits, seeds and seedlings of Joannesia princeps. We
   used 1,000 fruits of Joannesia princeps harvested from 40 matrices of
   Atlantic Forest surrounding Caparao, which make up an existing forest in
   the Municipal Garden of the city of Alegre, in Espirito Santo state, in
   which qualitative attributes were analyzed in relation morphology. In
   the biometric analysis, the following were analyzed: length, diameter
   and thickness and seedling analyses were conducted periodically on the
   6th, 7th, 14th, 21th, 28th, 35th and 42th days after germination (DAG),
   using four replicates of 15 normal and healthy seedlings for

   whitish for yellowish-white between the 14th and 21st DAG, while the
   hypocotyl, in the initial presented reddish color passing to green after
   the 14th DAG. The other organs did not present considerable changes,
   however, biometrically, all organs showed an increase in their
   dimensions, according to the evolution of development. The morphological

Journal = {DENDROCHRONOLOGIA},
Year = {2017},

Abstract = {In tropical forest, landscape fragmentation and the consequent
   degradation of disturbed forests increase the incidence of light and dry
   hot winds, causing a disturbance on natural regeneration. Under these
   conditions, lianas (woody vines) development is stimulated instead of
   other species, which are more suited to mature forest and under less
   influence of the edge effect. For this, lianas colonization is an
   important variable for assessing the disturbance level of a forest. In
   this context, it becomes important to understand the nature of the
   competitive relationships between hyper-abundant lianas and ring growth
   of the host trees. Here, we selected trees with occupation or absence of
   lianas from two tropical species Pinus caribaea var. hondurensis
   (Caribbean pine) and Tectona grandis (teak) -localized in a
   semideciduous forest fragment in southeastern Brazil, aiming to compare
   growth, climatic response, anatomy (vessels and intra-annual density
   fluctuations), wood density and carbon, by tree-ring analysis. The
   results showed that the lianas caused a change in tree-ring anatomy of
   host trees in last 10 years, mainly. We observed that trees occupied by
   lianas had a decrease the radial growth and carbon in the two species,
   an increase of the vessels size in teak and a decrease of the IADF
   frequency in Caribbean pine. In teak, the climatetree relationship
   indicated that trees with lianas had lower response to rainfall and
   higher response to temperature in the summer (rainy and hottest period);
   in Caribbean pine, we observed that trees with lianas had a 2-month
   delay in the radial growth response to rainfall in the dry season. In
   the teak group, we observed that host trees had higher wood density
   values than liana-free tree in the outer rings, and the opposite was
   showed for pine. These findings show that tree-ring growth of host trees
   are a strong bioindicator of forest disturbance caused by aggressive
   colonization of lianas. We believe that these methods are applicable to
   future studies relating to the effects of habitat fragmentation and
   forest degradation on biodiversity and ecosystem services, particularly
   in the context of global climate change. (C) 2016 Elsevier GmbH. All

Title = {Improving the biodiversity in urban green spaces: A nature based
   approach},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {173},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Urban green spaces have the reputation of limited potential to support
   biodiversity and public places located in urbanized regions normally
   sustain low levels of biodiversity. But there is the potential to
   improve such characteristics using restoration techniques that are
   easily implemented and cost-effective. In this study we implemented a
   set of nature-based interventions aiming to boost the local biodiversity
   of three urban parks in Sorocaba, SP, Brazil. Our interventions were
   designed to induce local ecological succession. In each park, we
   prepared nine sampling units (SU) by removing grass in a circle of 1 m
   diameter each. During the period of the study, three Sus in each park
   were kept uncovered (control treatment), three received -forest litter
   collected in an adjacent, well-conserved forest fragment (transposition
   treatment), and in the other three SUs, we installed a perch (perch
   treatment). For one year following establishment of the treatment, we
   monitored each SU biweekly and recorded the number and identity of
   seedlings that germinated in the circles. We recorded fluctuations in
   the number of seedlings in all experimental treatments of the three
   parks, indicating the variable rate of survivorship among species. We
   recorded a total of 30 different genera, most of which were herbaceous
   plants of species native to the region. In terms of the category of seed
   dispersion syndrome, most seedlings were from species dispersed by
   abiochoric vectors. Asteraceae was the most common botanical family. On
   one hand, if the experimental techniques we tested did not achieve the
   expected success in terms of the number of species of shrubs and trees,
   on the other hand, such interventions were not harmful in that they did
   not result in a predominance of exotic species. We conclude that this
   kind of approach has the potential to be successfully implemented in
   urban green spaces due to the simplicity of elaboration and
   implementation, respect of the natural structure and functioning (it is
   a nature-based alternative), and with an appropriate cost-benefit.},

Journal = {BIOTROPICA},

Volume = {53},

Abstract = {The regime of frequent small disturbances, such as the formation of
   tree-fall gaps, is an important mechanism maintaining the diversity in
   tropical forests. Occurring primarily in forest gaps, or in riparian
   vegetation, ant gardens (hereafter AGs) are mutualistic associations
   involving several epiphytic plant species and ants. In the Amazon
   rainforest, a widespread AGs association is assembled by two aggressive
   species of parabiotic ants (Camponotus femoratus and Crematogaster
   levior). Working together, these ants aggressively monopolize food
   resources and attack any intruder on the AGs. Here, we demonstrated the
   extended protective effect of parabiotic ants on the leaf herbivory of
   neighboring plants, contrasting plants with and without extrafloral
   nectaries (hereafter EFNs). We performed the fieldwork in South Amazonia
   where we found 33 forest gaps, 16 with and 17 without AGs. Independently
   of the presence of AGs, plants possessing EFNs have less area removed by
   herbivores and fewer leaves with herbivore marks than those without
   EFNs. This decrease in herbivory was remarkable on EFN-plants growing in
   gaps that also harbor AGs. Additional manipulative experiments confirmed
   this pattern: The AG-ants were more efficient than no-AG ants in
   removing live termite baits placed on EFN-plants, but few attacks were
   observed on plants without EFNs. Thus, AG-ants can extend their role in
   defending ant gardens from other plants growing in the same area,
   particularly those with EFNs. This extension of the mutualism benefits
   can affect the dynamics of the ecological succession and coevolutionary
   process in the Amazon forest.

Abstract = {Primary production (PP) is a fundamental ecosystem function that
   influences several ecosystem services. However, little is known about
   how changes in landscape structure resulting from agricultural expansion
   affects forest and cropland production. We investigated the effect of
   landscape composition and configuration on the PP of forests and
   sugarcane crops in an old agricultural frontier of the Brazilian
   Atlantic forest. Using satellite images and a comprehensive dataset of
   vegetation indices that are proxies of PP (NDVI and EVI), we sampled
   1201-km(2) landscapes during the rainy and dry seasons of 2011-2016. In
   each landscape we quantified the indices, the percentage of sugarcane
   crops, the density of forest edges, and the number of forest patches.
   The NDVI and EVI of the entire landscape were negatively influenced by
   the percentage of croplands in both seasons and weakly affected by edge
   density and number of forest patches. When analyzing the NDVI of forests
   and croplands separately, both were negatively affected by the
   percentage of croplands. This indicates that forests and croplands are
   less productive in more deforested landscapes. The spatial variability
   of NDVI and EVI within the landscapes, estimated with coefficients of
   variation, was not affected by landscape attributes. Our findings
   indicate that landscape composition (i.e. forest cover) is more
   important than spatial configuration in determining the PP of forest and
   sugarcane crops, reinforcing the need to conserve forests in
   agricultural landscapes. We recommend reducing deforestation, restoring
   abandoned fields, protecting forest remnants and avoiding forest
   fragmentation to sustain more productive environmental-friendly
   agricultural landscapes. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Editora Ltda. on

Abstract = {The diversity, richness and composition of the soil epigeous fauna
   community were evaluated in a revegetated gully at the Instituto Federal
   de Educacao (IFRJ) campus Nilo Pecanha, in the municipality of
   Pinheiral, Rio de Janeiro state. Revegetation was performed in 2000, and
   consisted of four different strategies involving N-fixing trees:
   planting Acacia mangium Willd. (PA); planting Mimosa caesalpiniifolia
   Benth. (PM); on the outer edges of the gully head (PTS); and planting a
   mix of legume tree species into the gully (IVR2000). Acacia mangium and
   Mimosa caesalpiniifolia were planted above the gully head. A nearby
   20-year secondary forest remnant was used as a reference site. Ten
   pitfall traps were used for the sampling of epigeous fauna at each one
   of the five areas (MOLDENKE, 1994). Sampling was performe in May 2000,
   June 2006, and April 2008. Six years after revegetation has started,
   fauna group richness and diversity increased both into the gully and in
   Mimosa caesalpiniifolia plantation. For the 2000 and 2006 samplings a
   PCA showed that groups were mostly associated to 2006, and completely
   opposite to 2000. Acacia mangium plantation had the lowest group
   richness. In the 2008 sampling, pasture showed the lowest group

Abstract = {Riparian forests have an important role in the maintenance of
   environmental services and in the conservation of species, playing the
   role of genetic corridor for flora and fauna. The present study was
   conducted with the objective of analyzing the species composition and
   horizontal structure in a restored riparian forest with an adjacent
   native area, in the municipality of Poco Fundo, Minas Gerais. A
   floristic and phytosociological survey of the tree sinusia was carried
   out in the areas. We sampled 199 individuals and 24 species in the
   restored area and 105 individuals and 23 species in the native area. No
   floristic similarity was verified between the areas. Shannon diversity
   was low in both areas. In the restored area, there is a predominance of
   early species while in the native area there is a predominance of late
   species. No floristic convergence was verified between the two studied
   areas, having been verified structural convergence between the areas
   after 13 years of the beginning of the restoration.},

Abstract = {The Funda similar to o Dam rupture in Mariana, Brazil spilled
   contaminated tailings across the Doce River basin reaching several towns
   such as Ipaba. Ibapa's agricultural and fishing activities declined by
   50\% due to the toxicity of sodium and ether-amine, followed by a
   reduction of nitrate resulting in inhibition of plant growth and biota.
   A settler's community in Ipaba composed of 51 families whose main
   sources of income were agriculture and fishing activities have abandoned
   their properties because the land became unproductive after the Funda
   similar to o dam rupture, and the rural exodus is a current concern in
   the town. However, previous research has demonstrated that the
   remediation of sodium and ether-amine, as well as the recovery of soil
   fertility is feasible, enabling the establishment of the native Atlantic
   Forest and crop species. Such procedures are recommended to recover the
   agricultural production in Ipaba. Aiming at protecting these cropping
   areas against flooding, we propose the creation of riparian forests in
   the floodplains. In order to make the settlers able to properly manage
   their lands in a post-disaster scenario, a recovery plan for Ipaba may
   be implemented via nature based solutions supported by social capital
   actions such as agroforestry technical training schools and social
   association, which are shown through schemes and three-dimensional
   modelling.},

Abstract = {The effects of reduced-impact logging (RIL) on the regeneration of
   commercial tree species were investigated, as long-term timber yields
   depend partly on the availability of seedlings in a managed forest. On
   four occasions during a 20-month period in the Tapajos National Forest
   (Eastern Amazon, Brazil), seven commercial tree species were assessed as
   follows: the long-lived pioneers Bagassa guianensis and Jacaranda
   copaia; the partially shade-tolerant Hymenaea courbaril, Dipteryx
   odorata, and Carapa guianensis; and the totally shade-tolerant Symphonia
   globulifera and Manilkara huberi. In 2439 10x10m plots, all individuals
   < 20cm diameter at breast height (dbh) were assessed over three
   intervals, before, during, and after the forest being logged. Before
   logging, the density of seedlings and saplings of the seven species did
   not change. Logged trees were spatially aggregated, with 9.2 percent of
   the plots being heavily impacted by logging. After logging, the
   recruitment rate increased more than the mortality rate, so that
   post-harvesting densities of seedlings and saplings increased. The
   increase in density was concentrated in logged plots with more
   disturbances. It is concluded that post-harvesting heterogeneity of
   micro-environments created by RIL may be an important component to be
   taken into account for sustainable forest management and conservation of
   commercial species.},

Abstract = {Understanding how tropical rainforest trees may respond to the
   precipitation extremes predicted in future climate change scenarios is
   paramount for their conservation and management. Tree species clearly
   differ in drought susceptibility, suggesting that variable water
   transport strategies exist. Using a multi-disciplinary approach, we
   examined the hydraulic variability in trees in a lowland tropical
   rainforest in north-eastern Australia. We studied eight tree species
   representing broad plant functional groups (one palm and seven eudicot
   mature-phase, and early-successional trees). We characterised the
   species' hydraulic system through maximum rates of volumetric sap flow
   and velocities using the heat ratio method, and measured rates of tree
   growth and several stem, vessel, and leaf traits. Sap flow measures
   exhibited limited variability across species, although
   early-successional species and palms had high mean sap velocities
   relative to most mature-phase species. Stem, vessel, and leaf traits
   were poor predictors of sap flow measures. However, these traits
   exhibited different associations in multivariate analysis, revealing
   gradients in some traits across species and alternative hydraulic
   strategies in others. Trait differences across and within tree
   functional groups reflect variation in water transport and drought
   resistance strategies. These varying strategies will help in our
   understanding of changing species distributions under predicted drought
   scenarios.},

Title = {Alternative functional trajectories along succession after different

Journal = {JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY},

Volume = {56},

Abstract = {The recovery capacity and the successional pathways of tropical forests
   after anthropogenic disturbance vary considerably and may depend on
   prior land-use type and intensity. It is still unclear if forests
   subjected to high intensity impact, such as periodically burned
   pastures, are capable of restoring their original functional properties.
   This study analysed the functional trait dynamics of the dominant
   species in successional trajectories following two land uses, pasture or
   clear-cut, north of Manaus. Fourteen years of demographic data from the
   Biological Dynamics of Forest Fragments Project were used to determine
   the dominant species of the two successional trajectories, for which
   leaf area, leaf dry mass content, specific leaf area and wood density
   were collected, whereas seed mass was obtained from literature.
   Community weighted mean of each trait was weighted by basal area
   determined annually along succession. Prinicpal components analysis was
   used to analyse the extension and direction of the functional
   trajectories of plots. Forests regenerating from pastures increased in
   wood density through successional time, but other traits did not change
   significantly. Succession after clear-cut exhibited increasing leaf dry
   mass content and seed mass, and decreasing leaf area over time, but no
   change in wood density. Functional trajectories of plots after clear-cut
   were more extensive and directional than those of pasture-derived
   plots.Synthesis and applications. We demonstrate how central Amazonian
   secondary forests subjected to different land uses show differences in
   functional trait trajectories, in ways parallel to previously shown
   changes in biomass, floristic diversity and forest structure. These
   results indicate that natural recovery of forest functional traits is
   affected by prior land-use history, with implications for management and
   restoration. Thus, natural recovery of forests on abandoned pastures is
   much slower than clear-cuts, even though seed sources from mature
   forests are very close to these areas, and the former may need
   intervention to counteract the diverted succession.
   Resumo
   A capacidade de recuperacAo e os caminhos sucessionais das florestas
   tropicais apos perturbacoes antropicas variam consideravelmente e podem
   depender do tipo e da intensidade previa do uso da terra. Ainda nAo esta
   claro se as florestas sujeitas a impactos de alta intensidade, como
   pastagens periodicamente queimadas, sAo capazes de restaurar suas
   propriedades funcionais originais. Este estudo analisou a dinamica de
   atributos funcionais das especies dominantes em trajetorias sucessionais
   apos dois usos da terra, pastagem ou corte raso, ao norte de Manaus.
   Quatorze anos de dados demograficos do Projeto de Dinamica Biologica de
   Fragmentos Florestais foram utilizados para determinar as especies
   dominantes das duas trajetorias sucessionais, para as quais foram
   coletadas area foliar, conteudo de massa seca foliar, area foliar
   especifica e densidade de madeira enquanto que a massa das sementes foi
   obtida da literatura. A media ponderada da comunidade (CWM) de cada
   atributo foi ponderada pela area basal determinada anualmente ao longo
   da sucessAo. Uma PCA foi utilizada para analisar a extensAo e direcAo
   das trajetorias funcionais das parcelas. Florestas regeneradas de
   pastagens aumentaram a densidade da madeira atraves do tempo de
   sucessAo, mas outras caracteristicas nAo mudaram significativamente. A
   sucessAo apos corte apresentou maior conteudo de massa seca foliar e
   massa de sementes, alem de diminuir a area foliar ao longo do tempo, mas
   sem alteracAo na densidade da madeira. Trajetorias funcionais de
   parcelas apos corte raso foram mais extensas e direcionais do que as de
   parcelas derivadas de pastagens.Sintese e aplicacoes. Este trabalho
   demonstra como as florestas secundarias da Amazonia central submetidas a
   diferentes usos da terra apresentam diferencas nas trajetorias de seus
   atributos funcionais, de forma paralela as mudancas anteriormente
   mostradas na biomassa, na diversidade floristica e na estrutura
   florestal. Estes resultados indicam que a recuperacAo natural de
   atributos funcionais da floresta e afetada pela historia anterior de uso
   da terra, com implicacoes para o manejo e restauracAo. Assim, a
   recuperacAo natural de florestas em pastos abandonados e muito mais
   lenta do que cortes rasos, embora as fontes de sementes de florestas
   maduras sejam muito proximas dessas areas, e as primeiras precisarAo de

Abstract = {Clearing tropical vegetation impacts biodiversity, the provision of
   ecosystem services, and thus ultimately human welfare. We quantified
   changes in land cover from 2000 to 2015 across the Cerrado biome of
   northern Minas Gerais state, Brazil. We assessed the potential
   biophysical and socio-economic drivers of the loss of Cerrado, natural
   regeneration and net cover change at the municipality level. Further, we
   evaluated correlations between these land change variables and
   indicators of human welfare. We detected extensive land cover changes in
   the study area, with the conversion of 23 446 km(2) and the natural
   regeneration of 13 926 km(2), resulting in a net loss of 9520 km(2). The
   annual net loss (-1.2\% per year) of the cover of Cerrado is higher than
   that reported for the whole biome in similar periods. We argue that
   environmental and economic variables interact to underpin rates of
   conversion of Cerrado, most severely affecting more humid Cerrado
   lowlands. While rates of Cerrado regeneration are important for
   conservation strategies of the remaining biome, their integrity must be
   investigated given the likelihood of encroachment. Given the high
   frequency of land abandonment in tropical regions, secondary vegetation
   is fundamental to maintain biodiversity and ecosystem services. Finally,
   the impacts of Cerrado conversion on human welfare likely vary from
   local to regional scales, making it difficult to elaborate land-use
   policies based solely on socio-economic indicators.

Abstract = {One approach in forest restoration is to plant trees that will establish
   an initial canopy to promote forest recovery through the colonization of
   other species. The identity of the planted tree affects which species
   are able to recruit in its understory. Here we evaluate the phylogenetic
   structure of young understory plant communities recruiting beneath
   eleven different species planted in single species stands and relate
   those structures with processes affecting community assembly. We
   expected the presence of negative biotic interactions between closely
   related overstory and understory species, as well as among related
   understory species, to lead to phylogenetic overdispersion. However, we
   did not find consistent phylogenetic patterns maybe due to the young age
   of the understory communities at the time of sampling. Most overstories
   showed a higher than expected presence of close relatives due to the
   recruitment of con specifics, whereas, the higher recruitment of the
   ancient Glade of Piperaceae beneath Fabaceae trees led to
   overdispersion. The presence of various Asteraceae species in
   understories that had been invaded by the grass, Saccharum spontaneum,
   led to significant clustering suggesting the conservatism of traits that
   allow overcoming the strong competition imposed by the grass.
   Phylogenetic patterns among the recruiting species showed that dispersal
   and competition are playing a role in shaping the communities. Our
   results highlight the importance of choosing an adequate set of species
   to plant in a restoration project since they dictate the subsequent
   regeneration of a forest community. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {Can transplantation of forest seedlings be a strategy to enrich seedling

Abstract = {Transplanting individual seedlings is a tool used in restoration
   studies, which helps to select species that are adapted to particular
   bioclimatic regions. We aimed to identify forest and physiological
   patterns in seedlings from extant areas of the Atlantic forest biome in
   southern Brazil. Individual tree and shrub seedlings from 5 to 55 cm in
   height were selected from an extant area of approximately 20 ha,
   transplanted to a nursery and separated into groups by size. Survival
   and growth rates were assessed periodically over ten months and
   physiological variables (chlorophyll a and b content, carotenoid content
   and chlorophyll a fluorescence) were measured at the end of the
   experiment. In total, 1018 seedlings were transplanted, belonging to 23
   families and 50 species. The survival rate, which was on average 74.5\%,
   varied among the height groups, with the highest mortality rate
   occurring shortly after transplantation. Some physiological
   characteristics of Eugenia rostrifolia, Cupania vernalis, Nectandra
   megapotamica, Trichilia claussenii, Sorocea bonplandii, Actinostemon
   concolor, Trichilia elegans and Cordia trichotoma change when they are
   transplanted to a plant nursery. However, an assessment of their growth
   rates confirmed that these species can develop metabolic strategies that
   increase their carbon uptake. The main adaptations to increase survival
   rates were an accumulation of carotenoids and the loss of excess energy
   in the form of chlorophyll a fluorescence. We conclude that species
   displayed physiological adaptations that support metabolic activities
   and survival after transplantation. In light of the higher survival
   rates and favorable plant development, we consider transplantation to be
   a potential complementary strategy for native species seedling
   production. Transplantation could increase the growth potential of
   species that are difficult to produce in plant nurseries and
   consequently support greater diversity in restoration efforts. However,
   further studies are needed to assess the survival rate of these
   transplanted seedlings in restoration plantations in comparison with
   non-transplanted seedlings. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Descriptions of individual breeding bird biologies provide important
   insights to our understanding of avian life history strategies. The
   present study focused on the reproductive biology and nesting ecology of
   the Olivaceous Flatbill (Rhynchocyclus olivaceus) in the Parque
   Zoobotanico (similar to 100 ha) of the Universidade Federal do Acre,
   Brazil, between April 2015 and March 2016. We found 91 nests, of which
   14 were active and 77 were abandoned. Due to multiple nest failure
   incidents, we only monitored a single nest throughout the breeding
   period from nest construction to offspring fledging. This nest was built
   in 14 d, eggs were incubated for 26 d, and nestlings remained in the
   nest for additional 21 d. The nest was classified as closed,
   retort-shaped, and pensile. We deconstructed one nest that had a weight
   of 65 g composed of twigs (31.6\% of the total weight), fibers (28.9\%),
   leaves (14.5\%), bark (9.2\%), bamboo pieces (9.2\%), and tendrils
   (6.6\%). We found the nests at heights of 1-9 m above the ground, with a
   preference for a 2-4 m stratum, built atop 25 different plant species.
   The 4 species that were the most frequently used as nest substrate were
   Protium unifoliolatum (n = 16 nests), Casearia sp. (n = 11), Siparuna
   guianensis (n = 10), and Couepia sp. (n = 9). The Olivaceous Flatbill
   breeds throughout the year, in both rainy and dry seasons, and it seems
   to be highly sensitive to human disturbance during the breeding season.
   The reproductive parameters recorded in the present study were
   consistent with those reported for other species of this genus, although
   most of the findings are novel for the Olivaceous Flatbill and provide
   important insights into its reproductive biology in the Amazon region.},

Abstract = {Understanding the response of seed rain and seed bank to landscape
   changes is critical for maintaining the forest remnants integrity and
   the potential for natural regeneration in abandoned lands. Ecological
   research typically focuses on direct responses of these seed processes
   (i.e., seed rain and seed bank), without considering the relationship
   between them or the indirect impact of landscape changes on these
   processes via its influence on seed dispersers and seed predation. Here,
   we employ structuring equation modeling to quantify the direct and
   indirect effects of landscape structure and biotic interaction on
   bird-dispersed seed rain and seed banks in the Atlantic Forest. We
   conducted the study in 20 highly fragmented landscapes. Our study shows
   that lower seed disperser, seed rain and seed bank abundances, as well
   as higher seed predation rates will be found in a landscape context with
   higher percentage of pasture, isolated forest fragments and in matrices
   far from forest edge. The indirect effect of landscape change was
   related to the negative influence of seed predation rates on the seed
   bank abundance. Based on our results, we recommend managing the
   landscapes trying to increase the connectivity among the forest remnants
   and reduce the percentage of pasture, in order to improve the seed
   dispersal and decrease the seed predation rates. In addition, it is
   essential that management plans evaluate these processes as a whole to
   accelerate forest recovery due to the complex relationships associated
   with seed rain and seed bank.

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {One of the main alternatives for the rational exploitation of the
   Caatinga biome's natural resources is sustainable forest management (FM)
   which can influence different components of the ecosystem, such as
   vegetation and soil. Therefore, the objective of this study was to
   evaluate the short-term effect of different forest management practices
   on total organic C stocks and soil aggregate classes in the Caatinga
   area located in Contendas do Sincora (BA). Three forest management
   practices (selectively cutting by species, selectively cutting by
   diameter and clear cutting) were evaluated, using the unmanaged Caatinga
   as a control. Soil samples were collected at 0-10 cm depth after two
   years of natural regeneration, following the management treatments. Soil
   samples were fractionated to obtain macroaggregated fractions (2000-250
   mu m), microaggregates (250-53 mu m) and silt+clay (<53 mu m). The first
   two fractions were sonicated to obtain the occluded and particulate
   carbon. In the short-term, forest management promoted reduction of total
   organic C stocks, but did not cause changes in the distribution and C
   stocks of the aggregate classes.},

Journal = {FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {482},

Abstract = {Our aims were to describe the role of the selective management of
   regenerating community (RC) on the recovery of ecosystem functions in
   production areas of African mahoganies under mixed stands and
   agroforestry systems, established on abandoned farmland. A randomized
   block experiment was set up with the following treatments: (T1)
   mixed-plantation of African mahogany under conventional system
   (including herbicide application); (T2) mixed-plantation of African
   mahogany with selective conduction of RC; (T3) agroforestry system with
   African mahogany; (T4) agroforestry system with African mahogany with
   selective conduction of RC. The parameters of horizontal structure,
   diversity and ecological attributes of species of the regenerating
   community were studied. In addition, the production of aboveground
   biomass and nutrient stocks, soil fertility, and soil microbial activity
   were assessed. In T1, herbicide application (glyphosate) affected the
   floristic composition of the regenerating community by reducing the
   dominance of monocots and Pteridium arachnoideum, allowing the
   regeneration of other taxonomic groups of herbaceous species. In
   response, there was a reduction in the litter biomass stock comparing to
   the other treatments. The treatments with selective management of the RC
   (T2 and T4) produced more biomass and accumulated higher amounts of C
   and nutrients than the conventional treatments (T1 and T3). These
   treatments also allowed other shrub and tree species to overcome the
   ecological filter imposed by grasses and colonize the experimental area.
   Baccharis dracunculifolia, Vismia guianensis, Cecropia pachystachya and
   Inga sp. were the most important regenerating species that contributed
   most to the stocks of all nutrients in living aboveground biomass.
   Pruning and selective management in T4 increased the soil effective
   cation exchange, while in the T1 treatment there was a lower activity of
   the beta-glucosidase enzyme. The selective management of RC in
   agroforestry systems through the manipulation of competitive
   relationships allowed the colonization of native tree and shrubby
   species that provide several additional ecosystem services, including
   pollination, fauna attraction, food production, pest control and
   environmental regulation for the agroecosystem.},

Abstract = {The ``Serra do Mar{''} region comprises the largest remnant of the
   Brazilian Atlantic Forest. The coast of the Parana State is part of the
   core area of the ``Serra do Mar{''} corridor and where actions for
   biodiversity conservation must be planned. In this study we aimed at
   characterizing the landscape structure in the APA-Guaraquecaba, the
   largest protected area in this region, in order to assist environmental
   policies of this region. Based on a supervised classification of a
   mosaic of LANDSAT-5-TM satellite images (from March 2009), we developed
   a map (1:75,000 scale) with seven classes of land use and land cover and
   analyzed the relative quantities of forests and modified areas in slopes
   and lowlands. The APA-Guaraquecaba is comprised mainly by the Dense
   Ombrophilous Forest (68.6\% of total area) and secondary forests
   (9.1\%), indicating a forested landscape matrix; anthropogenic and bare
   soil areas (0.8\%) and the Pasture/Grasslands class (4.2\%) were less
   representative. Slopes were less fragmented and more preserved (96.3\%
   of Dense Ombrophilous Forest and secondary forest) than lowlands
   (71.3\%), suggesting that restoration initiatives in the lowlands must
   be stimulated in this region. We concluded that most of the region

Volume = {39},

Abstract = {Fire is considered a major factor in the succession process in
   ``Cerrado'', determining the dynamics and composition of these
   Neotropical savanna plant formations. However, when savannas are
   protected from fire, both fire-tolerant and fire-sensitive plant species
   increase in density and size, especially species of trees. Nevertheless,
   how this change in the vegetation structure relates to changes in the
   ecosystem function has been seldom evaluated. Pollination is a major
   ecosystem service, and here we aimed to determine possible changes in
   floristic composition, floral biology, and pollination systems in an
   area of open savanna protected against fire over a period of 20 years in
   Minas Gerais state, Central Brazil. The comparison over the two decades
   showed that ecological succession, in the absence of fire, increased the
   diversity and decreased the dominance of plant species. There was an
   increase in specie richness from 156 spp. in 1992 to 206 spp. in 2012,
   with appearance of trees and species with specialized pollination
   systems. Plants were predominantly pollinated by bees in both periods,
   but floral diversity and specialization seem to have increased after
   fire suppression, for instance, with the emergence of more species
   pollinated by moths. Not only generalist lightcolored actinomorphic
   flowers, but also tubular or cup-like nectar flowers commonly associated
   with more specialized pollinators predominated in both periods. The
   dominance of these contrasting features actually increased after two
   decades, especially when we compare the number of individuals in each
   group. However, it seems that the increase in plant diversity and
   density of woody species did not lead to marked specialization of floral
   features and pollination system along the studied period.},

Abstract = {Forest restoration in post-open pit mining areas is complex and faces
   the challenge of ``recreating{''} the soil under horizontal disruption,
   representing strong barriers to root growth. Hence, trenches (paths
   opened by digging) for planting are an alternative to improve root
   development conditions and plant growth. This study aimed to evaluate
   growth of six tree species planted in trenches under three treatments:
   Topsoil or control (CT), Sawdust (SD), and Cow manure (CM). The trenches
   (1 m in height and length by 40 m long) were filled with topsoil. In the
   6-m space between trenches, two treatments were performed: soil covered
   and not covered by sawdust to test natural regeneration. Six tree
   species (250 individuals) in pits over trenches where mortality, mean
   annual increment in height (MAIHt,), diameter (MAIDSH), and crown area
   (MAICA) were assessed. Natural regeneration and litter stock were also
   evaluated. After 18 months, mortality was zero, except Byrsonima spicata
   with less than 5\% in CT, SD, and CM. Clitoria fairchildiana, Tachigali
   vulgaris, and Croton matourensis showed highest MAIHt and MAIDSH, and C.
   fairchildiana presented the highest MAICA with no statistical
   differences among treatments. Sawdust coverage had no effects on litter
   amounts and on tree species from the natural regeneration. Herbs and
   grasses covered 45.5\% and 57.2\% of the soil with and without sawdust.
   Based on growth and mortality, C. fairchildiana, T. vulgaris, and C.
   matarensis can be recommended for initial restoration after kaolin
   mining.},

   region: Implications for farmers' livelihood and conservation},

Abstract = {The Brazilian Atlantic Forest is widely recognized for its high levels
   of biodiversity and endemism. Its vast region concentrates also a large
   number of small farmers, who historically have been practicing
   swidden-fallow cultivation. Globally, there is contradictory evidence of
   the current fate of this traditional, integrated agricultural system,
   and the new land uses may have a strong impact on farmers' livelihoods
   and ecosystem conservation. In this study, we assessed the land cover
   and land use change in a watershed where slash-and-burn cultivation was
   prevalent, aiming at understanding the drivers of change and discussing
   past and possible future impacts, including the perception of farmers on
   the drivers of land use change. We combined information gathered from
   interviews with 15 key informant farmers and from the analysis of remote
   sensing images for the years 1957, 1978 and 2011. Swidden-fallow
   cultivation has declined steadily since the 1950s. Part of the land was
   abandoned and forest succession was allowed to occur, increasing the
   total forest area; an apparently positive outcome. However, conversion
   to pastures and Eucalyptus plantations not only used much of the open
   land but also converted successional forests through deforestation,
   based on remote sensing. The willingness of farmers to grow more
   Eucalyptus and raise more cattle further increases concerns about the
   prospect for conservation. Our approach, combining remote sensing-based
   land change quantification and interviews, revealed to be complementary,
   allowing a better understanding of the past and possible future
   scenarios for the land use dynamics.},

Abstract = {Tropical plantations are considered a viable option to sequester carbon
   on abandoned agricultural lands, but implications of tree species
   selection for overall greenhouse gas budgets on plantations have been
   little studied. During three wet seasons, we investigated the influence
   of nine tree species on soil pH, temperature (ST), bulk density (BD),
   moisture content water filled pore space (WFPS), and greenhouse gas
   fluxes in diverse forest sites and monoculture plantation plots. All
   sites were on clay-rich soils of the Barreiras formation, in
   east-central Amazonia, Brazil. We found that ST and BD were 0.6 degrees
   C and 0.2g/cm(3) higher in the plantation relative to the forest, and
   soil CH4, CO,(2) and N2O fluxes were, respectively, 38, 12, 62, percent
   lower in the plantation. Tree growth rates were highly variable on the
   plantation, with the mean comparable to the forest sites. Tree species
   identity mattered (P<0.01) for all soil properties and gas fluxes on the
   plantation, but only for pH, BD, WFPS, and N2O fluxes in the forest. The
   species rank order of pH and N2O fluxes in the forest, however, were
   unlike the plantation. Tree growth rates were a strong predictor for
   soil WFPS, and together with location, they also explained 75 percent of
   the mean N2O flux variation. Our study indicates that: (1) tree species
   influence soil processes; and (2) high tree growth and low soil gas
   emissions imply a reduced climate forcing effect from plantations,
   especially when planted with fast-growing legume species on abandoned
   farmland.},

Journal = {SOCIOBIOLOGY},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {47},

Abstract = {Some seeds rely on fleshy lipid-rich appendages as attractants to ants.
   By carrying those seeds to their nest, ants play a major role as seed
   dispersers and can provide suitable conditions for seed germination.
   Ricinus communis (the commonly known castor) seeds are primarily
   dispersed by autochory but probably present secondary dispersal by ants,
   once they bear a lipid-rich elaiosome. The following questions were
   addressed: (1) are ants legitimate dispersers of castor seeds?; (2)
   which ant species interact with the seeds?; and (3) is germination
   success higher in a predicted scenario met by seeds discarded from ant
   nest? We compared the removal of seeds with and without elaiosome and we
   determined which ant species interact with castor seeds and whether
   there was seed predation by ants. We performed experiments under
   controlled conditions to evaluate seed germination responses to light,
   temperature and elaiosome. Seeds with elaiosome were removed
   preferentially and no predation was found, indicating that ants are
   legitimate seed dispersers. A large coterie of ants (20 species)
   interacts with castor seeds, especially Myrmicinae species. Elaiosome
   removal enhanced germination success, as well as alternated temperatures
   and absence of light. Such conditions arc a mixture of two of the three
   scenarios we assumed for castor seed germination, and are met by seeds
   discarded from ant nest, but covered by a thin layer of litter, or
   eventually abandoned inside the nest, but in shallow depths. Therefore,
   by discarding seeds without elaiosome on the pile mound, ants may submit
   castor seeds to conditions that enhance germination.},

Abstract = {Future climate change predictions for tropical forests highlight
   increased frequency and intensity of extreme drought events. However, it
   remains unclear whether large and small trees have differential
   strategies to tolerate drought due to the different niches they occupy.
   The future of tropical forests is ultimately dependent on the capacity
   of small trees (<10 cm in diameter) to adjust their hydraulic system to
   tolerate drought. To address this question, we evaluated whether the
   drought tolerance of neotropical small trees can adjust to experimental
   water stress and was different from tall trees. We measured multiple
   drought resistance-related hydraulic traits across nine common
   neotropical genera at the world's longest-running tropical forest
   throughfall-exclusion experiment and compared their responses with
   surviving large canopy trees. Small understorey trees in both the
   control and the throughfall-exclusion treatment had lower minimum
   stomatal conductance and maximum hydraulic leaf-specific conductivity
   relative to large trees of the same genera, as well as a greater
   hydraulic safety margin (HSM), percentage loss of conductivity and
   embolism resistance, demonstrating that they occupy a distinct hydraulic
   niche. Surprisingly, in response to the drought treatment, small trees
   increased specific hydraulic conductivity by 56.3\% and leaf:sapwood
   area ratio by 45.6\%. The greater HSM of small understorey trees
   relative to large canopy trees likely enabled them to adjust other
   aspects of their hydraulic systems to increase hydraulic conductivity
   and take advantage of increases in light availability in the understorey
   resulting from the drought-induced mortality of canopy trees. Our
   results demonstrate that differences in hydraulic strategies between
   small understorey and large canopy trees drive hydraulic niche
   segregation. Small understorey trees can adjust their hydraulic systems
   in response to changes in water and light availability, indicating that
   natural regeneration of tropical forests following long-term drought may

Abstract = {This study aims to assess the carbon stock in a pasture area and
   fragment of forest in natural regeneration, given the importance of
   agroforestry systems in mitigating gas emissions which contribute to the
   greenhouse effect, as well as promoting the maintenance of agricultural
   productivity. Our other goal was to predict the carbon stock, according
   to different land use systems, from physical and chemical soil variables
   using the Random Forest algorithm. We carried out our study at an
   Entisols Quartzipsamments area with a completely randomized experimental
   design: four treatments and six replites. The treatments consisted of
   the following: (i) an agroforestry system developed for livestock, (ii)
   an agroforestry system developed for fruit culture, (iii) a conventional
   pasture, and (iv) a forest fragment. Deformed and undeformed soil
   samples were collected in order to analyze their physical and chemical
   properties across two consecutive agricultural years. The response
   variable, carbon stock, was subjected to a boxplot analysis and all the
   databases were used for a predictive modeling which in turn used the
   Random Forest algorithm. Results led to the conclusion that the
   agroforestry systems developed both for fruit culture and livestock, are
   more efficient at stocking carbon in the soil than the pasture area and
   forest fragment undergoing natural regeneration. Nitrogen stock and land
   use systems are the most important variables to estimate carbon stock
   from the physical and chemical variables of soil using the Random Forest
   algorithm. The predictive models generated from the physical and
   chemical variables of soil, as well as the Random Forest algorithm,
   presented a high potential for predicting soil carbon stock and are
   sensitive to different land use systems.},

Journal = {FLORA},

Volume = {326},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Functional traits and strategies of trees can effectively indicate the
   progress of forest recovery during succession. This study investigates
   variations in leaf and wood traits, CSR functional strategies, and
   trade-offs in resource acquisition adopted by plants in secondary
   forests of different recovery ages, comparing them to old-growth
   forests. We also examined the relationships between traits, aboveground
   biomass dynamics, and edaphic variables in the Bragantina region,
   Eastern Amazon. Our evaluation focused on leaf area (LA), specific leaf
   area (SLA), leaf dry matter content (LDMC), and wood density (WD).
   Secondary forests exhibited higher LDMC and WD compared to old-growth
   forests, with low trait variation among secondary forests regardless of
   recovery age. Stress tolerance (S) was the dominant strategy in
   secondary forests, whereas old-growth forests showed a balanced
   proportion of stress tolerance and competitive strategies. Coordination
   was identified among WD, stress strategy (S), and LDMC. Significant
   relationships were found between functional traits and soil variables.
   Our results highlight the slow functional recovery of secondary forests
   in the Bragantina region which is associated with intense land use prior
   to natural regeneration and the fragmented landscape.},

Abstract = {Plant community succession is generally approached with
   phytosociological methods, but field surveys are time-consuming,
   expensive, and limited to several of sites. Remote sensing offers an
   efficient and economical way to analyze vegetation on large extensions
   and in inaccessible areas. Most studies addressing remote sensing and
   tree community succession refer to forest physiognomies. We investigated
   whether structural changes that occur in non-forest physiognomies are
   identified by multispectral sensor images (OLI-Landsat). Thirteen 0.1-ha
   plots were set up in Caatinga fragments aging 10-15, 20-25, 30-35, 40-45
   and >50 years to calculate the total density of individuals (TD), mean
   canopy height (H), total basal area (G) and total aboveground biomass
   (AGB). We performed correlation analyses between these structural
   descriptors and eight remote sensing variables (reflectance data and
   spectral indices) obtained from Landsat images at the end of the rainy
   season and during the dry season. Blue and short-wave infrared
   reflectances were negatively correlated with mean height, basal area and
   biomass, regardless of the analyzed scene (coefficients between-0.58
   and-0.79). The litter layer (a non-photosynthetic vegetation component)
   and the soil exposure are important factors influencing the spectral
   data.},

Title = {Knowledge, use and management of native wild edible plants from a
   seasonal dry forest (NE, Brazil)},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ETHNOBIOLOGY AND ETHNOMEDICINE},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {9},
Month = {NOV 26},
Abstract = {Background: Despite being an ancient practice that satisfies basic human
   needs, the use of wild edible plants tends to be forgotten along with
   associated knowledge in rural communities. The objective of this work is
   to analyze existing relationships between knowledge, use, and management
   of native wild edible plants and socioeconomic factors such as age,
   gender, family income, individual income, past occupation and current
   occupation.
   Methods: The field work took place between 2009 and 2010 in the
   community of Carao, Altinho municipality, in the state of Pernambuco in
   northeastern Brazil. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 39
   members of the community regarding knowledge, use and management of 14
   native wild edible plants from the Caatinga region, corresponding to 12
   vegetable species. In parallel, we documented the socioeconomic aspects
   of the interviewed population (age, gender, family income, individual
   income, past occupation and current occupation).
   Results: Knowledge about edible plants was related to age but not to
   current occupation or use. Current use was not associated with age,
   gender or occupation. The association between age and past use may
   indicate abandonment of these resources.
   Conclusion: Because conservation of the species is not endangered by
   their use but by deforestation of the ecosystems in which these plants
   grow, we suggest that the promotion and consumption of the plants by
   community members is convenient and thereby stimulates the appropriation
   and consequent protection of the ecosystem. To promote consumption of
   these plants, it is important to begin by teaching people about plant
   species that can be used for their alimentation, disproving existing
   myths about plant use, and encouraging diversification of use by
   motivating the invention of new preparation methods. An example of how
   this can be achieved is through events like the ``Preserves
   Festival{''}.},

Abstract = {In northeastern Brazil, areas converted for pasture and agriculture are
   often abandoned; therefore the recovered areas contain vegetation at
   different successional stages. The aim of this study was to characterize
   the diversity and structure of Caatinga vegetation areas with different
   histories of use in northeastern Brazil. Two areas were used: 1)
   preserved with no historical evidence of deforestation for agricultural
   purposes; and 2) regenerated after cultivation of Opuntia ficus-indica
   Mill., approximately 30 years ago. In each area, vegetation of 12 plots
   was collected, considering all individuals with circumference at 1.30 m
   above ground level (CAP) >= 6.0 cm. Collected species were classified
   according to dispersal strategy into the categories of anemochoric,
   zoochoric, and autochoric. For the analysis of a diversity, species
   richness, Shannon index, Pielou's evenness, and Simpson's index were
   used. beta diversity was evaluated using hierarchical cluster analysis.
   Structural analysis using density, basal area, and value of importance
   (VI) was conducted. A comparison between the diameter distributions of
   the areas was performed using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Indicator
   species analysis (ISA) was conducted to identify the species preferences
   per area. The relationship of beta diversity with the differences in the
   composition of species and their densities were analyzed with TWINSPAN.
   The two areas showed significant differences (p < 0.05) in richness,
   density, and basal area. There was no significant difference in
   diversity. Cluster analysis indicated the formation of two floristic
   groups (40\% dissimilarity), which was corroborated by TWINSPAN and ISA.
   The regenerating area after 30 years of abandonment showed similar
   species diversity as did the preserved area; however, floristic
   composition, species richness, density, and basal area did not recover.
   The similarity in diameter distributions between areas indicated that
   the abandoned area is recovering its regenerative capability.},

Abstract = {The competitive influence of the root system of the exotic grass
   Urochloa brizantha and the widespread forb Leonotis nepetifolia on the
   emergence, survival and early growth of the seedlings of eight tropical
   heliophilous herbaceous species, six early-successional woody species
   and five late-successional woody species from Brazil, grown in
   3500-cm(3) pots and in greenhouse without light restriction were
   assessed. The density of fine-root systems produced by the forb and the
   grass in pots were 6.8 cm cm(-3) soil and 48.1 cm cm(-3) soil,
   respectively. Seedlings survival of the heliophilous herbaceous,
   early-and late-successional woody species were 86\%, 70\% and 100\% in
   presence of the forb root system and 12\%, 14\% and 100\% in competition
   with grass root system, respectively. The competitive pressure applied
   by the grass root system on seedling growth of the heliophilous
   herbaceous, early-and late-successional woody species were 2.4, 1.9 and
   1.4 times greater than the forb root system. Total root length of the
   heliophilous herbaceous, early-and late-successional woody species grown
   without competitors were 13, 33 and 5 times greater than in competition
   with forb, and were 66, 54 and 6 times greater than in competition with
   grass root system, respectively. The averages of fine-root diameter of
   plants grown without competitors were 209 mu m for the heliophilous
   herbaceous, 281 mu m for early-successional trees and 382 mu m for
   late-successional trees. The root system of the forb did not avoid
   seedling establishment of most plant species, but the grass root system
   hampered more the establishment of heliophilous herbaceous and
   early-successional woody species than the seedling establishment of
   late-successional woody species. The different density of root systems
   produced in soil by the forb and the grass, and the distinct root traits
   (e.g. root diameter and root tissue density) of the early-and
   late-successional plant species can explain the differences in the
   establishment of seedlings of plant species belonging to different
   groups of tropical succession when exposed to below-ground competition.},

Abstract = {Tropical forest management has a potential role in forest conservation
   if it is sustainable. This study of a forest under management in
   Bolivian Amazonia strongly suggests that the management project is not
   sustainable and that no potential changes in management would be likely
   to make it so. In a 216.41 ha harvested area, 278 commercial trees from
   10 families, 15 genera, and 15 species were measured. The density of
   commercial species with diameter at breast height (DBH) >= 50 cm was
   1.28 trees ha(-1), and the harvestable commercial volume was 12.40 m(3)
   ha(-1). Due to market restrictions, the actual amounts harvested were
   much lower: 96 trees were harvested with commercial boles totaling 2.7
   m(3) ha(-1). Of the total impact on biomass and carbon (above- and
   belowground), the logs removed from the area represented only 13.4\%,
   while 86.6\% was from losses in the forest as follows: 14.5\% from the
   stumps, crowns, and roots of harvested trees (DBH >= 50 cm) plus 72.1\%
   from the trees (DBH >= 10 cm) in the forest lost to roads, log landings,
   and skid tracks and the gap openings caused by felling the harvested
   trees. The estimated expenses exceeded the gross revenue of the
   management company (USD 519.15 ha(-1)), a fact confirmed by the
   company's subsequent bankruptcy. The project's low harvest intensity
   reduces the environmental impact per hectare but increases the impact
   per cubic meter of wood harvested because producing a given volume of
   wood requires disturbing a larger area and because more kilometers of
   access roads and skid tracks have to be installed to extract a given
   volume of wood. Because many costs are fixed regardless of harvest
   intensity, small harvest volume can render such projects financially
   unfeasible, increasing the likelihood that they will be abandoned and
   not provide long-term ``sustainable{''} forest protection. However, this
   does not mean that higher harvest intensity results in sustainability,
   as other constraints apply to high-intensity projects. We conclude that
   conservation alternatives to maintain the forest would be more
   beneficial than management for timber.},

Abstract = {Technical and scientific information on medium-term effects of

   growing stocks are hardly available. To mitigate uncertainties about
   these effects our study aimed to answer the following question: ``What
   is the medium-term effect of post-harvest silvicultural treatments on
   mortality, growth, and the structure of commercial tree species in
   canopy logging gaps under tending and enrichment planting?{''} we study
   individuals planted and naturally regenerated in 72 logging gaps opened
   tree felling during reduced-impact logging among different silvicultural
   treatments: (1) natural regeneration tending (TNER); (2) enrichment
   planting in logging gaps (EP1); (3) enrichment planting in logging gaps
   previously cleaned of harvesting residuals (EP2). Mortality increased
   through time, EP1 presented the highest mortality rates of all
   treatments in the first, sixth and 11th year, TNER had the lowest at the
   same period. TNER and EP2 presented the highest basal area and EP2 the
   highest periodic annual increment. Effects of the silvicultural
   treatment TNER were positive, since it presented the highest survival
   and a high mean basal area of the initial trees. The medium-term effects
   of silvicultural treatments applied over individuals of commercial trees
   in logging gaps indicate higher survival and growth that reflected in
   the structure of treated individuals when compared to standard
   procedures of reduced impact-logging, these results bring positive
   outcomes to reach more sustainable future cutting cycles in the

Journal = {BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY},
Year = {2004},
Volume = {5},
Number = {6},
Pages = {567-580},
Abstract = {This study evaluates the N-15 natural abundance method for estimating
   biologicalnitrogen fixation (BNF) in 12 secondary and five primary
   forest sites in central Amazonia. Investigations were based on spatially
   systematic sampling of 20 potentially N-2-fixing legume tree and liana
   species, and of a range of differing references representing the
   `soil-derived nitrogen'.
   The absence of systematic differences in the delta(15)N-signals of
   potential N-2-fixers and reference plants resulted in many invalid \%
   Ndfa-estimates (i.e., the proportion of foliar N derived from BNF).
   Whereas the \% Ndfa-estimates based on non-legumes were randomly
   distributed around zero, the use of non-N-2-fixing legumes resulted in
   Largely positive \% Ndfa-estimates. Grouping of reference species into
   species types was a valid strategy to reduce the risk of atypical
   values. Leaf litter was an inadequate measure of soil-derived nitrogen.
   The impact of the B-value was low or moderate at best, the percentage of
   negative \% Ndfa-estimates remained unaltered. The manner of
   individually pairing putative N2-fixers with reference plants only
   marginally affected the \% Ndfa-estimates, the assumption of an overall,
   site mean reference delta(15)N-signal was sufficient.
   Since legumes were aggregated in clusters, BNF locally affected the
   surrounding soil nitrogen in secondary regrowth. Negative correlations
   between the vegetation shares of potential N-2-fixers and leaf litter
   delta(15) N-signals indicate N-15-dilution from the input side.
   Interpolated reference plant 815 N-signals appear low in the
   surroundings of legume clusters in some of the older regrowth sites,
   confirming such N-15-dilution.
   We conclude that, with our current state of knowledge, the N-15 natural
   abundance method fails to quantitatively estimate BNF in heterogeneous
   forests. Future research should focus on the search for a more direct
   measure of the plant-available delta(15)N-signal of the soil, as well as
   on plant-soil interactions and the resulting small-scale isotopic
   heterogeneity. (C) 2004 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Post-fire forestry management improves fruit weight and seed set in
   forest coppices dominated by Arbutus unedo L.},
Journal = {FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {345},
Pages = {65-72},
Month = {JUN 1},
Abstract = {In Mediterranean ecosystems, post-fire forestry management practices are
   often used to improve forest structure and to reduce the risk of fire in
   coppices of resprouting species. Such practices enhance tree growth
   (i.e., height), probably because they release resources. On the one
   hand, resource release may stimulate reproduction. On the other hand,
   tree species that are regenerating after a fire may already face a delay
   in reproduction, and this delay may be lengthened if species mainly
   invest these additional resources in growth. Within this theoretical
   framework, it is poorly understood how different forest management
   practices affect the reproductive abilities of forest species. In this
   study, we analyzed the effect of two post-fire forestry treatments
   (selective thinning of resprouts and selective thinning of resprouts
   plus understory clearing) on a Mediterranean coppice dominated by the
   resprouter species Arbutus unedo L.; in particular, we examined how the
   treatments affected this species' reproductive ability (flower and fruit
   production at the tree and stand level, as well as fruit
   characteristics). Our results show that the treatments had no effects on
   the number of flowers and mature fruits per individual. Meanwhile,
   mature fruit dry mass and seed set were greater in plots that had been
   both thinned and cleared than in control plots and plots that had only
   been thinned. This pattern was reversed for seed abortion rate: it was
   lower in plots that had been thinned and cleared. The dry mass of
   developed seeds did not differ among treatments. At the stand level, the
   percentage of strawberry trees that flowered, the percentage of
   strawberry trees that bore fruit, the dry biomass of mature fruits per
   hectare, and the number of developed seeds per hectare were not affected
   by these treatments. Other studies have shown that these two forest
   management practices can improve the vertical and horizontal structure
   of A. unedo coppices that are regenerating post fire; this study
   demonstrates that selective thinning does not modify the species'
   reproductive success and, such practice when combined with understory
   clearing might enhance it. Consequently, these forestry practices might
   ensure the natural regeneration of populations of this species, as well
   as the availability of food for local fauna. It is thus highly
   recommended that such practices be used to manage coppices dominated by
   resprouter species following fire, especially in situations where the
   growth of the forest canopy has stagnated and/or reproduction of forest
   species has been delayed. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The relative importance of sexual reproduction (seed) and sprouting as
   sources for regeneration in Brazilian Atlantic Forest was evaluated in
   three different successional forest stages: young forest, immature
   forest, and late-successional forest. Young plants (10-100 cm tall) of
   tree species were classified into the following categories: (1)
   seedlings that are nonsprouting-plants that originated through sexual
   reproduction as seeds; (2) stem base sprouting-plants that sprouted at
   the base of an existing plant; and (3) underground stem sprouting-plants
   that sprouted from subterranean stems of an existing plant. A total of
   1,030 individuals of 48 species were collected. Underground stem
   sprouting is the rarest form of propagation, with stem base sprouting
   somewhat more common and possibly associated with recovery of damaged
   parts. The greatest contribution to regeneration was due to seeds: 92\%
   of the individuals counted in 67\% of the plant species. However, 13
   species were ``facultative{''} sprouters as seedlings and sprouters were
   observed in this group. The three forest ages differed in the proportion
   of regeneration strategies; in immature forest, sprouting was more
   common (15\%) than in young (7\%) and late-successional (3\%; p < 0.05)
   forest. In these three forest stages, germinating seeds are the major
   source of new plants; although sprouting as a reproductive strategy is
   rare, it is related to recovery after damage of an already existing
   plant and may be due to previous land use history (agriculture) and low
   soil fertility. Restoration using natural regeneration should consider
   these factors to understand seed arrival as seed is the main source of
   regeneration.},

Abstract = {The present study aims to assess the dynamics of forest cover in
   Crissiumal-RS, through remote sensing techniques. From the digital
   classification of satellite images from Landsat 5 TM sensor, between
   1988 and 2008 were generated thematic maps use and land cover on the
   respective dates. These maps were later crossed through the Space for
   GIS Algebraic Language (LEGAL), which allowed determination of the
   following processes: maintaining forest, forest regeneration and
   deforestation. Among the main results is the increase in forest cover in
   4756.33 ha and also the occurrence of 1508.04 ha of deforestation at the
   end of the period. The increase in forest cover may be combined with
   declining rural population and the abandonment of areas previously
   occupied by agriculture to comply with the law.},

Journal = {POPULATION AND ENVIRONMENT},

Abstract = {The Household Life Cycle framework relates family demographic processes
   to land use-cover change, but also revealed limitations. We propose
   several modifications, featuring a focus on extended families instead of
   single households, to broaden the applicability to land use systems. In
   the process, we pay particular attention to temporal dynamics and the
   spatial distribution of families concerning demographic processes, going
   beyond fertility to focus on population distribution. To evaluate the
   extended family model's explanatory value, we apply it to the
   Transamazon Highway region in Brazil. The analysis includes 330
   families, which are often multi-generational and multi-sited, based on
   data from 402 lots (1997/8-2005). We present models for forest,
   secondary succession, annual crops, perennials and pasture. Explanatory
   variables feature nine demographic factors with five others controlling
   for exogenous forces. The findings show strong effects for family
   dynamics and spatial distribution variables in many equations. Time on
   lot (cohort effect), the complexity of family structure (age effect) and
   social integration into urban fabric (spatial effect) are demographic
   processes that deserve further attention in land use studies.},

Journal = {PERSPECTIVES IN PLANT ECOLOGY EVOLUTION AND SYSTEMATICS},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {7},
Number = {4},

Abstract = {Mangrove forest structure is the result of interactions between species
   responses to abiotic stress factors, disturbance, dispersal and
   competition. The combination of abiotic conditions and disturbance
   history may determine the growth potential of the species, whereas
   dispersal, competition and external or biogenic changes in abiotic
   conditions may tune their succession. Even in forests with only a few
   species.. this set of factors can create multiple species compositions.
   For example, pure stands of the mancyrove Laguncularia are common in
   newly colonized areas, but they may evolve into mixed stands dominated
   by Rhizophora or Avicennia. We demonstrate such an evolution with a
   field study of mangroves established in abandoned rice fields. We use an
   individual-based simulation model to understand how species-dependent
   dispersal, growth rate and shade tolerance lead to the observed patterns
   in horizontal and vertical forest structure. We find that the initially
   dominating species will be gradually replaced in the canopy. This
   alteration cannot be explained exclusively by shade tolerance of the
   succeeding species. Rather, it is essential to assume that the height
   growth rate of the pioneer species slows down relative to those of the
   later species. A decrease in nutrient availability may be responsible
   for these relative changes in the growth rates of different species. (c)

Abstract = {Manipulation experiments can contribute to understand the ecological

   this nature. We evaluated the effects of the litter layer removal (RS)
   on the soil arthropod community in two abandoned plantations of Corymbia
   citriodora at different stages of the Atlantic Rainforest natural
   regeneration. Pitfall traps were randomly installed in plots (5 x 20 in)
   of RS and control (CT) in a 19-year old plantation (P19: less advanced
   stage of natural regeneration of Atlantic Rainforest species; higher
   contribution of eucalypt in litterfall) and a 42-year old plantation
   (P42: more advanced stage of regeneration; higher contribution of native
   species in litterfall), in rainy season and dry season at `Uniao
   Biological Reserve', RJ state, Brazil. RS inhibited the abundance of the
   most taxonomic groups, both in P19 and P42. In general, Diptera,
   Poduromorpha, Pseudoscorpionida, Symphypleona, and larvae of Coleoptera
   were the most negatively impacted groups by RS. In contrast. RS favored
   some other groups, principally Entomobryomorpha and Formicidae. Total
   richness, evenness and diversity were lower in RS in both plantations.
   However, this negative effect was stronger in the P19. where RS also
   decreased total abundance and average richness. The higher canopy
   closure probable minimized the negative impact of RS on the soil
   arthropods in P42.},

Abstract = {ABSTARCT Leaf traits are analyzed as essential drivers for the
   evolutionary and ecological role of plant defense mechanisms. Plants
   show leaf trait variation as a response to the diverse environmental
   conditions, like different successional stages. Those variations can
   impact leaf herbivory rates and drive changes in the allocation of plant
   resources. In this study, we aimed at comparing the expression of leaf
   defenses in established plants over different successional stages in a
   tropical dry forest to understand how these defenses modify the
   plant-herbivore interactions based on herbivory rates. We analyzed
   physical leaf traits (specific leaf area, thickness, and density),
   nutrient content (N, P, and K), total phenolic compounds, and leaf
   herbivory, of the native tree species Aspidosperma pyrifolium and
   Cenostigma pyramidale, in early- and late-successional stage areas.
   Results showed that the plant investment in defenses varies according to
   the successional stage and that both species have similar defense
   strategies, confirming the resource availability hypothesis. Individuals
   from the early stage adopt a strategy to lower sclerophylly, higher
   nutrient content and less phenolic compounds, while the late-stage
   individuals showed an opposite behaviour. For both species in this
   study, the average percentage of leaf herbivory observed was 40\% higher
   in the early compared to the late-stage area. Our data indicate that
   plant defenses are tightly coupled to sclerophylly and investments in
   secondary metabolites, and the environmental conditions of different
   successional stage drive that plasticity in such leaf traits.},

Pages = {56-67},

Abstract = {We synthesize findings to date from the world's largest and
   longest-running experimental study of habitat fragmentation, located in
   central Amazonia. Over the past 32 years, Amazonian forest fragments
   ranging from 1 to 100 ha have experienced a wide array of ecological
   changes. Edge effects have been a dominant driver of fragment dynamics,
   strongly affecting forest microclimate, tree mortality, carbon storage,
   fauna, and other aspects of fragment ecology. However, edge-effect
   intensity varies markedly in space and time, and is influenced by
   factors such as edge age, the number of nearby edges, and the adjoining
   matrix of modified vegetation surrounding fragments. In our study area,
   the matrix has changed markedly over the course of the study (evolving
   from large cattle pastures to mosaics of abandoned pasture and regrowth
   forest) and this in turn has strongly influenced fragment dynamics and
   faunal persistence. Rare weather events, especially windstorms and
   droughts, have further altered fragment ecology. In general, populations
   and communities of species in fragments are hyperdynamic relative to
   nearby intact forest. Some edge and fragment-isolation effects have
   declined with a partial recovery of secondary forests around fragments,
   but other changes: such as altered patterns of tree recruitment, are
   ongoing. Fragments are highly sensitive to external vicissitudes, and
   even small changes in local land-management practices may drive
   fragmented ecosystems in markedly different directions. The effects of
   fragmentation are likely to interact synergistically with other
   anthropogenic threats such as logging, hunting, and especially fire,
   creating an even greater peril for the Amazonian biota. Crown Copyright

Abstract = {Fipronil is an insecticide used for termite control in forest

   naturally regenerating secondary forest and the parent native Brazilian
   savanna) at three different times (90 days before and 90 and 180 days
   following) clonal seedling planting. A total of 53 termites species
   belongs to families Termitidae and Rhinotermitidae were collected. The
   mean richness of termite species differed significantly among the
   treatments and times. Grass feedings showed the highest overall richness
   in the plot under natural regeneration 90 days before planting. Soil
   feedings had higher richness in the control treatment (native savanna)
   and in the plot under regeneration at 180 days after planting. No
   significant differences in richness of wood feedings termites were
   detected in any comparison. Termite assemblage composition in the new

Journal = {FRONTIERS IN FORESTS AND GLOBAL CHANGE},

Volume = {5},
Month = {NOV 16},
Abstract = {Knowing soil indicators during forest restoration is essentially better
   for understanding the recovery of ecosystem functions for water
   conservation. The aim of this study is to assess seasonal changes in
   hydrological properties of sandy soils subjected to passive restoration
   over 8 (F8), 11 (F11), and 46 (F46) years in the Cerrado. The soils
   assessed herein have the same land use history and climate conditions.
   Soil density (SD), moisture (SM), organic matter (SOM), resistance to
   penetration (SRP), infiltration rate (IR), and soil conductivity (K)
   were measured for 12 months, and a repellency index (RI) was obtained in
   the dry season. Some annual soil hydrological property differences based
   on passive restoration sites were observed, but differences in other
   properties were only noticed through seasonal analyses. Higher SM, IR,
   and K values were recorded in the rainy season, and higher SRP values
   were observed in the dry season. IR was approximately fourfold higher in
   F8 and threefold higher in F11 and F46 in the rainy season than in the
   dry season. IR was higher in the oldest restoration site and lower (by
   over 60\%) in the youngest restoration site, which also showed higher
   RI. Thus, significant differences in several hydrological soil
   properties and forest restoration soils subjected to the assessed
   chrono-sequence helped to confirm the study hypothesis, namely: these
   properties are influenced by forest age and are a warning against
   deforestation and climate change scenarios. The recovery of hydrological
   properties can be a slow process, much slower than deforestation, and
   this can have severe implications because soil water inflow is related
   to groundwater maintenance. Therefore, improvement of hydrological
   properties can help to develop sustainable land management and better
   and more efficient soil conservation strategies for sites undergoing
   passive restoration such as the Cerrado.},

Abstract = {Regeneration of Araucaria angustifolia in three physiognomies of a Mixed
   Ombrophilous Forest fragment. It is presented the results of a sudy that
   evaluated the population structure, dynamics of regeneration, and the
   influence of biotic and abiotic factors over mortality, recruiting and
   growth of Araucaria angustifolia (Bertol.) Kuntze. The study was
   conducted in three phytophysiognomies of Mixed Ombrophilous Forest (Mun.
   Sao Joao do Triunfo-PR; 25 degrees 34' S; 50 degrees 05' W);
   representative of distinct successional stages classified according to
   the intensity of canopy covered by Araucarias. Initially a stable
   structure (inverted-J) was detected in all three samples surveyed, with
   high potentials and rates of regeneration. The subsequent monitoring
   confirmed this pattern, with high seedling survival and ingress rates
   being evidenced. A positive relation between the distinct canopy
   coverings and the natural regeneration rates registered was not
   detected. However, the populations presented themselves differently when
   referring to density, mortality and survival, being those determined by
   a complex web of interactions with the fauna within this ecosystem.
   Different from older studies, this work emphasizes the existence of a
   great potential of regeneration for Araucarias inside forests, once the
   limits of seed harvesting are respected, a non-wood forest product which

Title = {Coexistence of forest and savanna in an Amazonian area from a geological

Abstract = {Question: How can the coexistence of savanna and forest in Amazonian
   areas with relatively uniform climates be explained?
   Location: Eastern Marajo Island, northeast Amazonia, Brazil.
   Methods: The study integrated floristic analysis, terrain morphology,
   sedimentology and delta C-13 of soil organic matter. Floristic analysis
   involved rapid ecological assessment of 33 sites, determination of
   occurrence, specific richness, hierarchical distribution and matrix of
   floristic similarity between paired vegetation types. Terrain
   characterization was based on analysis of Landsat images using 4(R),
   5(G) and 7(B) composition and digital elevation model (DEM).
   Sedimentology involved field descriptions of surface and core sediments.
   Finally, radiocarbon dating and analysis of delta C-13 of soil profile
   organic matter and natural ecotone forest-savanna was undertaken.
   Results: Slight tectonic subsidence in eastern Marajo Island favours
   seasonal flooding, making it unsuitable for forest growth. However, this
   area displays slightly convex-up, sinuous morphologies related to
   paleochannels, covered by forest. Terra-firme lowland forests are
   expanding from west to east, preferentially occupying paleochannels and
   replacing savanna. Slack, running water during channel abandonment leads
   to disappearance of varzea/gallery forest at channel margins.
   Long-abandoned channels sustain continuous terra-firme forests, because
   of longer times for more species to establish. Recently abandoned
   channels have had less time to become sites for widespread tree
   development, and are either not vegetated or covered by savanna.
   Conclusion: Landforms in eastern Marajo Island reflect changes in the
   physical environment due to reactivation of tectonic faults during the
   latest Quaternary. This promoted a dynamic history of channel
   abandonment, which controlled a set of interrelated parameters (soil
   type, topography, hydrology) that determined species location. Inclusion
   of a geological perspective for paleoenvironmental reconstruction can
   increase understanding of plant distribution in Amazonia.},

   meta-analysis},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {13},
Number = {12},
Month = {DEC 27},
Abstract = {To reverse the effects of deforestation, tropical areas have expanded
   restoration efforts in recent years. As ecological restoration
   positively affects the structure and function of degraded ecosystems,
   understanding to what extent restoration recovers ecosystem services
   (ES) is an important step in directing large-scale restoration actions.
   We evaluated the effect of restoration in increasing the provision of ES
   in tropical forests. We performed a global meta-analysis of ecological
   indicators of the ES provided in restored areas, degraded areas and
   reference ecosystems. We tested for the effects of different restoration
   strategies, different types of degradation and for the effects of
   restoration over time. Overall, restoration actions contributed to a
   significant increase in levels of ecological indicators of ES (carbon
   pool, soil attributes and biodiversity protection) compared to disturbed
   areas. Among the restoration strategies, the natural regeneration was
   the most effective. Biodiversity protection and carbon recovered better
   than soil attributes. All other restoration strategies recovered ES to a
   substantially lesser degree, and reforestation with exotics decreased
   the ES of areas degraded by agriculture. In areas degraded by pasture,
   restoration was more effective in recovering the biodiversity
   protection, whereas in areas degraded by agriculture, the restoration
   recovered mainly the carbon pool. Our results show that by choosing the
   correct strategy, restoration can recover much of the ES lost by the
   degradation of tropical forests. These results should be considered for
   large-scale conservation and management efforts for this biome.},

Journal = {CONSERVATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {34},
Number = {1},
Pages = {148-157},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Offset schemes help avoid or revert habitat loss through protection of
   existing habitat (avoided deforestation), through the restoration of
   degraded areas (natural regrowth), or both. The spatial scale of an
   offset scheme may influence which of these 2 outcomes is favored and is
   an important aspect of the scheme's design. However, how spatial scale
   influences the trade-offs between the preservation of existing habitat
   and restoration of degraded areas is poorly understood. We used the
   largest forest offset scheme in the world, which is part of the
   Brazilian Forest Code, to explore how implementation at different
   spatial scales may affect the outcome in terms of the area of avoided
   deforestation and area of regrowth. We employed a numerical simulation
   of trade between buyers (i.e., those who need to offset past
   deforestation) and sellers (i.e., landowners with exceeding native
   vegetation) in the Brazilian Amazon to estimate potential avoided
   deforestation and regrowth at different spatial scales of
   implementation. Allowing offsets over large spatial scales led to an
   area of avoided deforestation 12 times greater than regrowth, whereas
   restricting offsets to small spatial scales led to an area of regrowth
   twice as large as avoided deforestation. The greatest total area
   (avoided deforestation and regrowth combined) was conserved when the
   spatial scale of the scheme was small, especially in locations that were
   highly deforested. To maximize conservation gains from avoided
   deforestation and regrowth, the design of the Brazilian forest-offset
   scheme should focus on restricting the spatial scale in which offsets
   occur. Such a strategy could help ensure conservation benefits are
   localized and promote the recovery of degraded areas in the most
   threatened forest landscapes.},

Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {906},
Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {Ecosystem restoration strategies vary widely in the techniques applied
   and ecological contexts. We conducted a meta-analysis to evaluate how
   restoration success varies across socio-ecological contexts, taxonomic
   groups and biomes. Restoration success is quantified as the percentage
   of each ecological metric value attained in the restoration site
   compared to the reference systems. We show that restoration success is
   different for plants, animals, and soils and across ecological
   indicators. Abundance of individuals is easier to restore than carbon
   stocks, which are easier than species diversity. However, abundance may
   be a poor indicator of ecosystem recovery because there is no
   unidirectional trend over time, and abundance often fails to distinguish
   restored from degraded areas. We also found that carbon stocks in the
   soil and in the vegetation are restored at analogous paces, but the
   recovery of soil carbon stocks is less variable than plant stocks across
   sites. Our results demonstrate that different restoration techniques are
   effective in recovering diversity and carbon stocks, but assisted
   natural regeneration showed a slightly higher success compared to other
   strategies. However, there is a considerable difficulty in restoring
   converted and degraded areas to achieve conditions similar to the
   original ecosystems. It is critical and timely to investigate benefits
   and effectiveness of ecosystem restoration techniques to biodiversity
   and carbon recovery different ecosystem types to improve the restoration
   effectiveness.},

Abstract = {Secondary forests promote an increased abundance of leaf-cutting ants
   (LCA) but the consequences on forest dynamics have been poorly
   addressed. Here we examine seedling assemblage attributes, seed
   germination and seedling survival across foraging zones of Atta
   cephalotes colonies inhabiting 15 second-growth patches (25-47 y old) of
   Atlantic forest. Seeds and seedlings were monitored within foraging
   zones and control sites over 1 y, including spots around ant nests.
   Overall, 1862 seedlings from 108 plant species were recorded. Seedling
   density decreased by 53\% in foraging-zone plots (3.31 +/- 0.23
   seedlings m(-2)) when compared with control plots (7.02 +/- 0.44
   seedlings m(-2)) and a similar decrease was observed for species
   richness. Ant-induced alterations in the seedling assemblage were
   further indicated by segregation between foraging-zone and control plots
   (NMDS), habitat effects on species similarity (ANOSIM), and indicator
   tree species associated with control plots. While seed germination and
   seedling survivorship were uncorrelated to either nest distance or age
   of second-growth stands (with the exception of Tapirira guianensis),
   defoliation by LCAs was a significant cause of seedling mortality. Our
   results suggest that LCAs interfere with successional trajectories of
   Atlantic forest as foraging zones filter seedling establishment,
   supporting less-dense, impoverished and convergent seedling assemblages.},

Abstract = {Forest plantations with Toona ciliata are presented as economically
   viable thanks to the suitability of their wood for high-quality niche
   products. However, this study verifies whether investment projects in T.
   ciliata plantations are economically viable with the incorporation of
   managerial flexibility. We apply technical-economic coefficients from T.
   ciliata forest plantations over a 15-year planning horizon, considering
   the investment project as an underlying asset and the price of wood as
   the only source of uncertainty. Using the Monte Carlo method, we model
   uncertainty to obtain project volatility, so that, using the Real Option
   Approach, managerial flexibility for deferral, expansion and abandonment
   is added to the underlying assets. Based on the traditional economic
   valuation methodology, we obtained a static net present value of USD
   5,075, which reflects the economic viability of the investment project
   in T. ciliata forest plantations. Due to the uncertainty arising from
   timber prices, project volatility was 131.7\%. Afterwards, it was found
   that incorporating the deferral and abandonment options added a premium
   of USD 2,147 to the value of the project, redirecting it towards an
   expanded net present value of USD 7,223. Incorporation of the real
   deferral and abandonment options provides flexibility and support for
   the decision-making process in the management of T. ciliata forest
   plantations, resulting in a 42.3\% increase in the value of the

   commonly suggested to enable FLR implementation. We identified three
   domains and 12 main associated principles-(i) Project management and

Abstract = {We analyzed leaf functional traits, chemical defenses and their effects
   on herbivory in three plant species that occur at two contrasting
   successional stages: mature and secondary forests in Mexico. In each
   successional stage, 15 individuals of Cordia elaeagnoides, C. alliodora
   and Achatocarpus gracilis were selected to analyze physical and chemical
   defenses and herbivory. Chlorophyll content, leaf thickness, leaf water
   content and leaf fresh mass were higher in mature forests, whereas SLA
   was higher in secondary forests, partially supporting the prediction
   that leaf traits vary from conservative to acquisitive along the leaf
   economics spectrum during succession. Content of secondary compounds did
   not show a consistent pattern among successional stages, but a
   relatively consistent trend was observed for C. elaeagnoides and A.
   gracilis, which exhibited higher levels of phenols and flavonoids in
   mature forests. Herbivory was higher in secondary than in mature forests
   for Cordia species, but the opposite pattern was found for A. gracilis.
   These results contradict the predictions of the resource availability
   hypothesis for tropical dry plant species, which state that
   resource-conservative plants in secondary forests invest more in
   chemical defenses and have less herbivore damage than
   resource-acquisitive plants in mature forests. Such idiosyncratic
   responses make it difficult to use a single hypothesis to predict plant
   defense and herbivory variations along environmental gradients at both
   intra- and interspecific levels. Considering the current intensity of
   human disturbance in forests, further studies are necessary to evaluate
   the impacts of changes in leaf functional traits on plant fitness during
   succession in the tropics.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {217},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The palm Syagrus coronata is a key non-timber forest products (NTFP)
   resource for the livelihood and income of people and is the main food
   item of the threatened endemic Lear's Macaw (Anadorhynchus leari) in
   semi-arid Brazil. To contribute to the planning conservation and
   management of this resource, we assessed how environmental and
   anthropogenic factors affect the natural regeneration and population
   structure of S. coronata and identified the relative importance of these
   factors in the abundance of life stages. We found that (1) recruitment
   failure occurs mostly in populations in agricultural and intensive
   grazing areas; (2) regeneration density was positively associated with
   the density of reproductive plants; and (3) current leaf or fruit
   harvesting levels were not detected to affect population density and
   recruitment. Populations subject to chronic anthropogenic disturbance,
   which lead to poor natural regeneration and recruitment bottlenecks, are
   likely to become locally extinct. Although populations of S. coronata
   are locally threatened, the persistence of the species in the landscape
   is currently ensured by its management and protection in different land
   uses by local populations that have this species as an important source
   of food and financial resources.},

Title = {Diversity of small mammals on the early second commercial cycle of
   Eucalyptus plantations in southeast Brazil},
Journal = {FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {489},
Month = {JUN 1},
Abstract = {In this study we surveyed small mammals on a silvicultural landscape
   during the early second 7-year commercial cycle of Eucalyptus
   plantations in southeast Brazil. To do so we used the same method
   (pitfall traps) and part of the same sampling units used by a previous
   study during the early first commercial cycle. Our results suggest that
   Eucalyptus plantations are used as habitat by part of the original
   assemblage of small mammals along their commercial cycles. Four new
   species were detected on the second cycle but three were only detected
   on the first. In both cycles Eucalyptus plantations presented smaller
   abundance of small mammals than native vegetation and abandoned pastures
   around. Oligoryzomys nigripes (a species from the Atlantic forest)
   replaces O. flavescens and Calomys tener (species from Cerrado) from the
   first to the second commercial cycle. Species richness of the landscape
   matrix tend to remain lower than the native vegetation and abandoned
   pastures on the early second commercial cycle. Similarly to the first
   cycle, the species that use Eucalyptus plantations are not affected by
   the distance to the border of the conservation areas (i.e., native
   vegetation and abandoned pastures). The land sharing approach of the
   silvicultural sector in Brazil apparently prevented a higher small
   mammal species local extinction in relation to a former matrix of
   pastures. This provides a relevant conservation value to local
   silvicultural landscapes due to the role of small mammals in local
   trophic network.},

   Brazil},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {13},
Month = {JUN 24},
Abstract = {Plants emit a broad number of Biogenic Volatile Organic Compounds
   (BVOCs) that can impact urban ozone (O-3) production. Conversely, the
   O-3 is a phytotoxic pollutant that causes unknown alterations in BVOC
   emissions from native plants. In this sense, here, we characterized the
   constitutive and O-3-induced BVOCs for two (2dO(3)) and four (4dO(3))
   days of exposure (O-3 dose 80 ppb) and evaluated the O-3 response by
   histochemical techniques to detect programmed cell death (PCD) and
   hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in three Brazilian native species. Croton
   floribundus Spreng, Astronium graveolens Jacq, and Piptadenia
   gonoacantha (Mart.) JF Macbr, from different groups of ecological
   succession (acquisitive and conservative), different carbon-saving
   defense strategies, and specific BVOC emissions. The three species
   emitted a very diverse BVOC composition: monoterpenes (MON),
   sesquiterpenes (SEQ), green leaf volatiles (GLV), and other compounds
   (OTC). C. floribundus is more acquisitive than A. graveolens. Their most
   representative BVOCs were methyl salicylate-MeSA (OTC), (Z) 3-hexenal,
   and (E)-2-hexenal (GLV), gamma-elemene and (-)-beta-bourbonene (SEQ)
   beta-phellandrene and D-limonene (MON), while in A. graveolens were
   nonanal and decanal (OTC), and alpha-pinene (MON). Piptadenia
   gonoachanta is more conservative, and the BVOC blend was limited to MeSA
   (OTC), (E)-2-hexenal (GLV), and beta-Phellandrene (MON). The O-3
   affected BVOCs and histochemical traits of the three species in
   different ways. Croton floribundus was the most O-3 tolerant species and
   considered as an SEQ emitter. It efficiently reacted to O-3 stress after
   2dO(3,) verified by a high alteration of BVOC emission, the emergence of
   the compounds such as alpha-Ionone and trans-ss-Ionone, and the absence
   of H2O2 detection. On the contrary, A. graveolens, a MON-emitter, was
   affected by 2dO(3) and 4dO(3), showing increasing emissions of
   alpha-pinene and beta-myrcene, (MON), gamma-muurolene and beta-cadinene
   (SEQ) and H2O2 accumulation. Piptadenia gonoachanta was the most
   sensitive and did not respond to BVOCs emission, but PCD and H2O2 were
   highly evidenced. Our results indicate that the BVOC blend emission,
   combined with histochemical observations, is a powerful tool to confirm
   the species' tolerance to O-3. Furthermore, our findings suggest that
   BVOC emission is a trade-off associated with different resource
   strategies of species indicated by the changes in the quality and
   quantity of BVOC emission for each species.},

Volume = {44},

Abstract = {Genetic implications of natural and artificial regeneration following
   three regeneration methods (group selection, shelterwood, and clearcut)
   were investigated in coastal Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii var.
   menziesii {[}Mirb.] France) using genetic markers (17 allozyme loci). In
   general, harvesting followed by either natural or artificial
   regeneration resulted in offspring populations little altered from those
   in the previous generation. Cutting the smallest trees to form
   shelterwoods, however, resulted in the removal of rare, presumably
   deleterious, alleles, such that slightly fewer alleles per locus were
   observed among residual trees (2.76) and natural regeneration (2.75)
   than found in uncut (control) stands (2.86). Thus, although the
   shelterwood regime appears quite compatible with gene conservation, it
   would be best to leave parent trees of a range of sizes in shelterwoods
   designated as gene conservation reserves, in order to maximize the
   number of alleles (regardless of current adaptive value) in naturally
   regenerated offspring. Seedling stocks used for artificial regeneration
   in clearcut, shelterwood, and group selection stands (7 total) had
   significantly greater levels of genetic diversity, on average, than
   found in natural regeneration. This is probably because the seeds used
   in artificial seedling stocks came from many wild stands and thus,
   sampled more diversity than found in single populations.},

   of one hectare were used, with 16 plots (20 x 20 m) each, where the
   species were sampled in three size classes. The size class II (SC II
   -diameter at breast height (DBH) >= 9.55 cm) was sampled in 96 plots,
   the SC I (4.8 <= DBH < 9.55 cm) in 36 subplots of 10 x 10 m, and the
   established natural regeneration (ENR) (1 <= DBH < 4.8 cm) in 36 cells
   of 3.16 x 3.16 m. The seedling bank (SB -height >= 30 cm and DBH < 1
   cm), the seed rain (SR) and the soil seed bank (SSB) were sampled in all
   plots of 20 x 20 m. The data were analysed by taking into account all
   the different vegetation groups together and separately for each cluster
   identified in a previous study. For SC II, the frequency distribution of
   DBH was analysed combined with the analysis of absolute density and
   frequency for all life stages (SR, SSB, SB, ENR, SC I and SC II). The
   results indicated high variability in density of these species among the
   different life stages and environmental conditions. Araucaria
   angustifolia presented gaps in the regeneration process in areas that
   had low past disturbance, not showing the ``reverse-J{''} distribution
   (SC II) and with lower regeneration capacity in relation to the other
   species (SR, SSB and SB). Ilex paraguariensis and Blepharocalyx
   salicifolius showed higher population stability in environment with low
   level of human interference (SC II). The first species demonstrated
   preference for soils with good drainage, while the second species for
   humid soils. Moreover, gaps in the regeneration process of different
   populations were detected, which changed according to environmental
   conditions and disturbance levels. Therefore, the results suggest the
   importance of taking into account the different vegetation groups, the
   species autecology and to apply possible interventions that aim to
   improve regeneration and balance the population dynamics of these
   species.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF SOILS AND SEDIMENTS},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 FEB 9},
Abstract = {PurposeLithic soils (with lithic contact up to 50 cm deep) are common in
   global drylands. Historically, have been little studied over time and
   the natural and anthropogenic factors that affect the storage of carbon
   (C) and nitrogen (N) in this soil group are little known.MethodsWe used
   118 lithic soil profiles to understand how climate (semi-arid and dry
   sub-humid), lithology, relief, and land-use (agriculture, pasture,
   secondary forest, and native forest) affect soil C and N stocks in
   drylands, northeastern Brazil.ResultsClimate did not affect C and N
   stocks in lithic soils. However, soils with sedimentary lithology
   showed, on average, 17.4 and 27.1\% less C and 20.5 and 38.2\% less N
   than soils under metamorphic and igneous lithology, respectively. Soils
   under wavy relief presented the highest C (30.5 +/- 16.9 Mg ha-1) and N
   (2.7 +/- 1.2 Mg ha-1) stocks, while those under flat relief presented
   the lowest values (19.6 +/- 16.3 Mg C ha-1 and 2.1 +/- 1.5 Mg N ha-1),
   because of more significant anthropic use in profiles under flat relief.
   In general, soils under pasture and agriculture showed, on average,
   73.6\% and 65.8\% less C than soils under native forest and the natural
   recovery of C and N stocks in soils (areas under natural regeneration)
   was limited, because of lithic contact close to the surface.ConclusionWe
   concluded that lithology, relief, and land use were the main factors

Abstract = {In the Eastern Amazon, abandoned and unproductive areas are widespread
   and normally found as a result of soil degradation. In this study we
   presented the following scientific question: Is it possible to improve
   the quality of soil physical and biological attributes of areas
   previously occupied by abandoned pastures with commercial plantation of
   the native species Dipteryx odorata? To respond this question, the
   objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of D. odorata
   plantations after abandoned pastures on the soil physical and biological
   attributes, using the soil from a successional forest in the
   municipality of Obidos, Eastern Amazon, Brazil, as a reference.
   Disturbed and undisturbed soil samples were collected from depths 0-10,
   10-20, and 20-40 cm to determine organic matter content, bulk density,
   macro-, micro-, and total porosity. Soil macrofauna was collected at
   depth 0-10 cm and visual evaluation of soil structure was also
   conducted. The plantation accumulated organic matter and presented
   higher density of the macrofauna orders Haplotaxida and Blattodea,
   suborder Isoptera, and promoted better soil structural quality. Results
   were similar to those of the reference forest and higher than those of
   abandoned pastures. The D. odorata plantation was therefore an effective
   alternative for forest recovery of degraded areas in the region.},

Abstract = {In Santa Catarina State, forest classification in successional stages is
   supported by the National Council of the Environment (CONAMA)
   Resolution. However, this classification presents several
   inconsistencies. This study aimed to evaluate the classification
   accuracy of three classifications schemes of successional stages
   proposed for the Subtropical Atlantic Evergreen Rainforest of the Santa
   Catarina State. All schemes are based on threshold values of mean
   height, mean diameter at breast height, and basal area to distinguish
   between stages. We used structural and diversity data from 207 sample
   plots within the Santa Catarina's State Subtropical Rainforest region to
   classify the respective stands according to the schemes. The
   classification accuracy of each scheme was evaluated through the
   application of linear discriminant analysis (LDA). We constructed a
   predictive equation using the results of the LDA, from the scheme that
   presented highest classification accuracy. The current classification
   (CONAMA Resolution) showed an average of 81.87\% of classification
   accuracy, while Scenario A presented 83.73\% and Scenario B 78.67\%.
   From Scenario A, we created a predictive equation based on structural
   and diversity variables. This equation may be used to classify other
   forest sites, constituting a new proposal for the secondary vegetation
   classification in Santa Catarina's State Subtropical Rainforest.},

Abstract = {The need to put into practice sustainable agricultural production

   land use to food production with the lowest impact on soil. This study
   evaluated soil quality, based on physical and chemical attributes, in
   agroforestry (AGF) and silvopastoral (SILVP) systems developed for
   large-scale food production. The study was carried out in the
   municipality of Itirapina, state of Sao Paulo, in two areas with AGF and
   SILVP system, compared to an area with a forest fragment and another
   with pasture in a Quartzipisamment Sand Neosol. The soil collections
   were carried out in the layers of 0.00-0.05, 0.05-0.10, 0.10-0.20, and
   0.20-0.40 m, where physical soil attributes were evaluated (total
   porosity, microporosity, and microporosity, density, mean diameter of
   aggregates) as well as chemical attributes (macro- and micronutrients),
   in addition to carbon and nitrogen storage. To interpret the data,
   Tukey's test was applied to compare means, and principal component
   analysis was used to better characterize the study environments. The
   results showed that agroforestry and silvopastoral systems developed for
   large-scale production are efficient in improving chemical and physical
   attributes that reflect on soil quality, especially in the superficial
   layers of the soil, overcoming pasture and the natural regeneration
   process. Carbon and nitrogen storage were the main variables that
   differentiated the production systems, highlighting the importance of
   the AGF and SILVP systems as more sustainable agricultural
   intensification strategies, even in soils of low agricultural
   suitability.},

Year = {2020},
Volume = {29},

Abstract = {In Amazonia, a growing body of studies has shown that rainforests were
   affected by human occupation in many areas during pre-Columbian times,
   inducing changes in their floristic compositions. The northern part of
   Amazonia, and in particular the Guiana Shield, is much less studied,
   although past human occupations have also been documented in this
   region. Therefore, the actual impact of pre-Columbian societies on
   Guianan forests is still poorly known. Here we explore 12 sites in the
   dense forest of Nouragues, central French Guiana, ranging from a priori
   non-anthropogenic to clearly anthropogenic, using an anthracological
   approach. Soil charcoals were radiocarbon dated to assess the chronology
   of the past human occupations, and identified to determine shifts in
   vegetation cover. Our results show that two main periods of occupation
   can be distinguished on several sites in the Nouragues area: a first one
   between ca. 1,300 and 1,000 calbpand a second one between ca. 600 and
   400 calbp. Charcoal identification reveals the presence of a secondary
   vegetation during this most recent period of occupation, as shown by the
   presence of pioneer and heliophilic taxa, suggesting that human
   activities induced and favored this kind of vegetation. The presence of
   valuable wood and edible species in the anthracological record could
   reflect selective exploitation of the former around dwelling areas and a
   concentration of the latter within anthropogenic sites. As shown by our
   anthracological results, all the sites which contained charcoal were
   once under forest cover, including those that are now covered by
   pseudo-bamboos or by liana forests. We therefore suggest that the type
   of human activity (e.g. dwelling or food production) may have had
   different impacts on the structure and composition of subsequent
   vegetation resulting either in anthropogenic forests or liana and
   pseudo-bamboo patches after land abandonment.},

Abstract = {Throughout the Amazon region, the age of forests regenerating on
   previously deforested land is determined, in part, by the periods of
   active land use prior to abandonment and the frequency of reclearance of
   regrowth, both of which can be quantified by comparing time-series of
   Landsat sensor data. Using these time-series of near annual data from
   1973-2011 for an area north of Manaus (in Amazonas state), from
   1984-2010 for south of Santarem (Parastate) and 1984-2011 near
   Machadinho d'Oeste (Rondonia state), the changes in the area of primary
   forest, non-forest and secondary forest were documented from which the
   age of regenerating forests, periods of active land use and the
   frequency of forest reclearance were derived. At Manaus, and at the end
   of the time-series, over 50\% of regenerating forests were older than 16
   years, whilst at Santarem and Machadinho d'Oeste, 57\% and 41\% of
   forests respectively were aged 6-15 years, with the remainder being
   mostly younger forests. These differences were attributed to the time
   since deforestation commenced but also the greater frequencies of
   reclearance of forests at the latter two sites with short periods of use
   in the intervening periods. The majority of clearance for agriculture
   was also found outside of protected areas. The study suggested that a)
   the history of clearance and land use should be taken into account when
   protecting deforested land for the purpose of restoring both tree
   species diversity and biomass through natural regeneration and b) a
   greater proportion of the forested landscape should be placed under
   protection, including areas of regrowth.},

   growth during the rainy season after dispersal of seeds. There were no
   remaining viable seeds of these species in the seedbank before seed
   dispersal. The average numbers of seeds after seed dispersal were 188

   radius around H. impetiginosus, and 5 seed m(-2) in a 20 m radius around
   A. cearensis. The distance of seed dispersal reached 30, 20, and 10 m
   for M. urundeuva, H. impetiginosus, and A. cearensis trees,
   respectively, due to differences in tree height, seed weight, forest
   density, and wind intensity. Seedling emergence was observed during 4
   (M. urundeuva) and 9 (H. impetiginosus and A. cearensis) weeks. High
   mortality predominated at the beginning and end of the rainy season for
   M. urundeuva and A. cearensis, respectively, while practically all H.
   impetiginosus seedlings survived. M. urundeuva showed the highest
   mortality but had higher number of established seedlings than the other
   species. Seedling survival peaked around 5 m from the tree base.

   to identify and estimate the extent of timber exploitation activities in
   areas of upland tropical rainforest in the Amazon region. The analysis

   polygons mapped annually and properly georeferenced, allows the
   estimation of the annual rate of selective logging, and also of the
   conversion of selectively logged areas into clear-cut areas or secondary
   succession, due to the abandonment of the area. Using linear spectral
   mixture techniques, an example of the spectral-textural characteristics
   transformation of the TM images is presented for the test-site Tapajos
   National Forest, Para State. In this section of the tropical forests,
   this practice of timber exploitation has been accomplished with legal
   support, through a governmental forest management plan. The spatial
   distribution of areas subject to selective logging provides subsidies to
   the environmental agencies responsible for the control and enforcement
   of the policies regarding the forest resources in Brazilian Amazon.},

Journal = {ACTA OECOLOGICA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {122},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Slash-and-burn agriculture is a common practice in dry forests
   worldwide. Understanding the relative importance of different
   regeneration mechanisms following this disturbance provides insights
   into forest regeneration dynamics and resilience. We assessed
   differences in structural components, the relative contribution of
   vegetative and sexual reproduction, and the taxonomic composition of
   woody assemblages among different habitats in a Brazilian Caatinga dry
   forest after slash-and-burn agriculture. We assessed vegetation
   parameters (i.e., basal area, height, species richness, and the
   frequency of each regeneration mechanism) in recently abandoned fields,
   regenerating forest stands and old-growth forest stands. Overall, trees
   originates from root suckers accounted for at least 40\% of the
   individuals, stems, and basal areas across the habitats. The structure
   of regenerating stands was similar to old-growth stands except for
   species composition, total number of roots, and number of primary roots.
   The aboveground basal area varied in total values, but not averages,
   among habitats, indicating a rapid recovery of aboveground biomass after
   slash-and-burn agriculture. Conversely, recently abandoned fields had
   higher belowground basal area and basal area of primary roots, revealing
   that the trees in these habitats emit more roots even with fewer
   individuals. There was a high degree of species turnover among the
   habitats, probably due to both species selection by farmers and
   environmental effects. Nevertheless, the dominant species presented both
   regeneration mechanisms across the habitats. Our findings thus show that
   the Caatinga dry forest regeneration considerably relies on the ability
   of woody plant species to emit root suckers in addition to sexual
   reproduction, which should be considered for better management practices
   as slash-and-burn agriculture is and will continue to be practiced.},

   biomes such as the Atlantic Forest, especially in degraded areas with
   past intensive land use, which usually present severe limiting
   conditions. The species must have high survival and growth, not only in
   the transition between germination and seedling but also between
   seedling and adult plant until allowing the establishment of a
   self-sustaining and renewable community. In order to reach this goal,
   restoration initiatives carried out in the Atlantic Forest have employed
   high-diversity plantings of tree species from different successional
   guilds. Notwithstanding, long-term silvicultural knowledge is scarce for
   the native species from this biome, and the effectiveness of these
   models is controversial. Our investigation has compared the survival and
   growth of species and guilds in high-diversity tree species plantings in
   areas with previous agricultural intensive use. The species and guilds
   were also compared with respect to seed mass since this parameter is
   pointed out as an indicator of high survival in early stages. Pioneer
   and secondary species did not present differences in survival and seed
   mass, although pioneers exhibited greater growth rate. The late
   successional (LS) species had lower survival and growth, and higher seed
   mass. Survival after 8 months and between 8-15 months after seedling
   planting was inversely correlated with seed mass (r(2) = 0.35 and r(2) =
   0.36, P < 0.001). On the other hand, survival after 8 months was
   correlated with relative growth rate (RGR) in the same periods of time
   (r(2) = 0.34, P < 0.001). Overall average survival was 41\% after 15
   months, with the survival of LS species at an average of 12\%. Data
   suggests that the inclusion of LS seedlings could impair the efficacy of
   restoration during early phases, at least in highly degraded areas.
   Equally, the inclusion of species with high seed mass should be
   considered with caution.},

Abstract = {The delineation of unique areas in biodiversity is crucial for
   conservation planning. However, identification of distinct biotas is a
   challenging task. In this study, we use an objective analytical process
   to test if bird and plant species composition of three different forest
   formation in the Atlantic forest Biome is sufficiently distinct to merit
   the recognition of ecoregions. We also evaluated how current climatic
   and spatial factors shape the distribution of plants and birds. Sampling
   localities were selected in three forest types of southern Brazil: mixed
   rain forest (MF), seasonal semi-deciduous forest (SF) and dense rain
   forest (DF). The point-centred quarter method and point counts were used
   to sample plants and birds respectively. Multivariate analyses were used
   to evaluate species composition, while the Rank Occupancy Abundance
   Profile was used to determine the association of bird species with each
   forest type. We used variation partitioning to determine which factors,
   that is climatic, spatial or tree species abundance (in the case of
   birds) better explained the distribution of plants and birds. A total of
   176 tree species and 270 bird species were recorded. The bird species
   composition was sufficiently distinct among the three forest types, but
   the plant species composition was only distinct between DF and MF.
   Moreover, 61\% of bird species were associated with only one forest
   type. This high association and the different species composition
   suggest that these forest types are sufficiently distinct to merit the
   recognition of ecoregions. Plant distribution was mainly affected by
   climatic variables, while bird distribution was mainly influenced by
   forest type and less so by climatic variables. Our data suggest that all
   three forest types should be conserved, but conservation strategies are
   urgent in MF where only 0.39\% of its original cover is under
   protection.},

Abstract = {Knowing the dynamics of the species natural populations is a strategy to
   improve its timber production and conservation, mainly through the
   effects caused by the reduced impact logging (RIL). Thus, the question
   is: what is the effect of RIL on the dynamics of Pseudopiptadenia
   suaveolens over time? The effect of RIL on the dynamics of P. suaveolens
   was evaluated based on survival, growth, recruitment, basal area and
   density of individuals >= 45 cm from Diameter to Breast Height (DBH at
   1.30 m from the ground) in a thirteen-year chronosequence. Five Annual
   Production Units (APU) were inventoried, where four were harvested in
   different years (2002; 2004; 2008 and 2010) and one not harvested. The
   highest mortality rate occurred at five (6.6\% year(-1)) and seven
   (5.2\% year(-1)) years after RIL. At eleven (2.4\% year(-1)) and
   thirteen (1.0 \% year(-1)) years, mortality rates did not differ
   significantly between themselves and in relation to the control area
   (not harvested). The recruitment rate was significantly higher seven
   years after logging (7.7\% year(-1)) when compared to the other years.
   In logged areas, trees with DBH >= 75 cm account for the majority of
   deaths, although there was no significant difference between diameter
   classes, which were minimally influenced by RIL. Mortality and growth
   rates of P. suaveolens by diametric class did not show significant
   difference, however, they were minimally influenced by the RIL.},

Abstract = {The objective was to evaluate the influence of environmental variables
   on the ant fauna, in cultivated areas and in a native forest fragment.
   The data were collected in the municipality of Seropedica, Rio de
   Janeiro state, in the rainy and dry seasons, in a banana plantation
   (Musa pariadisiaca L.), an agroforest, a coffee plantation (Coffea
   conephora Pierre) shaded with Gliricidia sepium (Jacq.) and a forest
   fragment (8 ha) in the intermediate stage of secondary succession. For
   the sampling, soil pitfall traps and the Winkler extractor were used. A
   total of 53 species were collected in the present study. The highest
   species richness was observed in the agroforestry (38 species), followed
   by shaded coffee (31 species), secondary forest (29 species) and banana
   plantation (28 species). In the dry season there was effect of land use
   type and leaf litter depth on the richness and diversity of ant species.
   In both seasons, ant species composition varied significantly among all
   the studied areas. The agroforestry systems are important alternatives
   to monocultures due to their diversity of cultivated species and plant
   strata. Thus, the increase of the structural heterogeneity of the
   environment and the leaf litter depth, in cultivated areas in the dry
   season, may lead to greater species richness and diversity as well as
   changes in the species composition.},

Abstract = {Tibouchina pulchra (Cham.) Cogn. (Melastomataceae) is a native tree
   species from the southeast region of Brazil. This early successional
   species significantly contributes to the characteristic physiognomy and
   structure of the Atlantic Rain Forest. Saplings were exposed to carbon
   filtered air (CF), ambient non-filtered air (NF), and ambient
   non-filtered air +40 ppb ozone (NF+O-3), 8 h per day during two months,
   using open top chambers (OTC). The AOT40 values at the end of the
   experiment were 48, 910 and 12 895 ppb h(-1), respectively for each
   treatment. After 25 days of exposure, interveinal red stippling appeared
   in plants in the NF+O-3 chamber (AOT40=3 871 ppb h(-1)). In the NF
   chamber, symptoms were observed only after 60 days of exposure
   (AOT40=910 ppb h(-1)). No changes were observed for total phenolic
   contents when comparing ozone treatments. However, amounts of tannins
   and flavonoids were different among treatments. NF+O-3 and NF treatment
   showed enhanced contents of flavonoids, when tannins seem to be reduced
   after ozone fumigation (p<0.01). Results suggest alteration on phenolic
   metabolism when saplings are ozone fumigated; those responses,
   considered T. pulchra, seem to occur before leaf injury appeared, once
   contents of flavonoids and tannins are also altered by NF treatment
   (AOT40=910 ppb h(-1)). This study demonstrates that total phenolic and
   tannins contents of saplings of T. pulchra also decreased when exposed
   to ozone. The same alterations were observed for T. pulchra after
   industrial air pollution, suggesting the reduction on total phenolic and
   tannins probably is a characteristic response of T. pulchra to presence
   of any kind of pollutant.},

Journal = {LIMNOLOGICA},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {44},
Pages = {40-48},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {We investigated the dynamics of organic matter and type of detritus in a
   riparian zone of the Atlantic Rain Forest domain, and specifically
   determined the inputs and stock of detritus contributed by plant
   species, and their relationship to temperature and precipitation. Our
   hypotheses tested were: (1) the species composition of riparian
   vegetation influences the amount and type of detritus delivered to a
   stream in an Atlantic Rain Forest, and (2) the dynamics of litterfall in
   the riparian zone is influenced by climate factors. The plant community
   was formed principally by pioneer and early successional species such as
   Apuleia leiocarpa, Erytrina velutina, Erytrina verna, Eucalyptus
   torelliana, Ficus glabra, Ficus insipida, Guarea guidonea, Guarea
   guidonia, Maprounea guianensis and Psidium guajava. There was a large
   number of G. guidonea (318 individuals/ha), followed by Cupania
   oblongifolia (91), Trichilia pallida (52), Piptadenia gonoacantha (26)
   and E. torelliana (14). G. guidonea contributed >50\% of the total
   litterfall; however, some species which were present in high density in
   the plant community and did not yield significant biomass, indicating
   that detritus production was based on the contribution of a few species.
   We found 697, 856 and 804 g/m(2)/year from vertical, terrestrial, and
   lateral inputs, respectively, whereas to the annual benthic standing
   stock was 3257 g/m(2). Detritus was formed by leaves (60\%), branches
   (32\%), reproductive parts (3\%), and unidentifiable fragments of
   organic-matter (5\%). Inputs and benthic stock were markedly seasonal,
   with an increase of leaf litter during the dry season. Our results
   indicate that litterfall dynamics is basically composed of a few species
   that contribute with higher values of biomass. Moreover, ecological
   characteristics together with environmental factors can be viewed as the
   principal factors determining the energy balance of riparian ecosystems.
   The biological implications of the dynamics of organic matter have high
   importance for the maintenance and restoration of riparian zones.
   However, the amount of litterfall required to maintain the balance of
   the riparian community remains unclear in the tropical zone. (C) 2013

Abstract = {The effects of neighboring vegetation and soil fertility on the
   establishment, survival and growth of tree species were studied in a
   subtropical old-field area in south Brazil. Seed damage, germination and
   seedling establishment of four tree species plus growth and survival of
   two transplanted tree species were monitored under factorial
   combinations of the following treatments: (1) pioneer vegetation
   (presence and absence); (2) soil fertility (addition of NPK and
   control). Facilitation was the main process affecting plant performance.
   The presence of pioneer vegetation significantly improved germination,
   establishment, growth and survival of most study species. Around 90\% of
   sown seeds were damaged and the removal of pioneer vegetation
   significantly increased seed damage for all species studied, decreased
   germination in three out of four species, and decreased establishment in
   one species. Moreover a significantly higher seedling growth rate of
   Inga virescens was found after the first year of the experiment in plots
   where vegetation was present. The presence of vegetation significantly
   increased seedling survival of I. virescens by protecting seedlings from
   leaf loss due to winter frosts. Competition was detected by the second
   year when a higher growth of transplanted seedlings of the species
   Araucaria angustifolia occurred in plots where vegetation was present
   and fertilizer were applied. A lower growth rate was detected in plots
   where vegetation was present but fertilizer was not applied. These
   results indicate a balance between competition for soil nutrients and
   protection by neighbor vegetation. Damage of seedlings by leaf cutter
   ants was an important barrier for plant survival. Damage occurred in
   80\% of the A. angustifolia seedlings and 58\% of these damaged
   seedlings died. The presence of neighboring vegetation tended to protect
   seedlings from ant damage. Although competition occurred, facilitation
   seems to be the main process driving early successional changes in this
   subtropical old field. This was mainly due to the improvement of local
   microclimatic conditions and protection against herbivores by
   neighboring vegetation. Facilitation occurred during establishment and
   growth phases in a subtropical area that is considered a productive, low
   stress environment. Our results indicate that facilitation may be more
   frequent in productive environments than previously thought.},

Title = {Texture prediction of natural soils in the Brazilian Amazon through
   proximal sensors},
Journal = {GEODERMA REGIONAL},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {37},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Proximal sensors provide fast, low-cost, environmentally friendly, and
   reliable analyses for the characterization of soils and other materials.
   Numerous studies have been conducted on soils in temperate regions, but
   there are knowledge gaps regarding the use of these devices in tropical
   soils, especially in the Amazon region. In this regard, this study
   utilized portable proximal sensors of X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy
   (pXRF) and diffuse reflectance spectroscopy in the visible to
   near-infrared region (Vis-NIR) for predicting the texture of natural
   soils in 61 municipalities in the state of Par<acute accent>a, Amazon
   region, Brazil. The objectives were: i) to investigate the accuracy of
   soil texture prediction based on data from sensors separately and sensor
   fusion (pXRF and Vis-NIR data) using two supervised algorithms (Random
   Forest, RF, and Support Vector Machine, SVM) and ii) to assess the
   effect of soil horizon (superficial and subsuperficial horizons, and
   their combination) in predicting the texture of tropical natural soils.
   In total, 233 soil samples were collected in the 0-20 cm and 80-100 cm
   depths, equivalent to superficial and subsuperficial horizons in areas
   with primary or secondary forest cover with at least 20 years of natural
   regeneration and approximately 20 ha of coverage area. The hydrometer
   method was used for soil texture analysis. In parallel, a portion of the
   soil samples was analyzed by pXRF and Vis-NIR, in triplicate, under
   laboratory conditions. The predictive models with RF were more robust
   compared to the models obtained with SVM, according to ratio performance
   interquartile distance (RPIQ), coefficient of determination (R2), root
   mean square error (RMSE), and mean absolute error (MAE). The R2 values
   obtained by pXRF, Vis-NIR, and sensor data combination were,
   respectively, 0.89, 0.87, and 0.93 for sand; 0.92, 0.90, and 0.93 for
   clay; and 0.91, 0.67, and 0.93 for silt. Overall, clay prediction models
   achieved higher R2 values compared to sand and silt models. Soil texture
   prediction using sensor fusion showed lower RMSE values and higher R2
   and RPIQ values, respectively (sand: 7.79, 0.93, 4.69; clay: 5.58, 0.93,
   3.86; and silt: 5.72, 0.92, 2.92) compared to the best-performing sensor
   individually (Vis-NIR). With regard to the optimal model utilizing
   individual sensor data, Vis-NIR models exhibited reduced error for clay
   and sand prediction. The effect of combining horizons to a single and
   bigger dataset was minimally important for the models. The results
   demonstrate confidence in the use of proximal sensors for soil texture
   assessment in natural Amazon soils, aiming to reduce costs and the time
   required for analyses.},

   native Caatinga (NCa) in Brazil. Enzyme activity, abundance and
   composition of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), and production of
   glomalin-related soil proteins (GRSP) were evaluated at soil depths of
   0-0.05 m. AMF species composition in the AFS was more similar to that in
   the NCa than in the SBF and CaR6 systems. In the rainy season,
   sporulation was most abundant in the AFS-1, CaR6, and SBF systems,
   whereas GRSP concentrations were highest in the AFS5 during the dry
   season. Acid phosphatase and arylsulfatase enzyme activity was lower in
   the AFS1 soils than in the NCa and SBF soils (rainy period), and levels
   of beta-glucosidase and fluorescein diacetate hydrolysis in the AFS were
   equal to or higher than those in the NCa in the dry season but lower in
   the rainy season. AFS thus appear to promote the maintenance of soil
   biological quality, and may be more sustainable than SBF farming systems
   in the Brazilian Caatinga over the long term.},

Title = {Does land use affect perceptual range? Evidence from two marsupials of
   the Atlantic Forest},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {284},
Number = {1},
Pages = {53-59},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Perceptual range is one of the main determinants of dispersal success in
   fragmented landscapes, which are composed of scattered remnants of
   original habitat in a matrix of variable composition. How perceptual
   range varies according to land use is essential information to estimate
   the functional connectivity of landscapes. We determined for the first
   time how different types of land use affect the perceptual range of a
   species, using as model organisms two neotropical marsupials endemic to
   the Atlantic Forest in Brazil (Philander frenatus and Didelphis aurita).
   We released and tracked the movements of 196 individuals in three types
   of land use commonly found in fragmented landscapes: manioc plantation,
   mowed pasture and abandoned pasture. We also determined how orientation
   to the nearest forest fragment is affected by distance to the fragment,
   wind speed, body mass and sex using a model selection approach. The type
   of land use affected the perceptual ranges of both marsupials. The
   estimated perceptual ranges for P. frenatus and D. aurita were 100 and
   200 m in the mowed pasture, respectively, 50 and < 30 m in the abandoned
   pasture and 30 and 50 m in the plantation. The orientation of both
   species decreased with increasing distance to the fragment, but for D.
   aurita orientation also increased with the wind speed and body mass.
   These results agree with previous studies depicting a general pattern of
   increased perceptual range with lower vegetation obstruction in the
   matrix and larger body mass and wind speed, depending on the use of
   visual versus olfactory cues by animals. Our findings allow more
   realistic estimates of functional connectivity in fragmented landscapes
   based on basic information on the biology of each species and the type
   of matrix.},

Title = {Fluvial avulsions influence soil fertility in the Pantanal wetlands
   (Brazil)},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {926},
Month = {MAY 20},
Abstract = {River avulsions drive important changes in the Pantanal wetlands, owing
   to their role in the hydrosedimentology of the region. Although relevant
   to numerous ecosystem services, few studies have analyzed the influence
   of river avulsions on soil fertility in the Pantanal. Here, we use the
   largest ongoing avulsion in the Taquari River (Caronal region) to
   evaluate the effects on soil fertility, considering two factors:
   avulsion stage (1) and aquatic-terrestrial succession (2). Since both
   factors are influenced by macrophyte abundance, an incident map was
   created through tasseled cap indices from Sentinel 2 images to guide
   sampling efforts in flooded soils. The mapped area was split into two
   zones of alluvial processes, the first from the apex of the Caronal lobe
   corresponding to the Taquari River megafan (TRM), and the second as the
   distal Paraguay River floodplain (PRF). Soil macro- and micronutrient
   levels were evaluated from 42 surface samples (0-0.2 m) distributed
   across the two alluvial process zones. The macrophyte map's overall
   accuracy (OA) was analyzed by a confusion matrix using the Sentinel 2
   imagery. Finally, we used Random Forest regressions to determine the
   influence of response variables on soil attributes, including tassel
   indices, distance from the Caronal crevasse, macrophyte density, and an
   existing soil fertility map. The macrophyte map obtained an OA of 93 \%.
   Some parameters such as pH (r = -0.62; R2 = 0.57), effective cation
   exchange capacity (r = -0.49; R2 = 0.79), Mn (r = -0.71; R2 = 0.6), Zn
   (r = -0.69; R2 = 0.54), and base saturation (r = -0.7; R2 = 0.93) were
   influenced by the distance or level of maturation of the avulsion stage
   in the TRM. Our scattering of soil collections was insufficient to test
   the terrestrialization hypothesis (2). The study results show that river
   channel avulsions influence the accumulation of mineral and organic
   nutrients in tropical floodplain soils, which has implications for
   fertility and biodiversity.},

Title = {Late Quaternary sedimentary dynamics in Western Amazonia: Implications

Journal = {GEOMORPHOLOGY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {177},
Pages = {74-92},
Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {This work investigated the evolution of sedimentary environments during
   the latest Quaternary and their influence on the paradoxical occurrence
   of open vegetation patches in sharp contact with the Amazonian forest.
   The approach integrated pre-existing geological and floristic data from
   lowlands in the Brazilian Amazonia, with remote sensing imagery
   including multispectral optical images (TM, ETM+, and ASTER), Phased
   Array L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR), InSAR C-band SRTM-DEMs,
   and high resolution images obtained from Google Earth (TM). The
   detection of an abundance of paleomorphologies provided evidence of a
   scenario in which constant environmental shifts were linked to the
   evolution of fluvial and megafan depositional systems. In all studied
   areas, the open vegetation patches are not random, but associated with
   sedimentary deposits representative of environments either deactivated
   during the Holocene or presently in the process of deactivation.
   Sedimentary evolution would have determined the distribution of wetlands
   and terra firme in many areas of the Amazonian lowlands, and would have
   a major impact on the development of open vegetated patches within the
   modern rainforest. Subsiding areas were filled up with megafan deposits,
   and many fluvial tributaries were rearranged on the landscape. The close
   relationship between vegetation and the physical environment suggests
   that sedimentary history related to the evolution of depositional
   settings during the latest Quaternary played a major role in the
   distribution of flooded and non-flooded areas of the Amazonian lowlands,
   with a direct impact on the distribution of modem floristic patterns. As
   the depositional sites were abandoned and their sedimentary deposits
   were exposed to the surface, they became sites suitable for vegetation
   growth, first of herbaceous species and then of forest. Although climate
   fluctuations might have been involved, fault reactivation appears to
   have been the main cause of changes in depositional dynamics through
   time, a process that had an immediate effect on the development of large
   open vegetation patches intermingled with the Amazonian rainforest. (c)

Abstract = {Regenerating forests make up an increasingly large portion of tropical
   landscapes worldwide and regeneration dynamics may be influenced by
   leaf-cutting ants (LCA), which proliferate in disturbed areas and
   collect seeds for fungus culturing. Here, we investigate how LCA
   influences seed fate in human-modified areas of Caatinga dry forest. We
   evaluate the seed deposition and predation on Atta opaciceps nests,
   foraging habitat surrounding nest and control habitat away of nest
   influence of 15 colonies located along a forest cover gradient during
   the rainy and dry seasons. For each habitat, four 50-cm(2) plots were
   established and all seeds on the soil surface were collected along 1
   year. We recorded 13,628 seeds distributed among 47 species and 36.57\%
   of the total seeds did not show any sign of predation. Nest mound
   habitats supported low-density and species-poor seed assemblages, which
   were taxonomically distinct from the control habitats. These effects
   only occurred in the rainy season. The proportion of undamaged seeds
   were similar across the habitats. While forest cover did not influence
   seed assemblage in terms of species richness or seed predation, it did
   interact with habitat type via increments in seed abundance as forest
   cover increased across the nests. Forest cover also affected seed
   composition, but only in the rainy season. These results indicate that
   LCA decrease seed deposition in areas under their influence,
   particularly on the nest mounds. As LCA profit from human disturbance in
   the Caatinga, their role as seed `sinks' should be enhanced in disturbed
   Caatinga patches, particularly during the rainy season, when most of the
   plant recruitment occurs. Our findings reinforce the importance of LCA
   as drivers of forest dynamics and resilience in human-modified
   landscapes.},

Abstract = {Population structure and dynamics of the black-cheeked gnateater
   (Conopophaga melanops) were studied at Salto Morato Nature Reserve, in
   Parana, southern Brazil, from October 2006 to September 2007. Territory
   size and population density, breeding season (timing and length).
   reproductive success and annual survival rates were estimated from
   sightings of 18 marked adult birds and the success of 18 nesting
   attempts. The black-cheeked gnateater is socially monogamous and
   territorial, with a breeding-season length of approximately 3 mo
   beginning in early October. Predation caused most nest failures, nest
   survival was 0.96 d(-1) and apparent annual nesting success was 22\%,
   resulting in annual productivity of 0.36 individuals per adult. Apparent
   adult annual survival was similar to 0.44 y(-1). Seventy-five per cent
   of fledglings survived at least 2 mo after fledging. Two methods of
   estimating population growth rate suggest very different rates: r =
   -0.0.4 (similar to stable), or lambda varies between 0.475-0.616
   (declining). Yet, low apparent adult survival suggests that territories
   are not permanent, perhaps abandoned after nest failure. We find that by
   estimating population growth, even in short-term studies, testable
   hypotheses can be generated that will allow better understanding of
   population dynamics.},

Abstract = {The aim of this study was to investigate how the temporal patterns of
   the most abundant species in the communities determine the succession
   processes in different vegetation formations of the Cerrado Biome. In
   the first inventory, in 2010 in the Cerrado stricto sensu and Cerradao,
   the diameter of all individuals 30 cm above the ground (DAS, 0.30m) >=
   5.0cm was identified and measured. For the SSF in 2011, all living
   individuals with breast height diameter (DBH) >= 5,0 cm were measured
   and identified. The second inventory in the three phyto-physiognomies
   was carried out in 2015, when the same criteria of the previous
   inventory were adopted. Mortality was higher than recruitment, in all
   populations studied, 15 populations had no individuals recruited and
   only two species (Bowdichia virgilioides Kunth and Caryocar brasiliense
   Cambess) did not lose individuals. Changes in dynamic parameters varied
   among populations and recruitment was higher in populations with the
   highest loss of individuals, indicating that these species, regardless
   of their phyto-physiognomy, have a greater regeneration potential after
   disturbances.},

Abstract = {The rapid pace of deforestation and fragmentation that took place in the
   Brazilian Atlantic Forest and other global hotspots for biodiversity
   conservation has motivated ecosystem restoration efforts. The genetic
   viability of restored tree populations and their potential to conserve
   genetic diversity remains, however, unclear. Here, we assessed the
   genetic viability and potential to conserve the genetic diversity of
   restored populations of Centrolobium tomentosum, a native legume tree,
   in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, based on a genotyping by sequencing
   (GBS). We have successfully generated a total of 2877 single nucleotide
   polymorphism (SNP) markers across the whole C. tomentosum genome.
   Surprisingly, restoration sites presented overall higher levels of
   genetic diversity compared to natural remnant areas and negative
   inbreeding coefficient (F-IS), mainly in juveniles' trees from newer
   restored areas, indicating an excess of heterozygotes probably due to
   the founding event. The most likely number of genetic clusters found was
   two (K = 2), suggesting that diverse seed sources were used to produce
   seedlings for restoration. Clear signs of gene flow from restored to
   natural remnants areas had also been detected when diversity values of
   adults and juveniles were contrasted. Even though we did not find any
   clear relation of the genetic diversity and landscape composition, the
   low percentage of forest and high levels of fragmentation are likely
   reducing patch connectivity in some areas. LOSITAN detected 88 SNP
   outliers under positive selection, but analysis with Bayescan failed to
   support this evidence. In conclusion, our post hoc evaluation of
   restored tree populations indicated that the old restored area is stable
   and new areas have great potential to contribute to conserving genetic
   diversity and increasing the chances of the natural populations to
   persist over time.},

Abstract = {Shade-tolerant forest species are among the most susceptible to habitat
   loss in agricultural mosaics, where a variety of croplands is connected
   to forests at different levels of anthropogenic disturbance. We aimed to
   evaluate the community similarity of shade-tolerant species among
   different land use types across agricultural mosaics with different
   levels of disturbance. The study was conducted in three municipalities
   in southern and southeastern Para state, in eastern Amazonia. A
   multiple-community similarity measure based on the Horn similarity index
   was used to compare land use types and assess the resilience of
   shade-tolerant species towards forest loss and disturbance at the
   landscape level. High shade-tolerant species similarity was found
   between mature forest fragments that underwent different levels of
   disturbance in all three agricultural mosaics, but secondary forests had
   lower similarity with mature forest in the most fragmented and altered
   mosaic. Shade-tolerant species showed very low density in croplands, but
   the same group of species seemed to colonize agricultural fields of
   annual crops and clean pasture, as they showed high community
   similarity. Another group of species was present in invaded pastures,
   probably due to the effects of time since land abandonment after woody
   species colonization. Mixed tree plantations were more similar to mature
   and secondary forests than other types of croplands. Shade-tolerant
   species similarity was higher among land use types inserted in
   agricultural landscapes that maintained conserved forest fragments. Our
   results suggest that the conservation of mature forests and landscape
   connectivity are crucial to the maintenance of shade-tolerant species in
   agricultural mosaics.},

   of reproducers presence, canopy openness, declivity, basal area and soil
   coverage on recruitment of individuals in this population? We
   distinguished four ontogenetic stages in A. phalerata. Reproducers and
   virgins were sampled by using 25 plots (400 m(2)), juveniles and
   seedlings were sampled in sub-plots (100 m(2)). We found 2,328 Attalea
   phalerata individuals per hectare, first two ontogenetic stages
   accounted for 89.8\% of the total, describing a relatively stable
   population. None of the analyzed factors were affecting the natural
   regeneration of Attalea phalerata in the fragment. The density and

   formation of oligarchic forests, moreover, the species seems to be able

Title = {Abandoned pastures cannot spontaneously recover the attributes of
   old-growth savannas},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {55},
Number = {3},
Pages = {1164-1172},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {1. Active restoration strategies have been recommended to recover
   Neotropical savannas in abandoned lands, but no studies have
   investigated the trajectories and speeds of spontaneous recovery for
   these systems. Research into the dynamics of degraded savannas is
   urgently needed to guide restoration decision making.
   2. We analysed the dynamics of secondary savannas in the Brazilian
   Cerrado by sampling 29 abandoned pastures (time since abandonment
   ranging from 3 to 25 years) and applying the space-for-time substitution
   method. We modelled the temporal changes in plant community attributes
   and estimated the time (years) required for these attributes to match
   those of two reference ecosystems (three replicates each), old-growth
   savanna and a forest-type savanna, which had encroached following fire
   suppression (encroached savanna). We also analysed the plant community
   composition of the study sites.
   3. Our models showed that tree canopy cover, richness and density
   rapidly increased with time since pasture abandonment, easily surpassing
   the values of the old-growth savanna (28 years) and reaching the values
   of encroached savanna 49 years after abandonment. The cover and richness
   of the ground layer increased at a much slower pace. Since the species
   in this layer, including the exotic grasses, are shade intolerant, they
   will be eliminated by canopy closure over time.
   4. Up to 25 years after abandonment, secondary savannas continued to
   lack many (37\%) old-growth savanna species, mostly from the ground
   layer (82\% of grasses absent). This period was also not sufficient for
   the secondary savannas to become floristically similar to the encroached
   savannas, which are dominated by shade-tolerant tree species.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Despite the reported high natural
   regeneration of Neotropical savanna vegetation, abandoned pastures will
   not spontaneously return to an old-growth savanna state. Protected from
   fire and lacking the native ground layer, the end state of secondary
   savannas will be a low-diversity forest. If restoration goals include
   the recovery of old-growth savanna biodiversity and structure,
   interventions are required to prevent woody encroachment and reintroduce
   native grasses, forbs and shrubs. However, if the desirable endpoint is
   a low-diversity forest, passive restoration (non-intervention) and fire
   protection are appropriate.},

Abstract = {Understanding the effect of different C. citriodora removal management
   in a Conservation Unit (CU) aimed at forest restoration on the dynamics
   of the labile and stable fractions of the SOM and to quantify the
   stoichiometric relationships of these fractions. Soil samples were
   collected in four areas in the Uniao Biological Reserve (REBIO), Rio de
   Janeiro, Brazil, namely: forest (FF); C. citriodora trees submitted to
   girdling (GR); C. citriodora trees submitted to the practice of clear
   cutting and subsequent planting of native species (PL); abandoned C.
   citriodora trees without management practice (EU). In these samples, the
   total content of carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) in the
   air-dried fine earth (ADFE) were determined; in light-fraction organic
   matter (LFOM) and in the particle size fractions of SOM. It was observed
   that the C:N and C:P ratios were higher in the EU area and lower in PL
   in both ADFE and LFOM samples. In EU, lower levels of C, N and P were
   observed in the SOM particulate fraction. GR favors the production of
   less recalcitrant and more labile material when compared to EU. The
   short time (4 years) of implementation of the system in PL directly
   affects the low production of LFOM; however, this material has high
   levels of N and P, favoring the low C:N and C:P ratio. EU intensifies
   the concentration of nutrients in stable fractions in the soil, which
   can favor the preservation of the soil structure, mitigating its losses.},

Abstract = {Most tropical forests are threatened by a myriad of human-induced
   disturbances, associated with land use changes, altered fire regimes and
   direct deforestation. The combined effect of multiple disturbances can
   shift forests towards a new, resilient state that is qualitatively
   distinct in structure, species composition and function. We found that
   abandoned pastures affected by fires in the Brazilian Atlantic forest
   showed similarity in terms of vegetation structure and plant functional
   traits to a savanna-like ecosystem. Burned communities exhibited more
   C-4 grass cover, higher proportion of resprouts and lower canopy cover
   as compared to the old-growth forest. Moreover, 79\% of woody species at
   the burned sites are generalists with a widespread distribution, which
   includes the cerrado (Brazilian savanna). Woody species composition was
   strikingly different from old-growth forests, since burned sites were
   dominated by Moquiniastrum polymorphum (Less.) G. Sancho (Asteraceae), a
   fire-resistant species with a ruderal behavior that was absent in the
   old-growth forests. The results observed in this study provide
   biological evidence for an arrested succession with the establishment of
   a savanna-like ecosystem as an alternative stable state. These findings
   reinforce the notion that the establishment of an alternative stable
   state (e.g., savanna-like state) hypothesis for the Brazilian Atlantic
   Forest should be considered, especially under the current climate change
   scenarios. (C) 2019 Associacao Brasileira de Ciencia Ecologica e

Journal = {LAND USE POLICY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {137},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The Brazilian scientific community and non-governmental groups have been
   working to establish forest restoration programs, compensating for
   deforestation and mitigating losses from biodiversity and ecosystem
   services. In contrast, the previous Brazilian government moved in an
   opposite direction, revoking legal acts and providing scope for the
   rural producers to sustain non-compliance activities according to the
   legal regulations. Among rural producers, there is a recognized conflict
   between agricultural production and forest restoration programs, which
   results in a chaotic condition where the implementation of the
   environmental laws is impaired. In this context, restoration projects
   are often practiced without effective integrated territorial planning.
   This scenario challenges the success of large-scale restoration
   programs. The Brazilian government needs to effectively adopt sound
   guidelines already suggested to promote a genuine state of governance,
   fostering restoration programs, and moving the country's development
   towards an ecologically planned environment.},

Abstract = {Nutrient losses during slash-and-burn clearing in tropical forests,
   coupled with demand by food crops, can deplete nutrients and result in
   crop abandonment after 1-2 years. Slash-and-mulch technology prevents
   nutrient losses from burning, while mulch decomposition may serve as a
   nutrient source. This research investigates the release of nutrients
   from the mulch and potential uptake of released N by plant biomass after
   a multi-species agroforestry system was planted in June 2005, following
   the clearing of a 1 ha of 7-year-old forest with a mulching tractor in
   Igarap, A double dagger u, Brazil. The study evaluated soil conditions,
   mulch decomposition, and nutrient concentrations of Manihot esculenta
   and native vegetation under treatments of P+K fertilization in
   combination with four native tree species and N-fixing Inga edulis, or
   with three native tree species without I. edulis. Mulch layer N, Ca and
   Mg content decreased in response to fertilization, while mulch layer P
   and K content increased. Nutrient content increased in M. esculenta
   stems and tubers with fertilization and in the presence of I. edulis,
   and in competing vegetation with fertilization. Estimated tree N content
   increased 311 \% with fertilization, but by 154 \% in the presence of I.
   edulis. Fertilization with P+K, as well as the presence of I. edulis,
   increased N stocks in total biomass.},

Volume = {13},

Month = {MAR 16},
Abstract = {There is increasing interest in the restoration/regeneration of degraded
   tropical habitats yet the potential role of natural regenerators remains
   unclear. We test the hypothesis that the richness and functional
   diversity of terrestrial mammals differs between forest regrowth stages.
   We quantified the richness and functional diversity of eight terrestrial
   mammal seed-disperser species across a forest regrowth gradient in the
   eastern Brazilian Amazon. We installed camera-traps in 15 sites within
   small-holder properties with forest regrowth stage classified into three
   groups, with five sites each of: late second-regrowth forest, early
   second-regrowth forest and abandoned pasture. Species richness and
   functional dispersion from the regrowth sites were compared with 15
   paired forest control sites. Multi model selection showed that regrowth
   class was more important for explaining patterns in richness and
   functional diversity than other variables from three non-mutually
   exclusive hypotheses: hunting (distance to house, distance to river,
   distance to town, small holder residence), land cover (\% forest cover
   within 50 meters, 1 kilometer and 5 kilometers) and land use (regrowth
   class, time since last use). Differences in functional diversity were
   most strongly explained by a loss of body mass. We found that diversity
   in regrowth sites could be similar to control sites even in some
   early-second regrowth areas. This finding suggests that when surrounded
   by large intact forest areas the richness and functional diversity close
   to human small-holdings can return to pre-degradation values. Yet we
   also found a significant reduction in richness and functional diversity
   in more intensely degraded pasture sites. This reduction in richness and
   functional diversity may limit the potential for regeneration and
   increase costs for ecological regeneration and restoration actions
   around more intense regrowth areas.},

Volume = {9},

Abstract = {Artificial perches have been considered an effective way to increase the
   influx of zoochoric seeds on degraded areas. A main barrier to seedling
   recruitment beneath perches is competition with other plants, including
   non-native or invasive species. We therefore believed that the seedling
   recruitment would increase with invasive species management through
   solarization. We assessed the use of artificial perches combined with
   solarization as a management technique for forest restoration. An
   outline of subdivided plots was installed in an abandoned pasture
   originally covered by subtropical Atlantic forest in southern Brazil.
   The invasive species were Nutgrass (Cyperus rotundus - Cyperaceae) and
   African Liverseed Grass (Urochloa arrecta - Poaceae). Solarization was
   achieved using a black polyethylene cover. Artificial perches were
   installed after solarization was complete. Seed rain and established
   plant community species were assessed. Solarization initially eliminated
   previously existing vegetation, but the effects were not long lasting.
   Invasive species grew aggressively by vegetative means from the borders
   of solarized areas. Artificial perches increased the influx of zoochoric
   seeds, but the seeds were unable to germinate and establish due to
   competition by the fast growing invasive species. The combined use of
   artificial perches and solarization for forest restoration seems to have
   limited effectiveness.},

Abstract = {The use of artificial perches is an efficient technique to forest
   restoration. We aimed to (1) evaluate the effect of the presence of
   artificial perches on the number of forest seeds deposited on seed fall
   collectors, (2) identify the seed dispersal syndromes, and (3) to
   analyze the effect of distance from the forest border on seed input.
   Field work was performed in the municipality of Iguaba Grande, Rio de
   Janeiro, Brazil. We installed 70 seed fall collectors (with diameter of
   0.50 m) distributed in transects parallelly distant 5, 15 e 35 m from
   the forest border in abandoned pasture, and in one transect 10 m from
   the border, in the forest interior. Each transect outside the forest
   patch received ten seed fall collectors, installed under artificial
   perches, and ten seed fall collectors, installed without perches. In the
   forest interior, we installed ten collectors. During three weeks of
   sampling, we obtained 418 seeds, classified into 242 zoochoric seeds
   (57.9\%) and 176 anemochoric seeds (42.1\%). The average seed with the
   presence of artificial perch was 7.4 (+/- 3.9) seeds/m(2)/month while in
   the absence of artificial perch the average was 1.7 (+/- 1.8)
   seeds/m(2)/month, considering anemochoric and zoochoric seeds. Different
   distances from the forest edge, up to 35 m, did not influence the number
   of zoochoric and anemochoric seeds. The presence of artificial perches
   increased at 118 times the number of seeds dispersed by animals when
   compared to traps without perches. Artificial perches work as catalyzing
   structures for forest restoration, with a significant increase in the
   input of zoochoric seeds.},

Abstract = {Sustainable Use of Calathea lutea in Handicrafts: A Case Study from the
   Aman Sustainable Development Reserve in the Brazilian Amazon. This study
   evaluated the local harvest and use of Calathea lutea, an herb used in
   basket weaving by residents of floodplain communities in the Aman
   Sustainable Development Reserve (RDSA). C. lutea is associated with
   early successional stages of secondary vegetation or abandoned fields,
   often found alone in monospecific stands, called caua double dagger
   uzais. We describe the biology and ecology of C. lutea, including
   distribution, abundance, and resource availability using GIS and field
   inventory methods. We measured the area of each surveyed and
   georeferenced C. lutea stand and estimated the production and
   consumption of mature stalks in this area. With this information, we
   estimated the current status of the extractive use of this plant. C.
   lutea grows vigorously and flowers continuously with an average of 1,699
   (+/- 754) clumps ha(-1) in the stands. The total 41 georeferenced stands
   cover an area of 26 ha, with an estimated 44,200 clumps and 850,000
   mature stalks. In 2006, approximately 15,000 mature stalks were used by
   artisans, about 2 \% of the available stock. Therefore, the present
   stock meets artisansA ` demand with no evidence that the species is
   suffering from overharvesting. We also observed that the species
   inhibits plant succession due to its high capacity for dispersal,
   colonization, and permanence in secondary areas. It has, as a result,
   colonized about 50 \% of high floodplain (varzea) areas formerly
   converted to agricultural fields in two of the four communities surveyed
   in this study. To establish more productive and healthy agroecosystems,
   we suggest enrichment of fallows with fruit and wood producing trees
   where C. lutea is less exploited.},

Abstract = {The rupture of Fund \& atilde;o Dam spilled contaminated tailings across
   the Doce river basin, severely damaging municipalities such as the urban
   Barra Longa and the rural Gesteira. The wave of tailings led to the
   sediment deposition in rivers margins, causing the loss of riparian
   forests and cropping areas. Sediment analyses confirmed the presence of
   toxic compounds (sodium and ether amine) and a very low fertility. In
   consequence, there was a sharp decline in agro-pastoral production in
   Gesteira, leading to land abandonment and rural exodus. In the urban
   area of Barra Longa, the wave of tailings damaged the urban floodplain
   and the square, which were rehabilitated using grey infrastructure.
   Alternatively, we proposed a new landscape recovery plan for both Barra
   Longa and Gesteira based on Nature and Community-based solutions that
   contemplate the inclusion of green infrastructure, the remediation of
   toxic compounds, the restoration of soil fertility, permeability and
   stabilization, riparian forest rehabilitation and the recovery of

Abstract = {In this paper we analyze and compare natural regeneration in shrub-tree
   community in three areas below Pinus caribaea stands and a natural area
   (cerrado sensu stricto). We also analyze the influence of biophysical
   and environmental variables on the distribution of regenerating
   shrub-tree species. The areas were analyzed and compared in relation to
   dispersal syndromes as well, being zoochory and anemochory the
   prevailing syndroms in the four areas. The sites below P. caribaea show
   a heterogeneous regeneration with the number of species ranging from 18
   to 42. We analyzed the influence of the biophysical and environmental
   variables performing a canonical correspondence analyses, being found
   significant values for variables distance from remnant and basal area.
   The species Siparuna guianensis, Miconia albicans, Xylopia aromatica,
   Sclerolobium paniculatum, Casearia sylvestris and P. caribaea were the
   most importante ones in the four areas.},

Abstract = {Forest restoration mitigates climate change by removing CO2 and storing
   C in terrestrial ecosystems. However, incomplete information on C
   storage in restored tropical forests often fails to capture the
   ecosystem's holistic C dynamics. This study provides an integrated
   assessment of C storage in above to belowground subsystems, its
   consequences for greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes, and the quantity, quality,
   and origin of soil organic matter (SOM) in restored Atlantic forests in
   Brazil. Relations between SOM properties and soil health indicators were
   also explored. We examined two restorations using tree planting ('active
   restoration'): an 8-year-old forest with green manure and native trees
   planted in two rounds, and a 15-year-old forest with native-planted
   trees in one round without green manure. Restorations were compared to
   reformed pasture and primary forest sites. We measured C storage in soil
   layers (0-10, 10-20, and 20-30 cm), litter, and plants. GHG emissions
   were assessed using CH4 and CO2 fluxes. SOM quantity was evaluated using
   C and N, quality using humification index (HLIFS), and origin using \&
   delta;13C and \& delta;15N. Nine soil health indicators were
   interrelated with SOM attributes. The primary forest presented the
   highest C stocks (107.7 Mg C ha-1), followed by 15- and 8-year-old
   restorations and pasture with 69.8, 55.5, and 41.8 Mg C ha-1,
   respectively. Soil C stocks from restorations and pasture were 20\%
   lower than primary forest. However, 8- and 15-year-old restorations
   stored 12.3 and 28.3 Mg ha-1 more aboveground C than pasture. The
   younger forest had \& delta;13C and \& delta;15N values of 2.1 and 1.7
   \& PTSTHOUSND;, respectively, lower than the 15-year-old forest,
   indicating more C derived from C3 plants and biological N fixation. Both
   restorations and pasture had at least 34\% higher HLIFS in deeper soil
   layers (10-30 cm) than primary forest, indicating a lack of labile SOM.
   Native and 15-year-old forests exhibited higher soil methane influx
   (141.1 and 61.9 \& mu;g m-2 h-1). Forests outperformed pasture in most
   soil health indicators, with 69\% of their variance explained by SOM
   properties. However, SOM quantity and quality regeneration in both
   restorations approached the pristine forest state only in the top 10 cm
   layer, while deeper soil retained agricultural degradation legacies. In
   conclusion, active restoration of the Atlantic Forest is a superior
   approach compared to pasture reform for GHG mitigation. Nonetheless, the
   development of restoration techniques to facilitate labile C input into
   deeper soil layers (>10 cm) is needed to further improve soil
   multifunctionality and long-term C storage.},

Title = {Recruitment, growth and recovery of commercial tree species over 30
   years following logging and thinning in a tropical rain forest},

Abstract = {Sustainable production of timber from commercial species across felling
   cycles is a core challenge for tropical silviculture. In this study, we
   analysed how the intensity and type (harvesting and thinning) of
   silvicultural interventions affect: (a) recruitment of small stems (5 cm
   <= DBH < 15 cm), (b) increment of future crop trees (15 cm <= DBH < 50
   cm) and (c) recovery of harvestable growing stocks (DBH >= 50 cm) of 52
   commercial timber species in the Tapajos National Forest, Brazil.
   Intervention intensities comprised logging (on average 61 m(3) ha(-1))
   and associated damage to remaining trees (1982) and thinning
   (refinement) to reduce basal area at the stand level (1993/1994). These
   interventions together resulted in a gradient of reduction in basal-area
   from 19 to 53\% relative to pre-logging stocks. Trees (DBH >= 5 cm) were
   measured on eight occasions in 41 permanent sample plots of 0.25 ha
   each. The dynamics were analysed at the stand level over 30 years and
   compared among treatments (including unlogged forest) and to pre-logging
   stands. Recruitment and growth temporarily increased following
   interventions and recovery of harvestable growing stock decreased with
   intervention intensity. Harvesting substantially increased recruitment
   of small stems relative to the unlogged forest, but recruitment rates
   decreased over time and did not increase following thinning. Gross
   increment of future crop trees was higher in logged than in unlogged
   forest and increased over time with high intensity of follow-up
   thinning, where it remained significantly higher than in control plots
   over time. Increased recruitment rates and volume increments were mainly
   driven by long-lived pioneer species, changing the composition of the
   growing stock. In 2012, recovery of harvestable growing stock of the 22
   species harvested in 1982 varied between 19\% and 57\% in logged
   treatments relative to pre-logging levels. When considering an
   additional group of 30 species that were not harvested in the permanent
   sample plots but are now potentially commercial, relative recovery
   increased enough to support a second harvest under the present
   regulations (maximum harvest of 30 m(3) ha(-1)), except for treatment
   with high thinning intensity where stocks were still less than 30\%
   relative to pre-harvest levels. In contrast, light and medium thinning
   intensity promoted recovery of harvestable growing stock. These findings
   indicate that intensive thinning should be avoided and silvicultural
   interventions oriented towards future crop trees of target species
   should be adopted. This may enhance recovery and reduce unintended
   changes in composition of the commercial growing stock. (C) 2016

   Soil OM aromaticity and hydrophobicity, assessed via C-13 nuclear

   post-fire land use altered the carbon distribution in sand, silt and

Abstract = {Recent discussions of local knowledge emphasize its dynamic nature
   invoking local peoples' ability to effectively integrate traditional or
   local with science-based or ``modern{''} knowledges. The smallholder
   timber industry of the Amazon's estuarine floodplain provides an
   outstanding example of local patterns of resource management and
   economic activities transformed from within by smallholder farmers who
   participated in the industrial timber boom of the 1970s and 1980s. These
   farmers of eastern Amazonia have developed a vertically integrated local
   industry based on expertise reflecting profound locally developed
   knowledge of specific forests and management of ecological processes,
   individual observation and experimentation, as well as concepts and
   practices derived from temporary employment by large- scale industrial
   timber firms. At each stage of the smallholder forestry process - from
   managing natural regeneration to running small sawmills and marketing
   lumber - local managers apply an innovative set of practices reflecting
   their diverse experiences. This combination of technical, market, and
   ecological knowledge results in forests, timber markets, and economic
   patterns that do not correspond to many of the widely- held
   generalizations concerning either local or industrial tropical timber
   exploitation. This article uses data from 7 years of research in the

Abstract = {Strategies to mitigate climate change by reducing deforestation and
   forest degradation ( e. g. REDD+) require country-or region-specific
   information on temporal changes in forest carbon ( C) pools to develop
   accurate emission factors. The soil C pool is one of the most important
   C reservoirs, but is rarely included in national forest reference
   emission levels due to a lack of data. Here, we present the soil organic
   C ( SOC) dynamics along 20 years of forest-to-pasture conversion in two
   subregions with different management practices during pasture
   establishment in the Colombian Amazon: high-grazing intensity ( HG) and
   low-grazing intensity ( LG) subregions. We determined the pattern of SOC
   change resulting from the conversion from forest ( C3 plants) to pasture
   ( C4 plants) by analysing total SOC stocks and the natural abundance of
   the stable isotopes C-13 along two 20-year chronosequences identified in
   each subregion. We also analysed soil N stocks and the natural abundance
   of N-15 during pasture establishment. In general, total SOC stocks at 30
   cm depth in the forest were similar for both subregions, with an average
   of 47.1 +/- 1.8 Mg C ha +/- 1 in HG and 48.7 +/- 3.1 Mg C ha +/- 1 in
   LG. However, 20 years after forest-to-pasture conversion SOC in HG
   decreased by 20\%, whereas in LG SOC increased by 41\%. This net SOC
   decrease in HG was due to a larger reduction in C3-derived input and to
   a comparatively smaller increase in C4-derived C input. In LG both C3-
   and C4-derived C input increased along the chronosequence. N stocks were
   generally similar in both subregions and soil N stock changes during
   pasture establishment were correlated with SOC changes. These results
   emphasize the importance of management practices involving low-grazing
   intensity in cattle activities to preserve SOC stocks and to reduce C
   emissions after land-cover change from forest to pasture in the
   Colombian Amazon.},

Abstract = {The results of ecological restoration techniques can be monitored
   through biological indicators of soil quality such as the leaf litter
   arthropod fauna. This study aimed to determine the immediate effect of
   brushwood transposition transferred from an area of native vegetation to
   a disturbed area, on the leaf litter arthropod fauna in a degraded
   cerrado area. The arthropod fauna of four areas was compared: a degraded
   area with signal grass, two experimental brushwood transposition areas,
   with and without castor oil plants, and an area of native cerrado. In
   total, 7,660 individuals belonging to 23 taxa were sampled. Acari and
   Collembola were the most abundant taxa in all studied areas, followed by
   Coleoptera, Diptera, Hemiptera, Hymenoptera, and Symphyla. The brushwood
   transposition area without castor oil plants had the lowest abundance
   and dominance and the highest diversity of all areas, providing evidence
   of changes in the soil community. Conversely, the results showed that
   the presence of castor oil plants hampered early succession, negatively
   affecting ecological restoration in this area.},

   and satellite images from 1962 to 2019 (i.e. 59 years). The structural
   study of community revealed high predominance of forest and generalist
   species when compared to savanna species. Non-linear correlation between
   CD expansion rates and total rainfall within the study period indicated
   a positive influence of the rainfall (R-2 = 0.42). Thus, our analysis
   indicated a tendency of a continuous and fast expansion of CD over areas

Abstract = {The recovery and survival of the Macaronesian laurel forest depends on
   its regeneration strategies. After years of long-term monitoring, both
   sexual and asexual regeneration appear to be equally important. However,
   the mechanisms for each are just beginning to be understood. In order to
   contribute to the understanding of the laurel forest sexual
   regeneration, we analyzed the species composition of the seedling bank
   every two weeks over three years in the laurel forest of Anaga
   (Tenerife, Canary Islands). We compared the species compositions of the
   seedling bank with the canopy, and analyzed changes in their diversity
   over this period in different forest stands. We found that species
   diversity (evenness) is different among plots regardless of the stand.
   In some cases, plot diversity remained constant over time, while others
   showed some variations, which were little related to climatic conditions
   (temperature and precipitation). We also found no relationship between
   the seedling bank and canopy composition, with shade-intolerant species
   being more abundant in the former. Although climatic conditions remained
   constant during the period and other environmental conditions did not
   vary either, some changes were found in the seedling bank species
   composition. These were related to the increased degree of conservation
   of the laurel forest of Anaga (by closing unpaved roads, limiting
   access, and the abandonment of agriculture) that had negatively affected
   the density of shade-intolerant species. We suggest that such
   conservation measures should be maintained and extended to other areas
   where agriculture has been recently abandoned to allow the potential
   establishment of laurel forest and late successional species.},

Title = {Vertical patterns of soil water uptake by plants in a primary forest and

Journal = {PLANT AND SOIL},
Year = {2000},
Volume = {222},
Number = {1-2},
Pages = {95-107},
Abstract = {This study evaluated the water uptake patterns of a primary forest and
   of the savanna-like vegetation of an abandoned pasture in an eastern
   Amazon site. We used natural stable isotope abundance in the soil
   profile, as well as plots irrigated with deuterated water to determine
   time and depth of soil water uptake by plants in different functional
   groups. Natural isotopic abundance was not suitable for identification
   of depth of water uptake by plants, but experiments using labeled water
   were. We found that the label percolation rate in the soil profile of
   the forest was lower than that observed in the pasture. Fourteen months
   after application, the label peak was located at 1.8 m depth in the
   forest and at 3 m depth in the pasture. Isotopic analysis of sap water
   from trees and lianas in the forest during the dry season showed that
   trees acquired labeled water at a deeper level in the soil profile
   compared to that acquired by lianas. Depth of water uptake by lianas
   seems to vary on a seasonal basis. In the pasture the `colonizer' shrub
   (Solanum crinitum Lamb.) took up labeled water only from the surface
   layer of the soil profile (similar to 20\%), whereas the most abundant
   coexisting grass (Panicum maximum Jacq.) acquired it from the top meter.
   None of the pasture plants were able to acquire labeled water after one
   rainy season when the label pulse was deep in the soil (> 1 m deep).
   These results have implications for studies of forest water cycle in
   which the soil volume used as source of water for plant transpiration is
   still unknown, and for an understanding of plant succession in the
   forest regeneration process of abandoned pastures in the eastern Amazon.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF SOUTH AMERICAN EARTH SCIENCES},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {46},
Pages = {150-160},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The Bananal Plain spreading on the Middle Araguaia River basin in
   Central Brazil at the Cerrado-Amazonia ecotone is a unique system that
   sustains the largest seasonal wetlands of the Cerrado biome. The huge
   Bananal Plain is an intracratonic sedimentary basin filled with
   Pleistocene sediments of the Araguaia formation. Covering approximately
   two million hectares, the Bananal Island is a major geomorphologic
   feature of the Bananal plain. Fieldwork and the analysis of a temporal
   series of MODIS-VI and Landsat ETM images allowed us to discriminate
   Cerrado phyto-physiognomies on the Bananal Island. Maps of vegetation
   and geomorphologic units were created, and from the correlation between
   landforms and vegetation types we identified morpho-vegetation units.
   Our approach allowed us to postulate that Pleistocene landforms strongly
   influence, if not dominate, the distribution of vegetation units.
   For example, the distribution of current gallery forest is not only
   controlled by active floodplains, but also by alluvial belts abandoned
   by avulsion. Additionally, arboreal Cerrado vegetation is supported by
   laterite developed on the sediments of the Araguaia Formation. Some of
   these inactive landforms are in part modified by the present day
   geomorphologic processes and colonized by successional vegetation that
   varies from alluvial forest to Cerrado.
   Characterized by a very flat landscape with a hindered drainage, the
   muddy sediments of the Araguaia Formation and the high seasonal rainfall
   favor the development of regional seasonal wetlands.
   The Bananal plain is a key area for understanding the Quaternary
   climatic and biogeographic changes in tropical South America. The
   control exerted by relict Quaternary landforms on the current vegetation
   units demonstrates the strong links between geomorphologic aspects of
   the landscape and ecological patterns. This multidisciplinary approach
   provides a better understanding of the biogeographic patterns in the
   Cerrado-Amazon ecotone, which is useful for identifying and designing
   areas for conservation. Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

   Eucalyptus plantations},
Journal = {FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {336},
Pages = {174-182},
Month = {JAN 15},
Abstract = {Managing for wildlife in human-dominated matrices outside natural
   reserves has great importance to improve the efficacy of conservation
   efforts aiming to protect and restore biodiversity. As such, it is
   critical to understand which features of the matrix enhance habitat
   suitability to the remaining species and also to evaluate species
   responses to alternative management practices. We used hierarchical
   modeling to estimate the effect of stand level management practices
   adopted in Eucalyptus plantations on site occupancy by birds while
   accounting for species detection failure. Our models incorporated
   site-specific traits, such as management practice type and landscape
   attributes of each sampling unit. They also incorporate species-specific
   traits, particularly main foraging stratum. The major factor associated
   with differences in site occupancy by birds within our study site is the
   management practice type. Scattered native trees and early successional
   stage understory within mature stands were associated with an increase
   in the proportion of bird species from the regional pool that was able
   to occupy the silvicultural matrix. Landscape attributes had a
   relatively minor effect on site occupancy in our study area. We
   concluded that site occupancy by birds is positively associated with
   increasing spatial complexity within Eucalyptus stands, with species
   responding to the retention of native scattered trees and understory
   presence. Forestry managers interested in improving the conservation
   value for birds of Eucalyptus plantations in tropical areas should
   maintain existing native trees and adopt practices that trigger
   understory regeneration during site preparation and stand rotation. (C)

Title = {Are abandoned grasslands within forest plantations effective for the
   conservation of grassland birds?},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF FIELD ORNITHOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {93},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {The decline and fragmentation of grasslands in recent years have
   stimulated efforts to preserve this ecosystem. However, even legally
   protected remnant grasslands are threatened by changes in the structure
   and composition of vegetation, which compromise their ecological
   functions. Shrub encroachment in grasslands is a global concern because
   it can reduce the occurrence of grassland birds. We evaluated the
   effectiveness of abandoned grassland areas under legal protection for
   the conservation of grassland avifauna, because the exclusion of
   disturbances, such as grazing and fire, favor the advancement of woody
   vegetation over grasslands. Birds were sampled during two periods in
   abandoned grasslands within farms of eucalyptus plantations. Significant
   differences in bird species composition were found between the two
   sampling periods as was a significant increase in species richness
   associated with shrubs and forests. There was no significant reduction
   in the number of grassland bird species between periods. Nineteen of the
   recorded species were recorded only in the second sampling period, of
   which only two are associated with grasslands. The results indicate that
   changes in vegetation mainly affect grassland specialist species and can
   lead to their local extinction in the long term. Furthermore, the
   studied grassland areas have, thus far, been effective for the
   conservation of birds. However, the results also demonstrate that the
   implementation of activities to manage woody vegetation can be a
   promising alternative for improving these areas for grassland birds over
   the medium and long term because shrub encroachment in these areas is
   evident.},

Journal = {OECOLOGIA},
Year = {1997},
Volume = {112},
Number = {3},

Abstract = {This study investigates some factors affecting the foraging activity of
   the leaf-cutting ant Atta laevigata. The study was conducted on an
   abandoned farm near Manaus, in Brazilian Amazonia, where forest was
   beginning to regenerate. I determined how temporal changes in the
   structure of the woody plant community (linked to the regeneration
   process) affected the leaf harvesting activity of this Neotropical ant.
   A 0.39-ha plot was established, and woody plants existing and emerging
   in this plot were identified, tagged, measured and mapped. At intervals
   of approximately 14 days all marked plants were checked to determine
   which had been attacked by A. laevigata during that period. Woody plant
   density doubled over the 18-months of the study. However, the number of
   plants attacked by A. laevigata, controlling for seasonal differences in
   ant activity, was independent of the number available for attack. The
   number of plants attacked was also independent of the number of new
   plants emerged in the previous 2 months. Apart from changes in total
   plant density, the relative abundance of most species also changed with
   time. Data on the composition of the plant community and on the
   composition of the ants' diet at different time intervals were subject
   to ordination analysis. The analyses revealed that successional changes
   in the composition of the woody plant community did significantly affect
   the composition of the leaf diet of A. laevigata. Variations in the
   ants' diet correlated most strongly with variations in the abundance of
   Bellucia imperialis. As this increased in abundance its relative
   contribution to the ants' diet increased. In addition, I observed a
   small decline in the diversity of plant resources exploited by the ants.
   B. imperialis was one of the species most preferred by A. laevigata,
   suggesting that variations in the diversity of its diet were related to
   the abundance of preferred species. The chances of an individual plant
   being attacked was independent of whether or not the plant had been
   attacked during the previous 5 months. This suggests that plant
   resistance against ant herbivory is not affected by previous damage. Two
   other lines of evidence also pointed to this. First, there was no
   significant difference in the leaf area cut (as measured during assays
   of leaf preference with A. laevigata) between leaves of plants that had
   been subject to artificial defoliation 3 mo earlier and those of control
   plants. Second, the number of attacks by A. laevigata on individuals of
   a given species usually followed a random distribution, even though a
   uniform or clumped distribution would have been expected under the
   hypothesis that damage by leaf-cutting ants affects the plant's
   resistance to further damage.},

Abstract = {Understanding the dynamics of forest regeneration on abandoned
   agricultural land in the Amazon has often been restricted by limited
   knowledge of historical land use. This study compared time-series
   classifications of mature forest, nonforest, and regrowth generated from
   Landsat sensor data for areas north of the Brazilian cities of Manaus
   (1973-2003) and Santarem (1984-2003) to chronicle land histories and
   forest age. At Manaus, active land use prior to abandonment ranged from
   <1 year with no burning to >10-15 years with burning. Few forests were
   recleared on more than three occasions. From the mid-1980s, land was
   increasingly abandoned and, in 2003, over 75\% of the deforested area
   supported regenerating forests, with several being older than 20 years.
   South of Santarem, forests were cleared up to seven times. In 2003, few
   regenerating forests were older than 10 years, and all land covers, but
   particularly mature forest, were damaged by extensive wildfires in 1993
   and 1998. Based on previous research, the study concludes that the
   capacity of regenerating forests to recover biomass and tree species
   diversity will be reduced where prior land use is more intense, as in

Title = {High levels of genetic diversity through pollen flow of the coniferous
   Araucaria angustifolia: a landscape level study in Southern
   Brazil},
Journal = {TREE GENETICS \& GENOMES},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {11},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {In this study, genetic diversity, inbreeding, spatial genetic structure
   (SGS), and pollen dispersal are analyzed using ten microsatellite loci
   from two populations of the dioecious, wind-pollinated, coniferous tree
   Araucaria angustifolia in Southern Brazil. The study populations include
   an undisturbed 7 ha A. angustifolia cluster, where all adult trees were
   mapped and sampled, and an adjacent, long-abandoned, open agricultural
   area with an aggregated A. angustifolia population. Seeds were collected
   from 13 seed trees inside the forest cluster and from eight seed trees
   in the open forest. Our results showed that the adults present high
   levels of heterozygosity (H-o=0.91) and an absence of inbreeding.
   However, significant SGS was detected up to 90 m in the forest cluster
   suggesting that near-neighbor trees are related. The estimate of
   effective population size was lower than the total number of trees in
   the cluster (N-e/N=0.19), which can be explained by the presence of SGS
   in the stand. Substantial external pollen flow was detected in the
   forest cluster (26 \%) and open forest (20 \%), indicating that the
   reproductive population size is greater than the sampled populations,
   explaining the high genetic diversity in this population. Our results
   indicate that this site has potential for in and ex situ conservation
   due to high levels of genetic diversity and gene immigration resulting
   from pollen flow. Conservation strategies for A. angustifolia should
   focus not only on forest fragments but should also include the
   preservation of isolated trees throughout the landscape.},

Volume = {25},
Number = {11},
Pages = {2021-2034},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Neotropical rainforests are global biodiversity hotspots and are
   challenging to restore. A core part of this challenge is the very long
   recovery trajectory of the system: recovery of structure can take 20-190
   years, species composition 60-500 years, and reestablishment of
   rare/endemic species thousands of years. Passive recovery may be fraught
   with instances of arrested succession, disclimax or emergence of novel
   ecosystems. In these cases, active restoration methods are essential to
   speed recovery and set a desired restoration trajectory. Tree plantation
   is the most common active approach to reestablish a high density of
   native tree species and facilitate understory regeneration. While this
   approach may speed the successional trajectory, it may not achieve, and
   possibly inhibit, a long-term restoration trajectory towards the high
   species diversity characteristic of these forests. A range of nucleation
   techniques (e.g., tree island planting) are important restoration
   options: although they may not speed recovery of structure as quickly as
   plantations, their emphasis on natural regeneration processes may enable
   greater and more natural patterns of diversity to develop. While more
   work needs to be done to compare forest restoration techniques in
   different environmental contexts, it appears that nucleation and, at
   times, passive restoration may best preserve the diverse legacy of these
   forested systems (both with lower costs). An integrated approach using
   both plantation productivity but also the natural functions associated
   with nucleation may develop composition and diversity trajectory desired
   in Neotropical conservation efforts.},

Abstract = {The restoration of cattle grazing areas is a significant challenge for
   tropical forest restoration because of the effects of soil degradation
   and the competition between native trees and exotic grasses. To identify
   the major factors that impede forest restoration efforts, we examined
   the effects of different grass species, soil types and management
   techniques on the outcome of two species of tree seedlings in abandoned
   pastures. We compared the initial (12 months) seedling survival rates
   and growth of a fast-growing tree( Inga edulis) and a slow-growing tree
   (Campomanesia xanthocarpa), growing in Cambisols and Gleysols, using
   different management practices (till vs. no-till) and in the presence of
   two exotic grass species. Soil conditions were the most significant
   factor for influencing seedling performance, for both species; the grass
   species used in the pasture was less important. The flooding conditions
   in Gleysols may have potentially limited the seedling growth by
   affecting the height and diameter of C. xanthocarpa. Our results support
   the claim that soil conditions are the primary factors that negatively
   affect the growth and survival of native tree seedlings in abandoned
   farmlands. Restoration efforts that employ fast-growing native species
   should be chosen to increase the chances of restoration success in wet
   pasture areas. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier GmbH.},

   macrophylla King to integrate genetic diversity into management
   strategies in Southwestern Amazon},
Journal = {FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {464},
Month = {MAY 15},
Abstract = {The aims of this study were to investigate the intrapopulation spatial
   genetic structure (SGS) of a preserved Swietenia macrophylla population
   in a managed forest in Southwestern Amazon, in Acre state, Brazil, and
   assess the genetic parameters that underlie the conceptual framework
   that guides conservation and management strategies. The study was
   conducted in Annual Production Unit (APU) 3, where 83 adult trees (DBH
   >= 40 cm) were mapped (1650 ha). The diameter at breast height (DBH) was
   measured and the vascular exchange was sampled. Leaf tissues were
   collected from 187 juvenile individuals within a radius of 20 m of
   adults. The population presented high heterozygosity (H-o) for adult
   (0.767) and juvenile (0.763) individuals, but significantly high allelic
   richness (R) and significantly lower fixation index (F) in adults (R =
   10.3, F = 0.048) than juveniles (R = 9.3, F= 0.119). The F value
   significantly higher for juveniles, suggesting selection against inbred
   individuals between juvenile and adult life stages. SGS was detected for
   adults up to 300 m. Mating was mainly through outcrossing (0.97-1.0),
   but some crossing occurred among related trees (0.02-0.16) and were
   correlated (r(pm) = 0.06-0.22), indicating a mean effective number of
   pollen donors ranging from 4.5 to 18.2. Pollen dispersal distances
   reached 3905 m (mean of 1472 m), and mean effective pollination neighbor
   area of 792 ha. The effective population size (N-e) within family (2.73)
   was lower than expected for random mating populations. The number of
   trees (m) required for seed collection was estimated at 55 non-inbreed
   and not related trees to each other. The core collection consisted of 42
   (50.6\%) adults across the area. These individuals should be included in
   seed collection as they represent 100\% of the total detected genetic
   diversity. The inclusion of S. macrophylla on the list of species
   available for exploitation is not indicated, because the species
   requires cross breeding for its maintenance and logging reduce the N-e
   and may negatively impact the pattern of genetic diversity. These will
   significantly increase the risk of genetic erosion and population
   extinction due to a lack of adaptive ability. Adults serve as pollen
   donors that ecologically and genetically contribute to the maintenance
   of gene flow and N-e. Because it is recognized as a threatened species
   worldwide, and due to the fact that in areas of natural occurrence the
   species presents low-density and shows difficulty establishing natural
   regeneration, we recommend that S. macrophylla be protected from
   selective logging.},

   were critical. The areas of greatest uncertainty for the FSU and US
   analyses related to the rates of woody debris and soil organic matter
   accumulation and to limitations in the age-class based inventory data
   available. In Brazil, the initial biomass in forests subject to
   deforestation, and the area of recovering secondary forest, were
   identified as important research issues. Continued database development,

Abstract = {To assess the impacts of land-use changes on plant-available water (PAW)
   and evapotranspiration (ET), volumetric water content (VWC) was measured
   to 8 m beneath three, adjacent ecosystems for four years (1991-1994).
   Estimates of PAW, ET, and deep drainage were generated for mature
   evergreen forest, adjacent pasture, and capoeira (second-growth forest
   on abandoned pasture land). PAW between 0 and 8 m depth for forest,
   pasture, and capoeira ranged from a low of 56, 400, and 138 mm at the
   end of the 1992 dry season to a high of 941, 1116, and 1021 mm during
   the 1994 wet season. We found significant differences in deep (4-8 m)
   stocks of PAW when comparing pasture with both forest types. In
   contrast, mature forest and capoeira PAW were not significantly
   different from one another at any depth during the experiment. In all
   three ecosystems available soil moisture from 4-8 m was depleted during
   the 1991 dry season by plant water uptake and was not recharged to 1991
   levels until 1994 due to an intervening 2-year, El Nino Southern
   Oscillation event. Water balance estimates (based on measurements to 8
   m) showed an average 10\% decrease in ET from pasture compared to mature
   forest. Less than 15 years after pasture abandonment, ET in
   second-growth forest recovered to rates nearly equaling the mature
   forest rate. In seasonally dry environments annual and interannual
   cycles of deep soil moisture recharge and depletion influence rates of
   transpiration and drainage. These deep cycles are not currently
   incorporated in models of regional and global moisture flux.},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Replanting trees helps with avoiding desertification, reducing the
   chances of soil erosion and flooding, minimizing the risks of zoonotic
   disease outbreaks, and providing ecosystem services and livelihood to
   the indigenous people, in addition to sequestering carbon dioxide for
   mitigating climate change. Consequently, it is important to explore new
   methods and technologies that are aiming to upscale and fast-track
   afforestation and reforestation (A/R) endeavors, given that many of the
   current tree planting strategies are not cost effective over large
   landscapes, and suffer from constraints associated with time, energy,
   manpower, and nursery-based seedling production. UAV (unmanned aerial
   vehicle)-supported seed sowing (UAVsSS) can promote rapid A/R in a safe,
   cost-effective, fast and environmentally friendly manner, if performed
   correctly, even in otherwise unsafe and/or inaccessible terrains,
   supplementing the overall manual planting efforts globally. In this
   study, we reviewed the recent literature on UAVsSS, to analyze the
   current status of the technology. Primary UAVsSS applications were found
   to be in areas of post-wildfire reforestation, mangrove restoration,
   forest restoration after degradation, weed eradication, and desert
   greening. Nonetheless, low survival rates of the seeds, future forest
   diversity, weather limitations, financial constraints, and seed-firing
   accuracy concerns were determined as major challenges to
   operationalization. Based on our literature survey and qualitative
   analysis, twelve recommendations-ranging from the need for publishing
   germination results to linking UAVsSS operations with carbon offset
   markets-are provided for the advancement of UAVsSS applications.},

Abstract = {The Brazilian Caatinga belongs to the dry forests biome and is
   threatened due to the conversion of natural areas for anthropogenic
   uses. An alternative for the recovery of these areas is to plant
   generalist seedlings, which when inoculated with arbuscular mycorrhizal
   fungi (AMF), can accelerate the process of ecological succession. The
   objective of this study was to evaluate the responsiveness of Mimosa
   tenuiflora (Willd.) Poir. to inoculation with AMF at different doses of
   phosphorus (P) fertilization. The experiment was completely randomized
   in a factorial arrangement with three inoculation treatments
   (noninoculated and inoculated with Claroideoglomus etunicatum, C. Walker
   \& A. Schuussler, emend. Oehl, Sieverd., B. T. Goto \& G. A. Silva or
   Fuscutata heterogama, Oehl, F. A. Souza, L. C. Maia \& Sieverd), four
   doses of single superphosphate (SSP) (0, 22, 66, and 155 mg L-1) in
   seven replicates. The following parameters were evaluated: height, stem
   diameter, above-and below-ground biomass, mycorrhizal colonization,
   number of glomerospores (NG), and shoot nutrient concentration. In
   general, mycorrhizal plants had higher average height and stem diameter
   than non-mycorrhizal plants. There was a growth increment of over 200 \%
   in plants inoculated with C. etunicatum or F. heterogama in the soil
   without application of SSP. The addition of SSP reduced root
   colonization by the isolates of AMF applied. For the NG, it was observed
   that F. heterogama produced more glomerospores in natural soil, with NG
   decreasing above 100 mg L-1 of P in the soil. Plants of mycorrhizal M.

Abstract = {Soil is the principal habitat and reservoir of fungi that act on
   ecological processes vital for life on Earth. Understanding soil fungal
   community structures and the patterns of species distribution is
   crucial, considering climatic change and the increasing anthropic
   impacts affecting nature. We evaluated the soil fungal diversity in
   southeastern Brazil, in a transitional region that harbors patches of
   distinct biomes and ecoregions. The samples originated from eight
   habitats, namely: semi-deciduous forest, Brazilian savanna, pasture,
   coffee and sugarcane plantation, abandoned buildings, owls' and
   armadillos' burrows. Forty-four soil samples collected in two periods
   were evaluated by metagenomic approaches, focusing on the
   high-throughput DNA sequencing of the ITS2 rDNA region in the Illumina
   platform. Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) was used for
   vegetation cover analysis. NDVI values showed a linear relationship with
   both diversity and richness, reinforcing the importance of a healthy
   vegetation for the establishment of a diverse and complex fungal
   community. The owls' burrows presented a peculiar fungal composition,
   including high rates of Onygenales, commonly associated with keratinous
   animal wastes, and Trichosporonales, a group of basidiomycetous yeasts.
   Levels of organic matter and copper influenced all guild communities
   analyzed, supporting them as important drivers in shaping the fungal
   communities' structures.},

Abstract = {The objective of this study was to assess the effects of forest
   harvesting on physical attributes of the soil in a stand of Eucalyptus
   saligna Smith. abandoned for 40 years. The three treatments were: CCV
   conventional harvesting with mechanized extraction; CIR1 - reduced
   impact harvesting with mechanized extraction; and CIR2 -reduced impact
   harvesting for firewood associated with animal extraction (DBH <= 30 cm)
   and with mechanized extraction for logs (DAP > 30 cm). The variables of
   soil effects were: (i) four classes of surface disturbances
   (m(2).ha(-1)): ``no-disturbances{''}, ``light{''}, ``moderate{''} and
   ``severe disturbances{''}; (ii) cone penetrometer resistance (MPa); and
   (iii) bulk density variation (g.cm(-3)). Soil compaction was detected at
   mechanized extraction and in areas with moderate and severe
   disturbances. The treatments CIR1 and CIR2 had lower averages of
   moderate and severe disturbances; 1.151 m(2).ha(-1) and 1.094
   m(2).ha(-1) respectively, differentiating them statistically from CCV
   that presented 2.620 m(2).ha(-1). The use of a reduced impact harvesting
   system significantly minimized the total area with critical soil
   compaction for plants development and, therefore, is an environmentally
   viable alternative to logging in abandoned stands of Eucalyptus and for
   forest management in legal reserve.},

Journal = {REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2002},
Volume = {80},

Abstract = {We combined a detailed Field study of forest canopy damage with
   calibrated Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) reflectance
   data and texture analysis to assess the sensitivity of basic broadband
   optical remote sensing to selective logging in Amazonia. Our Field study
   encompassed measurements of ground damage and canopy gap fractions along
   a chronosequence of postharvest regrowth of 0.5 - 3.5 years. We found
   that canopy damage and regrowth rates varied according to the logging
   method used, either conventional logging or reduced impact logging.
   Areas used to stage felled trees prior to transport, log decks, had the
   largest gap fractions immediately following cutting. Log decks were
   quickly colonized by early successional plant species, resulting in
   significant gap fraction decreases within 1.5 years after site
   abandonment. Although log decks were the most obvious damage areas on
   the ground and in satellite imagery, they accounted for only 1-2\% of
   the total harvested area of the blocks studied. Other forest damage
   features such as tree-fall gaps, skid trails, and roads were difficult
   to recognize in Landsat reflectance data or through textural analysis.
   These landscape features could be only crudely resolved in the most
   intensively logged forests and within about 0.5 years following harvest.
   We found that forest damage within any of the landscape strata (decks,
   roads, skids, tree falls) could not be resolved with Landsat reflectance
   or texture data when the canopy gap fraction was < 50\%. The basic
   Landsat ETM+ imagery lacks the resolution of forest structural features
   required for quantitative studies of logging damage. Landsat textural
   analyses may be useful for broad delineation of logged forests, but
   detailed ecological and biogeochemical studies will probably need to
   rely on other remote sensing approaches. Until spatial gradients of
   canopy damage and regrowth resulting from selective logging operations
   in tropical forests in the Amazon region are resolved, the impacts of
   this land use on a continental scale will remain poorly understood. (C)

Abstract = {The objective of this study is to evaluate the relationship between the

   The microwave signals from the P-band polarimetric images were related
   to the aboveground biomass data by statistical regression models
   (logarithmic and polynomial functions). In the field survey,
   physiognomic and structural aspects of primary forest and regrowth were
   collected and afterwards the biomass was estimated using allometric
   equations based on dendrometric, parameters. As an example of the
   potential use of P-band polarimetric images, they were classified by a
   contextual classifier (ICM), whose thematic stratification of land

   undulating and strongly undulating relief, with east-oriented elevations
   ranging from 300 to 450 m. The forest coverage maps showed an increase
   of 50.4\% forest cover between 1985 and 2014. Most of this increase took
   place on undulating and strongly undulating terrain, possibly due to the

Abstract = {The aim of this study was to determine the productive and metabolic
   response in Chilota lambs grazing Calafatal or naturalized pasture. The
   experiment was conducted at the Experimental Station Butalcura (INIA,
   Chilo,) during October, November, and December 2011. Eight Chilota and
   six Suffolk Down 2-month-old lambs, uncastrated males, no twin, were
   located to graze a typical secondary succession of the Chilo,
   Archipelago, as a Calafatal (a secondary succession which derivates from
   human intervention on native forest in Chilo, Archipelago).
   Simultaneously, eight male 2-month-old Chilota lambs were located to
   graze a naturalized pasture, another secondary succession derived from
   human intervention on native forest in Chilo, Archipelago. Animals had
   free access to water sources. Measurements were performed one time a
   month, for three consecutive months for productive indicators: live
   weight, average daily gain and body condition score, and blood
   indicators of protein and energetic metabolism. Productive and metabolic
   response was similar between both types of pastures (P > 0.05). However,
   Chilota and Suffolk Down lambs grazing Calafatal showed higher plasma
   concentrations of beta OH-butyrate, but lower non-esterified fatty acids
   (NEFA) than Chilota lambs grazing naturalized pasture (P < 0.05).
   Chilota lambs grazing naturalized pasture showed the highest plasma
   concentrations of NEFA and urea (P < 0.05). It was concluded that, under
   the conditions of the study, Chilota lambs grazing naturalized pasture,
   which had higher contents of crude protein and metabolizable energy,
   showed better metabolic balance, but not performance, than Chilota and

Abstract = {In this study, seedling growth and herbivory were monitored during the
   first 4 years of plot development in a large-scale reforestation
   experiment in Brazil's Atlantic Rainforest (Mata Atlantica). Seedlings
   were planted in a factorial design testing two levels of density, three
   levels of diversity, and the presence or absence of pioneer species at
   the Reserva Natural Vale in the Brazilian state of Espirito Santo. In
   addition, we studied the effect of herbivory on seedling growth and the
   potential for plant defenses to limit herbivory. Seedling growth was
   higher in the low-density plantings, and seedlings attained the greatest
   height in the low-diversity plots, which had a higher density of
   fast-growing species. The inclusion of pioneer species resulted in a
   significant decrease in the growth of neighboring seedlings.
   Interactions between herbivory, plant defenses, and seedling growth were
   complex. In general, defenses such as saponins and leaf toughness
   reduced herbivory, but when herbivory was high, seedling growth was
   reduced. Across treatments, mean height without herbivore damage was
   240.8 cm, and with 50\% herbivory mean height was 101.5 cm. Overall, to
   limit insect damage and promote seedling success, plant defense
   characteristics and ecological interactions should be carefully

Abstract = {Erythrina velutina ({''}mulungu{''}) is a legume tree from Caatinga that
   associates with rhizobia but the diversity and symbiotic ability of
   ``mulungu{''} rhizobia are poorly understood. The aim of this study was
   to characterize ``mulungu{''} rhizobia from Caatinga. Bacteria were
   obteined from Serra Talhad a and Caruaru in Caatinga under natural
   regeneration. The bacteria were evaluated to the amplification of nifH
   and nodC and to metabolic characteristics. Ten selected bacteria
   identified by 16S rRNA sequences. They were tested in vitro to NaCl and
   temperature tolerance, auxin production and calcium phosphate
   solubilization. The symbiotic ability were assessed in an greenhouse
   experiment. A total of 32 bacteria were obtained and 17 amplified both
   symbiotic genes. The bacteria showed a high variable metabolic profile.
   Bradyrhizobium (6), Rhizobium (3) and Paraburkholderia (1) were
   identified, differing from their geographic origin. The isolates grew up
   to 45 degrees C to 0.51 mol L-1 of NaCl. Bacteria which produced more
   auxin in the medium with L-tryptophan and two Rhizobium and one
   Bradyrhizobium were phosphate solubilizers. All bacteria nodulated and
   ESA 90 (Rhizobium sp.) plus ESA 96 (Paraburkholderia sp.) were more
   efficient symbiotically. Diverse and efficient rhizobia inhabit the
   soils of Caatinga dry forests, with the bacterial differentiation by the

   scarification and exposure of roots around the harvested trees stumps,
   at 5, 6, 7, and 8 weeks after cutting, i.e., four treatments with four
   repetitions of 50m? plots each. In the first months, adventitious buds
   sprouting from the roots have been observed inside and outside the
   perimeter around stumps. The area remained fenced, without thinning or
   application of fertilizers and, until the third year, the selective
   clearing was done to eliminate weed competition. Six years after the
   treatment, measurements of diameter at 1.30 m height (DBH) the height of
   the sprouts, and the circumference at soil height (CSH) of stumps were
   taken.
   Results: After six years, the regenerated site under simple coppice
   system presented a density of eatablished plants 216\% higher than the
   harvested site using a high forest system (first cycle), but with only
   4.3\% of the commercial volume. The correlation between the density of
   sprouts and the density of stumps indicated that initial plant density
   can influence the number of sprouts after harvest.
   Conclusion: It was verified the simple coppice system feasibility and
   that scarification technique can be applied up to eight weeks after tree
   cutting.},

Title = {LAND COVER EFFECTS ON REGENERANTS DENSITY AND RICHNESS IN RESTORATION
   TREATMENTS IN THE ATLANTIC RAINFOREST BIOME},
Journal = {REVISTA ARVORE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {48},
Abstract = {There is good evidence that the results of a restoration program depend
   largely on the landscape context. In restoration projects, it is crucial
   to consider the previous land uses and covers and landscape
   configuration as they have a significant impact on the entire process,
   especially seed dispersal and natural regeneration of sites. Thus, the
   objective of this work was to verify the effect of landscape (i.e., land
   use) on restoration success of total planting, seed sowing and natural
   regeneration sites in the Atlantic Forest biome, southeast Brazil. The
   methodology employed was based on demonstration units of restoration.
   The focus was on regenerant richness and abundance indicators, along
   with land use and land cover data (class area) from 2010, 2015, and
   2020, obtained from the MapBiomas Project. Generalized linear models and
   correlation analysis were used for the study. We hypothesize that a
   landscape with more forest and natural regeneration cover (mosaic of
   agriculture and pasture) would positively affect regenerants in restored
   sites, which we only observed for natural regeneration treatment sites.
   In active restoration treatment sites, mosaic of agriculture and pasture
   was negatively and farming was positively associated to regenerants. We
   also found greater density and richness of regenerants in natural
   regeneration treatment sites than in seed sowing and seedling planting.
   The influence of the surrounding landscape, particularly mosaic, played
   a crucial role in this success. In addition, land use cover history, as
   we observed in classes in the last five and ten years, did explain
   regenerants in studied sites. Thus, results show that the
   characterization of landscape context and previous land-use history is
   essential to understand the limitations to succession and define
   cost-effective restoration strategies.},

Abstract = {This study explores the relationships between forest cover change and
   the village resettlement and land planning policies implemented in Laos,
   which have led to the relocation of remote and dispersed populations
   into clustered villages with easier access to state services and market
   facilities. We used the Global Forest Cover Change (2000-2012) and the
   most recent Lao Agricultural Census (2011) datasets to assess forest
   cover change in resettled and non-resettled villages throughout the
   country. We also reviewed a set of six case studies and performed an
   original case study in two villages of Luang Prabang province with 55
   households, inquiring about relocation, land losses and intensification
   options. Our results show that resettled villages have greater baseline
   forest cover and total forest loss than most villages in Laos but not
   significant forest loss relative to that baseline. Resettled villages
   are consistently associated with forested areas, minority groups, and
   intermediate accessibility. The case studies highlight that resettlement
   coupled with land use planning does not necessarily lead to the
   abandonment of shifting cultivation or affect forest loss but lead to a
   re-spatialization of land use. This includes clustering of forest
   clearings, which might lead to fallow shortening and land degradation
   while limited intensification options exist in the resettled villages.
   This study provides a contribution to studying relationships between
   migration, forest cover change, livelihood strategies, land governance
   and agricultural practices in tropical forest environments.},

Year = {2019},
Volume = {93},
Number = {4},
Pages = {1409-1421},

Abstract = {Agroforestry systems (AFS) are important agricultural land use in
   synergy with socio-environmental aspects, especially with cacao
   (Theobroma cacao L.) crop, a commodity mainly produced by smallholders
   in the humid tropics. In southern Para, Brazilian Amazon, farmers manage
   native shade trees growing with cacao, but species selection may be not
   appropriate to AFS maintenance over time. The objective of this study
   was to understand the shade trees transition between successional
   management phases of cacao-AFS, considering its initial shade (IS) and
   secondary shade (SS). It was sampled 10 plots in each situation
   (20,000m(2) in total) identifying individuals with CBH >= 15cm. As
   expected, floristic composition was different and SS had greater species
   richness and diversity than IS, where only 17\% of species were the
   shared among them. Musa sp. and Carica papaya L. were found only in IS
   and were dominant species, representing almost a half of the
   individuals. Although there was increase of late succession species from
   IS to SS, this still keeps high abundance of early succession species,
   such as Cecropia sp. The result shows an unexploited potential products
   and gap of services provision, such as N-fixing. The conclusion
   highlights the necessity of long-term succession planning and management
   practices to guarantee cacao crop maintenance and improve
   diversification with other income sources, such as fruits and wood. The
   role of biodiversity conservation, provided by shade trees, should be
   the target of political strategies to encourage its maintenance, such as
   payment for ecosystems services or other economic incentives.},

Abstract = {The conservation and restoration of native vegetation around springs is
   extremely important to guarantee and maintain the quality and quantity

   (urbanization and mining) in the C \& oacute;rrego de Fechos microbasin

   of the springs and their surroundings was carried out, based on several
   parameters, such as: forms of land use, conservation status of tree
   vegetation, natural regeneration, litter, occurrence of invasive species
   and soil conservation status. The definition of the best forest
   restoration alternatives was carried out by applying the analytical key
   by Brancalion et al. (2015). Among the springs evaluated, 07 were
   classified as little disturbed, 02 as very disturbed and only 01 as
   degraded, with no spring being diagnosed as preserved. As restoration
   strategies, favoring the natural regeneration of native species and
   densification for those springs classified as little or very disturbed
   are recommended, with enrichment indicated as an additional strategy for
   those that are very disturbed. As for the spring that is degraded, the
   introduction of native species in the total area is recommended, with
   the need to use high species richness.},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {AimWe developed a set of statistical models to improve spatial estimates
   of mangrove aboveground biomass (AGB) based on the environmental
   signature hypothesis (ESH). We hypothesized that higher tidal
   amplitudes, river discharge, temperature, direct rainfall and decreased
   potential evapotranspiration explain observed high mangrove AGB.
   LocationNeotropics and a small portion of the Nearctic region.
   MethodsA universal forest model based on site-level forest structure
   statistics was validated to spatially interpolate estimates of mangrove
   biomass at different locations. Linear models were then used to predict
   mangrove AGB across the Neotropics.
   ResultsThe universal forest site-level model was effective in estimating
   mangrove AGB using pre-existing mangrove forest structure inventories to
   validate the model. We confirmed our hypothesis that at continental
   scales higher tidal amplitudes contributed to high forest biomass
   associated with high temperature and rainfall, and low potential
   evapotranspiration. Our model explained 20\% of the spatial variability
   in mangrove AGB, with values ranging from 16.6 to 627.0t ha(-1) (mean,
   88.7t ha(-1)). Our findings show that mangrove AGB has been
   overestimated by 25-50\% in the Neotropics, underscoring a commensurate
   bias in current published global estimates using site-level information.
   Main conclusionsOur analysis show how the ESH significantly explains
   spatial variability in mangrove AGB at hemispheric scales. This finding
   is critical to improve and explain site-level estimates of mangrove AGB
   that are currently used to determine the relative contribution of
   mangrove wetlands to global carbon budgets. Due to the lack of a
   conceptual framework explicitly linking environmental drivers and
   mangrove AGB values during model validation, previous works have
   significantly overestimated mangrove AGB; our novel approach improved
   these assessments. In addition, our framework can potentially be applied
   to other forest-dominated ecosystems by allowing the retrieval of
   extensive databases at local levels to generate more robust statistical
   predictive models to estimate continental-scale biomass values.},

Title = {Understorey vegetation gradient in a Eucalyptus grandis
   plantation between a savanna and a semideciduous forest},
Journal = {NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF FORESTRY SCIENCE},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {44},
Month = {JUN 18},
Abstract = {Background: Plant community assemblage is influenced by many factors,
   including soil characteristics and the arrival of diaspores from
   surrounding areas. These factors may be especially important in
   transition areas, leading to spatial gradients in the plant community.
   Methods: This study was performed in the understorey of an abandoned
   Eucalyptus grandis W. Hill ex Maiden plantation between a savanna and a
   forest, 490 m apart, in south-eastern Brazil. This study assessed
   whether the spatial variation in several variables related to the
   understorey's structure and composition is best described by linear or
   non-linear (quadratic) models. The linear model would indicate a
   gradient between the two vegetation types, whereas the quadratic model
   would indicate a stronger effect of the plantation's edges.
   Results: There was a gradient in species composition between the two
   edges of the plantation. Mean vegetation height was greatest at the
   savanna edge and lowest in the centre of the plantation. The total
   number of individuals per plot and the phylogenetic diversity decreased
   with distance from the savanna edge. Different patterns were observed
   for different dispersal syndromes, with animal dispersal being more
   common at the savanna edge, wind dispersal in the centre of the
   plantation and self dispersal at the forest edge.
   Conclusions: The greater number of individuals at the savanna edge may
   indicate that dispersal and arrival of diaspores are the most important
   factors influencing community structure and composition of the
   understorey of this abandoned E. grandis plantation, with most
   propagules coming from the savanna area. The smaller vegetation height
   in the centre of the fragment may also indicate older colonisation at
   the edges. Therefore, in addition to highlighting the recovery potential
   of undergrowth beneath abandoned Eucalyptus spp. plantations, these
   results show that this recovery is spatially heterogeneous and that
   dispersal plays a large role in it. This should be taken into account in
   restoration projects. The authors recommend careful consideration before
   removing regenerating Eucalyptus spp. trees as part of the site
   restoration. Instead the focus should be on the recovery potential of
   the undergrowth, with gradual removal of Eucalyptus trees, if necessary.},

Abstract = {Ant fauna (Hymenoptera, Fornncidae) associated to arboreal nests of
   Nasutitermes spp. (Isoptera, Termitidae) in a cacao plantation in
   southeastern Bahia, Brazil. Ants are among the most common arthropods
   that colonize termite nests. The aim of this study was to identify the
   ant fauna associated to termite nests found in a cacao plantation in the
   county of Ilheus, Bahia, Brazil, with emphasis on the fauna that uses
   the nests as foraging and/or nesting environment. For this purpose, 34
   active, decadent and abandoned nests of Nasutitermes corniger, N.
   ephratae and Nasutitermes sp., with different volumes and degrees of
   activity, were dissected. A total of 54 ant species, belonging to 23
   genera and five subfamilies, was found in the constructions. The active,
   decadent and abandoned termite nests presented, respectively, six, eight
   and 48 ant species. Crematogaster acuta and Ectatomma tuberculatum were
   the most frequent species in the active and decadent nests,
   respectively, while the most frequent species in the abandoned nests
   were Solenopsis pollux, Thaumatomyrmex contumax and Thaumatomyrmex sp.
   Twenty-six ant species had true colonies within the termitaria. The
   Formicidae species richness in the nests was inversely related to the
   degree of termite activity in the nests. The occurrence of living,
   decadent or abandoned termitaria of Nasutitermes spp. in cacao
   plantations foments the heterogeneity of habitats available in the
   plantations and favors the maintenance of high diversity of organisms
   that use obligatory or opportunistically this substrate.},

Abstract = {Amazon tropical forests are being replaced by pasturelands and
   croplands, but they sometimes revert to regrowth forest when abandoned
   after a period of agricultural use. Research suggests that this
   secondary regrowth is limited by climate and nutrient availability and,
   using a coupled biosphere-atmosphere model, we investigated patterns in
   the regrowth of the Amazon rainforest after a full deforestation event,
   considering different types of nutrient stress. We found that, over a 50
   year regrowth period, the reduction of precipitation caused by
   large-scale deforestation was not sufficient to prevent secondary forest
   regrowth, but this decrease in precipitation combined with nutrient
   limitation, due to logging and frequent fires, did indeed prevent forest
   regrowth in central and southern Amazonia, leading to a savannization.
   These results are concerning, as the northern Mato Grosso region has the
   highest clearing rate in Amazonia. The low resilience of the forest
   under nutrient stress indicates that a large scale disturbance could
   greatly expand the area suitable for cropland, accelerating forest

Abstract = {Monitoring changes in land use intensity of grazing systems in the
   Amazon is an important prerequisite to study the complex political and
   socio-economic forces driving Amazonian deforestation. Remote sensing
   offers the potential to map pasture vegetation over large areas, but
   mapping pasture conditions consistently through time is not a trivial
   task because of seasonal changes associated with phenology and data gaps
   from clouds and cloud shadows. In this study, we tested
   spectral-temporal metrics derived from intra-annual Landsat time series
   to distinguish between grass-dominated and woody pastures. The abundance
   of woody vegetation on pastures is an indicator for management
   intensity, since the duration and intensity of land use steer secondary
   succession rates, apart from climate and soil conditions. We used the
   developed Landsat-based metrics to analyze pasture intensity
   trajectories between 1985 and 2012 in Novo Progresso, Brazil, finding
   that woody vegetation cover generally decreased after four to ten years
   of grazing activity. Pastures established in the 80s and early 90s
   showed a higher fraction of woody vegetation during their initial land
   use history than pastures established in the early 2000s. Historic
   intensity trajectories suggested a trend towards more intensive land use
   in the last decade, which aligns well with regional environmental
   policies and market dynamics. This study demonstrates the potential of
   dense Landsat time series to monitor land-use intensification on
   Amazonian pastures. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {To investigate how plant-pollinator ecological interactions are affected
   by habitat modification, and to provide information to support
   restoration efforts, we characterized trophic interaction networks
   between bees and plants in a natural regeneration area and forest edge
   environments in a post-bauxite mining area in the eastern Amazon. For
   this purpose, bees were collected on the flowers of Gouania cornifolia
   Reissek (Rhamnaceae), an ordinary native liana in the studied areas,
   which plays a crucial role in post-mining regeneration by enhancing
   ecosystem interaction networks between plants and pollinators, and
   attracting a diversity of floral visitors. The pollen deposited on the
   bees' bodies was removed, and through palynology, the plant species that
   bees visited to collect food were identified. Subsequently, a
   presence-absence matrix was constructed, trophic interaction networks
   were created, and metrics analyses were performed. Forest edge areas
   showed greater native bee diversity, a higher richness of pollen types,
   and a more nested interaction network with the exclusion of the exotic
   species Apis mellifera compared to natural regeneration areas. Apis
   mellifera exploited a greater richness of floral sources due to its wide
   foraging range, which allowed for movement between different
   environments, including preserved forest, forest edge, and natural
   regeneration. This exotic bee alters the structure of interaction
   networks, being more evident in areas of natural regeneration. We found
   that bee-plant networks at forest edges demonstrated greater resilience
   compared to those in natural regeneration areas, emphasizing the
   importance of preserved forest environments in the recovery of
   ecological networks.},

Title = {Seeing the woods through the saplings: Using wood density to assess the
   recovery of human-modified Amazonian forests},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {106},
Number = {6},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {1. Most of the world's remaining tropical forests have been affected by
   either selective logging, understorey fires, fragmentation or are
   regrowing in areas that were previously deforested. Despite the ubiquity
   of these human-modified forests, we have a limited knowledge of their
   potential to recover key traits linked to ecosystem processes and
   consequent services.
   2. Here we present data from 31,095 trees and saplings distributed
   across 121 plots of undisturbed and disturbed primary forests as well as
   secondary forests in the eastern Amazon. We examined the
   post-disturbance recovery trajectory of an important plant functional
   trait, wood density. We tested whether human-modified Amazonian forests
   are experiencing a rapid or a slow, or even impeded, recovery of this
   trait, which is associated with the provision of a fundamental ecosystem
   service-carbon storage.
   3. As expected, we found that the plot-level wood density of trees and
   saplings in disturbed primary and secondary forests was significantly
   lower than in undisturbed forests. However, there was no significant
   difference in the average wood density of saplings between disturbed
   primary and secondary forests, possibly indicating a process of
   secondarization. We also found evidence that the recovery of wood
   density in human-modified forests is being severely disrupted due to
   edge effects (in the case of disturbed primary forests) and high liana
   densities (in the case of both disturbed primary and secondary forests).
   Surprisingly, these two factors were more important predictors of wood
   density recovery than the time elapsed since the disturbance event.
   4. Synthesis. Plant communities in human-modified Amazonian forests
   appear to not be recovering a key functional property-wood density,
   which in turn may affect their ability to store carbon in the future. If
   the aim of conservation programs in tropical forests is to maintain
   existing rates of ecosystem functions, processes and services, then they
   must concentrate efforts on avoiding anthropogenic disturbance in areas
   of currently undisturbed forests. It is also vital to prevent further
   disturbance in human-modified forests to avoid disrupting even more
   their recovery.},

Pages = {337-354},
Abstract = {Data for trace gas fluxes (NOx, N2O, and CH4) from the Amazon and
   cerrado region are presented with focus on the processes of production
   and consumption of these trace gases in soils and how they may be
   changed because of land use changes in both regions. Fluxes are
   controlled by seasonality, soil moisture, soil texture, topography, and
   fine-root dynamics. Compared to Amazonian forests where the rapid
   cycling of nitrogen supports large emissions of N2O, nitrification rates
   and soil emissions of N oxide gases in the cerrado region are very low.
   Several studies report CH4 consumption during both wet and dry seasons
   in forest soils, but there is occasionally net production of CH4 during
   the wet season. A few studies suggest an unknown source of CH4 from
   upland forests. As with N oxide emissions, there are few data on CH4
   emissions from cerrado soils, but CH4 consumption occurs during both wet
   and dry seasons. Clearing natural vegetation, burning, fertilization of
   agricultural lands, intensive cattle ranching, and increasing dominance
   by legume species in areas under secondary succession after land
   conversion have all been identified as causes of increasing N2O and NO
   emissions from tropical regions. Large uncertainties remain for regional
   estimates of trace gas fluxes. Improvement of models for the N oxides
   and CH4 fluxes for Amazonia and the cerrado still depends upon gathering
   more data from sites more widely distributed across two vast biomes and
   more importantly on basic theory about the controls of emissions from
   the ecosystem to the atmosphere.},

   abilities and species composition of these yeast communities differed
   from those of other forest-inhabiting Drosophila. The narrow feeding
   niches of the fasciola subgroup suggested the use of only part of the
   substrates available to the flies as food in the forest environment, as
   noted previously for cactophilic Drosophila serido (mulleri subgroup of
   the repleta group) in a sand dune ecosystem. The cactophilic yeasts that
   were isolated have not been previously found in forests. The fasciola
   subgroup probably used epiphytic cactus substrates as breeding and
   feeding sites in the forest. The physiological profile of yeasts
   associated with the fasciola flies was broader than that of yeasts
   associated with the cactophilic Drosophila serido, suggesting that the

   an active logging concession, and conducted growth studies of
   shihuahuaco trees planted in two mixed-species agroforestry fields, over
   a period of 3 years. We found that the majority of landholders were
   managing the natural regeneration of valuable hardwood timber trees, and
   planting seedlings on their lands. Growth of shihuahuaco trees in
   agroforestry fields was comparable to growth rates in managed
   silvicultural plantations, which suggests the potential for local
   smallholders activities to contribute to conservation of genetic stock
   and eventual renewal of populations depleted by logging. We recommend
   greater recognition and inclusion of local people, with their innovative

Abstract = {In recent decades, ecosystem theory has revisited the meaning of human
   action. There is a growing tendency to recognize that, once ``left
   alone{''}, human modified ecosystems do not return to their primitive
   state. Recently, this notion has been radically advocated by a group of
   ecologists who propose the concept of ``emerging{''} or ``novel{''}
   ecosystems. Emerging ecosystems are the direct result of either intense
   human modification of preserved ecosystems or the abandonment of
   established land uses (crops, pastures, planted forests etc.). These
   ecosystems present locally unprecedented patterns of species composition
   and dominance that don't depend on human intervention for its
   maintenance. Therefore these novel ecosystems ``exist as a
   non-regressive consequence of human activity{''}.
   In addressing the current manifestations of novel ecosystems, we adopt
   the retrospective method of historical geography, taking the landscape
   not only as a means but also as an end; more than mere instrument of
   knowledge, it is the object of knowledge. In this case, we visit the
   past only to fetch the explanatory elements of the present. Adopting
   this strategy, we proceed in the same way that natural scientists
   working in the evolutionary field (geologists, paleontologists, etc.):
   performing a ``remote sensing of processes through surviving
   structures{''}. More specifically, we use present residual structures
   (e.g. novel ecosystems) to reconstruct the past processes of landscape
   transformation. In this article, we aim to reconstruct the processes
   that produced two of the largest urban forests of today's world, both
   located in granite-gneiss massifs of Rio de Janeiro city, southeastern
   Brazil: Tijuca Massif and Pedra Branca Massif, both comprising,
   respectively, a National Park and a State Park.
   Currently, these two forest areas have particular ecological
   characteristics. Hiking on the slopes of Tijuca, it is easy to find
   whole tracts dominated by the exotic jackfruit (Artocarpus heterophyllus
   Lam.), which had been originally introduced in those slopes in the
   mid-nineteenth century, when a reforestation project began to reclaim
   the lands degraded by coffee plantation and timber extraction. More
   hardly noticeable are the small plateaus of blackened soil, evidence of
   an ancient industry, essential to the past urban economy: charcoal
   manufacture. The residues of this activity, however, are much more
   common in the west, in Pedra Branca. There, one of the authors has
   discovered, through archaeological work, over a thousand old charcoal
   kilns with a local influence in species composition and dominance. To
   notice the conspicuous presence of the banana (Musa paradisiaca L.),
   however, one needs no digging. Planted decades ago in any place
   accessible by a mule - on the backs of which the succulent and
   nutritious fruits traveled to less rugged terrain, where they were
   collected by trucks - many of these herbs-that-want-to-be-trees remain
   in the landscape after being abandoned by their growers, generating
   hybrid banana-forest systems.
   These are examples of how human societies as they spatialize themselves
   - a necessary condition of their existence in time -, leave behind the
   clues to their own historical intelligibility. However, this dynamic of
   social reproduction and understanding would never be possible if only
   humans were involved. Human beings and their societies emerge as such
   only in an open and dynamic relationship with what is non-human - other
   animals, plants, minerals etc., and their particular ways of being. In
   other words, these are more-than-human social regimes whose development
   is dependent on both human agency and earth systems. Thus, the emerging
   ecosystem approach constitutes a new way of ``reading{''} the landscape,
   one that weaves together the human and non-human worlds into a coherent
   environmental history of the present social-ecological system.},

   animals as seed removers of six native tree species, potentially
   mediated by the occurrence of fire. We sampled four previously burned
   sites and four unburned ones. Seed removal was assessed using two
   exclusion treatments: exclusive access of small rodents and access of
   all seed-removing vertebrates. The previous burning changed the
   structural characteristics of the forests, increasing the density of the
   understory vegetation and herbaceous cover, which determined differences
   in species composition, richness, and abundance of small rodents
   (abundance in the burned forests was 1/6 of the abundance in the unburnt
   ones). Seed removal rates across the six species were reduced in burnt
   forests in both treatments and were higher for the ``all vertebrates{''}
   treatment. Other vertebrates, larger than small rodents, played a
   significant role as seed removers for five of the six species. The
   effects of fire were consistent across species, but for the two species
   with the largest seeds (Hymenaea courbaril and Mauritia flexuosa)
   removal rates for both treatments were extremely low in the burned
   forests (<= 5\%). The observed decline in small rodent seed predation in
   the burned forests may have medium to long-term consequences on plant
   communities in gallery forests, potentially affecting community
   composition and species coexistence in these forests. Moreover, fire
   caused a sharp decline in seed removal by large mammals, indicating that
   the maintenance of dispersal services provided by these mammals (mainly
   the agouti Dasyprota azarae) for the large-seeded species may be
   jeopardized by the burning of gallery forests. This burning would also
   affect several small mammal species that occur in the surrounding
   typical savanna habitats but also use these forests. Fire events have
   been increasing in frequency and intensity because of human activities
   and climate changing. This current scenario poses a serious threat
   considering that these forests are fire-sensitive ecosystems within the
   Cerrado.},

Journal = {LAND USE POLICY},

Abstract = {Land occupation policies can have unintended consequences to the
   landscape structure, with pervasive effects on biodiversity. Here we
   investigate the long-term consequences of contrasting historical types
   of occupation in Amazonian landscapes (few large vs several small
   landowners) on forest fragmentation and landscape structure. Using
   satellite Landsat images series, we identified typologies of
   deforestation in the Amazon connected to large landowners (i.e.,
   Geometric pattern of deforestation) and small landowners (i.e., Fishbone
   pattern). Within those images, we selected seven landscapes (50 x 50 km)
   of each deforestation pattern and tracked the evolution of landscape
   spatial configuration through landscape metrics (forest fragments
   number, size, shape, and edge-core relation) from 1985 to 2015. Results
   showed that the amount of deforestation area was similar across time,
   irrespective of the deforestation patterns. However, in association with
   the Fishbone pattern, forest fragmentation resulted in numerous small
   forest fragments, with more intricate shape and forest patches
   containing two to three times more forest under edge effects when
   compared to the Geometric pattern. On the other hand, landscapes with
   Geometric patterns had larger deforestation patches, exposing the forest
   and the biodiversity to a less permeable or a low-quality matrix
   (usually pasture or soybean) and its known negative consequences. As a
   result, the threats to biodiversity should be different in each kind of
   landscape, despite both having the same levels of deforestation. The
   long-term consequences to the landscape structure will remain an
   untracked problem for forest conservation unless reforestation policies,
   tailored to the specificities of each typology of deforestation and
   forest remanent, are considered for the region.},

Abstract = {Deforestation and the disorderly exploitation of natural resources for
   agricultural expansion occurred at an accelerated pace in the Brejo
   microregion of the state of Paraiba, Brazil, which resulted in
   abandonment and erosion of the soil in a large part of the region. In
   view of this scenario, the present study was undertaken to investigate
   the soil respiration in systems involving different forms of land use
   and cover in caatinga enclaves moist forests (Brejo de Altitude areas).
   The study was conducted in four land use and cover systems, namely,
   pasture, mandala agriculture, agroforestry system, and forest. Microbial
   activity was estimated by quantifying the carbon dioxide (CO2) released
   in the soil respiration process, from the soil surface, and captured by
   KOH solution. Soil temperature (degrees C) and water content (\%) were
   monitored simultaneously with the analysis of soil respiration. The
   forms of land use and cover have a direct effect on the metabolic
   activity of soil organisms, and climatic factors such as soil
   temperature and moisture influence the dynamics of organic matter
   decomposition and, consequently, the release of CO2. The production of
   CO2 is higher at night than during the day, regardless of the analyzed
   systems. Among the evaluated areas, the forest showed the lowest CO2
   emissions, so it was considered a CO2 receptor in contrast to the
   pasture area, which functioned as a CO2 emitter. Management techniques
   that reduce surface temperature and increase organic matter should be
   prioritized to promote soil biota.},

Abstract = {The installation of shrimp and salt ponds has contributed to the
   devastation of several mangroves worldwide. In semiarid regions, where
   few mangroves are able to cope with the harsh environment, these forests
   are more vulnerable to human impacts. In Brazil, several aquaculture and
   salt ponds have been established over mangroves and salt flats
   ('apicuns') i.e. sandier natural areas contiguous to mangroves. These
   areas, often hypersaline, can be colonized by mangroves if tidal
   coverage increases, and should, therefore, be protected to ensure
   mangrove conservation against predicted sea level rise. To restore a
   mangrove stand in an abandoned saltworks (former `apicum' area) in
   northeast Brazil, hydrological restoration measures were applied, which
   involved digging channels to restore estuarine water flux to planted and
   water-borne propagules. In two years, mangroves developed rapidly in the
   intervention area, after decades of slow monospecific Avicennia
   germinans recovery. Survival of planted Rhizophora mangle propagules was
   high, and naturally established Avicennia germinans and Laguncularia
   racemosa reached far higher densities and heights in channels with
   respect to the condition before channeling. These results provide
   valuated insight into mangrove expansion over salt flats by increasing
   tidal coverage from ongoing rising sea levels. Associated with
   ecological changes after mangrove rehabilitation and driven by the
   return of plant and faunal key groups, ecological interactions like
   facilitation, herbivory and bioturbation increased in the restored area.
   Our results shed light on the processes related to forest recovery of
   degraded littoral areas, and contribute to improving the restoration and
   management of mangrove forests in semiarid coasts.},

   residues and removal of stem from soil. It was determined: floristic
   composition, species richness, diversity, density of stems, absolute

   The diversity (J `) was compared by Tukey's test (P < 0,05). The species
   richness presented conditions similar to those at the time of the
   installation of the experiment. The greater abundance of some species
   contributed to the reduction of diversity measured by the Shannon-Weaver

   systems varied according to the area, with tendency to reduce of rate
   the growth in both. The regeneration time (27 years) was not sufficient

Abstract = {Moist tropical forests in Amazonia and elsewhere are subjected to
   increasingly severe drought episodes through the El Nino-Southern
   Oscillation (ENSO) and possibly through deforestation-driven reductions
   in rainfall. The effects of this trend on tropical forest canopy
   dynamics, emissions of greenhouse gases, and other ecological functions
   are potentially large but poorly understood. We established a
   throughfall exclusion experiment in an east-central Amazon forest
   (Tapajos National Forest, Brazil) to help understand these effects.
   After 1-year intercalibration period of two 1-ha forest plots, we
   installed plastic panels and wooden gutters in the understory of one of
   the plots, thereby excluding similar to890 mm of throughfall during the
   exclusion period of 2000 (late January to early August) and similar
   to680 mm thus far in the exclusion period of 2001 (early January to late
   May). Average daily throughfall reaching the soil during the exclusion
   period in 2000 was 4.9 and 8.3 mm in the treatment and control plots and
   was 4.8 and 8.1 mm in 2001, respectively. During the first exclusion
   period, surface soil water content (0-2 m) declined by similar to100 mm,
   while deep soil water (2-11 m) was unaffected. During the second
   exclusion period, which began shortly after the dry season when soil
   water content was low, surface and deep soil water content declined by
   similar to140 and 160 mm, respectively. Although this depletion of soil
   water provoked no detectable increase in leaf drought stress (i.e., no
   reduction in predawn leaf water potential), photosynthetic capacity
   declined for some species, the canopy thinned (greater canopy openness
   and lower leaf area index) during the second exclusion period, stem
   radial growth of trees <15 m tall declined, and fine litterfall declined
   in the treatment plot, as did tree fruiting. Aboveground net primary
   productivity (NPP) (stemwood increment and fine litter production)
   declined by one fourth, from 15.1 to 11.4 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1), in the
   treatment plot and decreased slightly, from 11.9 to 11.5 Mg ha(-1)
   yr(-1), in the control plot. Stem respiration varied seasonally and was
   correlated with stem radial growth but showed no treatment response. The
   fastest response to the throughfall exclusion, and the surface soil
   moisture deficits that it provoked, was found in the soil itself. The
   treatment reduced N2O emissions and increased CH4 consumption relative
   to the control plot, presumably in response to the improved soil
   aeration that is associated with soil drying. Our hypothesis that NO
   emissions would increase following exclusion was not supported. The
   conductivity and alkalinity of water percolating through the litter
   layer and through the mineral soil to a depth of 200 cm was higher in
   the treatment plot, perhaps because of the lower volume of water that
   was moving through these soil layers in this plot. Decomposition of the
   litter showed no difference between plots. In sum, the small soil water
   reductions provoked during the first 2 years of partial throughfall
   exclusion were sufficient to lower aboveground NPP, including the
   stemwood increment that determines the amount of carbon stored in the
   forest. These results suggest that the net accumulation of carbon in
   mature Amazon forests indicated by recent permanent plot and eddy
   covariance studies may be very sensitive to small reductions in
   rainfall. The soil water reductions were also sufficient to increase
   soil emissions of N2O and to increase soil consumption of CH4-both
   radiatively important gases in the atmosphere.
   The possible reduction of tree reproductive activity points to
   potentially important effects of drought on the long-term species
   composition of Amazon forests.},

Abstract = {Across the tropics, vast deforested areas are undergoing forest
   regeneration due to land abandonment. Although secondary forest is an
   expanding type of landscape matrix that has been shown to buffer some of
   the negative consequences of forest loss and fragmentation on taxonomic
   diversity, little is known in this regard about the functional dimension
   of biodiversity. We took advantage of an ecosystem-wide fragmentation
   experiment to investigate longer term changes in functional diversity of
   a mega-diverse Amazonian bat assemblage associated with regrowth
   development in the matrix. We found that matrix regeneration affected
   several facets of bat functional diversity in secondary forest over
   time, increasing functional alpha diversity, species- and
   community-level functional uniqueness, altering functional trait
   composition, and resulting in functional beta-diversity changes via
   trait gains. However, approximately 30 years of matrix regeneration were
   insufficient for functional diversity to recover to the same levels as
   in continuous forest. Our results suggest that a combination of natural,
   humanassisted, and active restoration is likely to be the most
   successful strategy for restoring functional biodiversity of bats in
   human-modified tropical landscapes, a finding that most likely also
   applies to many other taxa.},

Abstract = {Luehea divaricata Mart. \& Zucc. of the Malvaceae family, is a forest
   tree species that has suffered great anthropic disturbance during the
   last decades. This fact has contributed to the reduction of natural
   populations and, consequently, of its genetic variability. This
   justifies studies related to the propagation of the species. As a means
   of vegetative propagation, micropropagation is an alternative for the
   regeneration of plants with difficult natural regeneration and a
   strategy for species conservation. The objectives of this study were to
   determine the most efficient type of explant and growth medium for in
   vitro establishment and verify the influence of different concentrations
   of BAP cytokinin in the multiplication of nodal segments of Luehea
   divaricata. The seeds used were collected and stored by the Fundacao
   Estadual de Pesquisa Agropecuaria - FEPAGRO/Florestas (Agriculture and
   Cattle Research State Foundation - FEPAGRO/Forests), in Santa Maria, RS,
   Brazil, and the seedlings obtained in vitro were used as sources of the
   explants. In the selection of the explants and growth medium, the shoot
   apical and nodal segments grown in the MS and WMP nutritive media were
   tested. Different concentrations of BAP (0, 5, 10 and 15 mg L(-1)) were
   evaluated in the in vitro multiplication of the species. In the in vitro
   establishment of Luehea divaricata, both shoot apical and nodal segments
   can be used and also both growth media. To maximize the growth of the
   species, the WPM growth medium should be used due to its reduced cost.
   In the in vitro multiplication of the species, cytokinin BAP should not
   be added because, besides reducing the costs in the in vitro cultivation
   of Luehea divaricata, the best response for the majority of the
   characteristics evaluated was observed in the absence of this
   regulator,.},

Abstract = {Data on carbon and biomass budgets under different land use in tropical
   savannas and some dry forests are reviewed. Global data show wide ranges
   of biomass carbon stocks (20-150 Mg C ha(-1)), net primary production
   (2-15 Mg C ha(-1)y(-1)) and litter production (2-10 Mg C ha(-1)y(-1))
   for the semiarid tropics. Although ranges for soil carbon are also wide,
   an average figure for the top 20 cm is probably 10 g C kg(-1), or about
   25 Mg C ha(-1). In order to arrive at a better understanding of C
   budgets and their controls, two regional reviews are presented for NE
   Brazil and W. Africa.
   In NE Brazil approximately 40\% of the lands have ``near-climax{''}
   native vegetation. Less than 10\% of the area is planted annually, but
   about 3-4 times that area is affected by shifting cultivation which has
   an average cycle of 5 y arable use followed by 20 y or more recovery.
   Standing biomass of native caatinga shows nearly the full global range
   with 2-50 Mg C ha(-1), Litter fall around 1-2 Mg C ha(-1)y(-1) is partly
   decomposed and partly consumed by animals, resulting in low average soil
   C levels near 8 g kg(-1), or 20 Mg C ha(-1). Under cultivation, C
   sequestration is decreased, and soils lose approximately half their C
   stocks before being abandoned.
   In W. Africa between 50-70\% of the land is under a management regime
   with minimal C returns to the soils. Overgrazing and over-exploitation
   for fuel wood has resulted in land degradation. Short fallow periods on
   cultivated lands have caused serious declines in soil C stocks. Both C
   sequestration and stocks are therefore lower in W. Africa than in NE
   Brazil.
   Improvements in the C sequestration in these semi arid regions depend on
   an increase in crop production under suitable rotations, improved fallow
   and animal husbandry, and a limitation on biomnass burning. Use of
   fertilizer is required for improved productivities but socioeconomic
   constraints largely prevent such improvements, resulting in a very
   limited scope for changes in soil C management.},

Abstract = {The seed rain (SR) is characterized by the arrival of propagules to the
   soil, caused by dispersion mechanisms and is essential to the natural
   regeneration dynamics of forests. The objective was to evaluate SR as an
   indicator of three restoration areas in the municipalities of Mato
   Grosso do Sul state, Ivinhema 12 years (IV-12), Jatef 13 years (JA-13) e
   Caarapo 16 years of planting (CA-16). Fifteen 0.64 m(2) collectors were
   randomly installed in each area and the material collected monthly from
   May 2015 to January 2016. The Shannon index (H') and Pielou Equability
   (J') were calculated and the seeds classified as dispersion syndrome,
   habit and successional class of tree species seeds. A total of 47,124
   propagules were identified. For CA-16, 27.033 seeds, 29 families, 39
   genera and 41 species were sampled. The JA-13 obtained 8,056 seeds, 22
   families, 32 genera and 33 species. The area IV-12 resulted in 12,035
   seeds, 13 families, 21 genera and 22 species. From the 61 species found,
   88.5\% are arboreal. Referring to the dispersion syndrome, most are
   zoochoric, with emphasis on IV-12 with 93.7\%, being 40.9\%
   allochthonous and from animals. Concerning to the successional class,
   the pioneers were prominent, mainly for the IV-12 (91.7\%). The SR can
   be considered a good indicator for assessing the environmental integrity
   of areas in restoration by providing subsidies for understanding the
   maintenance of ecological processes, since in the evaluated areas, most
   of the seeds were zoochoric species, with expressive contribution of
   allochthonous species, demonstrating the existence of a dispersal fauna
   facilitating the forest succession.},

Title = {Ecological restoration in Brazilian biomes: Identifying advances and
   gaps},
Journal = {FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {458},
Month = {FEB 15},
Abstract = {The Bonn challenge aims at the restoration of 350 million hectares of
   degraded ladscapes by 2030. In Brazil, the restoration goal for 2030 is
   12 million hectares. Despite the great demand for ecological restoration
   across the whole of Brazil, there have been no analyses of the studies
   carried out in different biomes. In addition, conservation efforts must
   cover all biomes, so that different regions can take advantage of the
   many benefits of restoration. Our aim was to identify advances and gaps
   in current restoration knowledge in order to guide future efforts in
   Brazil. Our bibliometric survey in the Web of Science using 23 keywords
   related to restoration generated a total of 530 papers, of which 291
   were included in the analysis. The papers were published in 121
   scientific journals between 1988 and 2018, with the largest number of
   papers in 2016. The Atlantic Forest was the biome with the highest
   number of studies, as it is one of the most threatened tropical forest
   regions in the world and maintains the largest number of research
   institutions and receives the highest level of funding support in the
   country. Regarding the types of studies, temporal monitoring was more
   frequent in the Amazon, Cerrado, Castings, and Pampa, while the
   monitoring at one point in time was more frequent in the Atlantic
   Forest. From the studies examined, 31\% used a reference area for
   comparing restoration success. The most studied organisms were plants
   (81\%), and among them, trees were the most frequent, followed by fungi,
   birds, invertebrates, mammals, and reptiles. The pre-restoration
   degradation differed among biomes, with deforestation for logging the
   most cited in the Amazon, agriculture, and livestock in the Atlantic
   Forest and Cerrado, logging and cattle ranching in Caatinga, and
   livestock in the Pampa and Pantanal. In general, active/assisted natural
   succession was the most frequent restoration process: planting seedlings
   more readily occurred in the Amazon, Atlantic Forest, and Caatinga,
   whereas natural regeneration in the Cerrado and Pantanal and sowing in
   Pampa. The studies varied among the age of restoration ( > 1 to 67 years
   for active restoration and > 1 to 120 years for passive/unassisted
   natural succession), and the number of species planted (1 to 121
   species). We identified an important regional knowledge gap for the
   Pantanal, Caatinga, and Pampa, as well as the need to include reference
   areas, evaluate different restoration techniques (besides planting
   seedlings), and the inclusion of other taxa and life forms in
   biodiversity studies apart from trees. We also identified the need to
   expand research to assess landscape metrics, prioritization,
   legislation, and public policies.},

Title = {Habemus seeds but they are non-viable: The importance of assessing seed
   viability in seed rain},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {219},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Seed rain is critical for forest recovery, especially in abandoned lands
   that have been converted to agriculture. However, such a critical role
   depends on seed viability, which has been largely overlooked in most
   seed rain studies. We assessed the viability of seeds in the seed rain
   falling into 12 plots from a Brazilian tropical dry forest: six plots
   exposed to slash-and-burn agriculture ('burned plots' = 111 seeds from
   10 species) and six located in forest stands ('control plots' = 5267
   seeds from 23 species). Using the tetrazolium test, we found that only
   767 of 5378 seeds (14\%) from 16 species were viable, but surprisingly,
   seed viability was 2.2 times higher in burned plots than in control
   ones. This does not imply that forest regeneration through seed rain is
   more effective in burned plots, as very few seeds arrived at these
   plots. A functional analysis revealed that the higher seed viability in
   burned plots may be explained by the fact that these plots were
   dominated by relatively large, hard-coated (orthodox), and abiotically
   dispersed seeds, with some type of dormancy, as seeds with these
   functional trait attributes showed the highest viability. To accurately
   assess the importance of seed rain for forest regeneration we must
   consider seed viability, as it can be very low in some places,
   especially if dominated by species with relatively small,
   animal-dispersed and recalcitrant seeds lacking dormancy.},

Title = {Agricultural land reduction due to the compliance with the current
   Forest Code: a study case of sugarcane production in the State of Sao
   Paulo},
Journal = {BIOTA NEOTROPICA},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {10},

Month = {OCT-DEC},
Abstract = {One of the major reasons of the proposed changes of the Brazilian Forest
   Code is that its compliance would supposedly harm several agricultural
   sectors, although this reason has been weakly supported by data. The
   goal of this work was to evaluate the implication of the compliance with
   the Forest Code for reducing areas of sugarcane production in the State
   of sao Paulo, aiming to estimate the upper limit of potential losses
   that the application of the Forest Code could bring to the economic
   viability of important sectors of Brazilian agricultural production. We
   analyzed 23 projects of environmental planning carried out in 1,961
   landholdings of sugarcane mills from sac. Paulo State, which totalized
   533,097 ha (9.7\% of the cultivated area with sugarcane in the state).
   In these projects, we carried out an environmental zoning of Permanent
   Protected Areas (PPA), lands of agricultural production, and potential
   lands to constitute Legal Reserves. The results indicated that, on
   average, 10.4\% of the total area of each farm was classified as PPA,
   and that only 21.2\% of PPA area (2.2\% of the total area) were occupied
   by some kind of agricultural production. Sugarcane occupied, in average,
   12.1\% of the areas classified as PPA (1.2\% of the total area).
   Overall, 76.5\% of the total area of projects was occupied by sugarcane
   fields and the sum of potential areas for compliance with the Legal
   Reserve., which were constituted by forest remnants (5.0\% of total
   area), abandoned lands (2.3\% of total area), and lands with other uses
   (6.3\% of total area), would result in 13.6\% of the total area and
   consequently generate a deficit of 6.4\% of lands for the full
   compliance with the Legal Reserve (20\%). This deficit could even be
   compensated, by law, outside the landholding register in landscapes with
   lower agriculture suitability. Therefore, the diagnostics presented in
   this work for the sugarcane sector in the State of Sao Paulo indicates
   that compliance with the current Forest Code would not reduce
   agricultural production, which highlight that part of the arguments that
   are favorable for changes in the Forest Code need to be revisited in the
   light of concrete data and in a less speculative way.},

Abstract = {The objective of this study was to assess the potential and the
   alterations of the soil seed bank as a mechanism for the regeneration of
   tree species in disturbed forest fragments after Eucalyptus grandis
   harvest. Soil samples were collected in two periods, during the winter

   each environment, 20 samples of soil were collected, with 60 samples per
   period (winter and summer), this samples were distributed in trays and
   arranged in open air for germination analysis. A total of 2,002
   individuals were identified, belonging to 36 species and 17 families.
   The highest densities occurred during the summer, which also showed
   higher similarity between the environments. More species and diversity
   in relation to the ages of regeneration was observed during this period.
   Therefore, this study represents a contribution for further experiments

Title = {Invasive plant and honeybee alter native plant-pollinator network
   structure in dry forest},
Journal = {ANAIS DA ACADEMIA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIAS},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {97},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {Invasive species pose a critical threat to ecosystems, with far-reaching
   consequences. Invasive plants can directly interact with native
   pollinators, while wind-pollinated grasses indirectly alter
   plant-pollinator networks by reshaping the composition of plant and
   animal communities, diminishing ecosystem functioning. Here, we
   investigated the effect of invasive grass on pollinator richness, native
   plant visits, and the structure of plant-pollinator networks.
   Additionally, we explored the influence of non-native honeybees on these
   same variables in the Caatinga. Invasive grass negatively affected
   native pollinators and reduced visitation to native plants. The
   dominance of invasive grass leads to an increased niche overlap among
   native pollinators. Surprisingly, this did not affect the number of
   visits by non-native honeybees. However, the increased honeybee
   visitation negatively impacted native pollinator richness, causing a
   60\% decline. Our results underscore the compounded negative effects of
   invasive grass and non-native honeybees on native plant-pollinator
   dynamics. Invasive grasses indirectly decrease pollinator visits by
   altering plant communities. Meanwhile, honeybees, unaffected by invasive
   grass, decrease native pollinator species' richness and visitation
   rates. These findings emphasize the significant impact of biological
   invasions on ecosystem health, shedding light on the complex interplay
   between invasive species and plant-pollinator interactions in arid,
   abandoned landscapes.},

Abstract = {Variations in leaf morphometry and in diameter and height growth of
   plants may occur due to changes in light and temperature conditions of
   the forest in order to compensate the stress in the habitat. In this
   study, we examine the relationship of seedling and juvenile size and
   leaf area of woody species in forests of different ages ({[}55 and 19
   years) in northeastern Brazil. A total of 600 individuals of four
   species, seedlings and juveniles that survived a rainy season were
   evaluated. Seedlings and juveniles of Croton blanchetianus Baill,
   Poincianella pyramidalis (Tul.) L. P. Queiroz, Myracrodruon urundeuva
   Allemao and Commiphora leptophloeos (Mart.) J.B. Gillett were measured
   for height and stem diameter in the beginning of the rainy season of
   2014. One leaf of each individual was collected in the beginning of the
   rainy season. Leaves were photographed, and leaf area was measured.
   Differences in height, diameter and leaf area between forests and the
   existence of a relationship of diameter and height to leaf area were
   examined. Leaf area and seedling and juvenile size of C. blanchetianus
   and C. leptophloeos decreased as succession progressed. However, this
   was not observed for seedlings of P. pyramidalis and juveniles of M.
   urundeuva. Leaf area explained 7-26\% of the variation in size of
   individuals in the young forest and 11-39\% of the variation in size of
   individuals in the mature forest. Despite variations in leaf area,
   significant changes in growth rate were not found with the increase in
   forest age for most ontogenetic stages and species.},

Abstract = {Understanding local patterns of species-specific litterfall can help
   predict spatial differences in the amount and quality of organic matter
   input to systems under different environmental conditions. However,
   little is known about the drivers of differences in litterfall
   production in mangroves. Here we combined data from leaf litterfall (LL)
   studies (n = 13) and floristic studies (n = 16) conducted in the
   mangroves of the Ajuruteua peninsula (North of Brazil), at sites
   composed mainly of Rhizophora mangle and/or Avicennia germinans. We
   investigated the relationship between LL and vegetation parameters
   (height, diameter, basal area, density, and relative density) using
   partial least-squares regressions (PLS-R), building four models with
   different combinations of these parameters. Vegetation parameters
   explained 69-85\% of the annual LL of A. germinans and 50-66\% of R.
   mangle. Relatively strong, univariate significant relationships were
   also found between basal area and A. germinans LL (R-2 = 0.40), and
   between height and R. mangle LL (R-2 = 0.41). Nonetheless, models with
   four to five predictors yielded better fits. To illustrate the
   applicability of our approach we used the PLS-R models to calculate the
   LL of simulated sites. This simulation indicated a clear increase in LL
   production along the transition from Avicennia-to Rhizophora-dominated
   mangroves. As the leaf litter of these species differ substantially in
   chemical composition and decomposability, such transition in species
   composition will likely affect nutrient dynamics in the region. Thus, we
   suggest reporting species-specific site characteristics along with LL in
   future studies to obtain more robust models to predict future LL
   production at sites of changing vegetation structure.},

Abstract = {Cenostigma pyramidale, a pioneer species presents in all different

   regeneration areas of Caatinga after land used changed and abandonment
   was used to investigates the morphological and physiological attributes

   herbivories. Leaf samples were collected to evaluate the percentage of
   the herbivory and index of sclerophylly. Anatomy, histochemistry, total
   phenolic content, epicuticular wax load, and n-alkanes profile were also
   performed. The results showed an inverse relationship between the
   percentage of herbivory and the index of sclerophylly. The leaves showed
   typical morphological and anatomical characteristics of xeric
   environments plants such as uniseriate epidermis and trichomes.
   Furthermore, it was also noticed a decrease in the overall thickness and
   the tissues according to the advancement of the successional stages. The
   histochemical revealed the presence of lipidic substances coating the
   epidermal layers, phenolics compounds stored in secretory structures,
   and starch in the mesophyll. The concentration of phenolics compounds
   indicating the difference from health leaves of plants between different
   stages of regeneration, but no difference when they were herbivored. The
   amount of cuticle wax did not change significantly with the successional
   stage. The profile of n-alkanes was characterized by the predominance of
   nonacosane (C29) and hentriacontane (C31). The C29 content decreases
   with the advancement of the successional stage, while the C31 content
   increases. All those attributes have a role to protect the plants to
   acclimate to the various environmental conditions of Caatinga.},

Journal = {ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING},

Month = {FEB 15},
Abstract = {Mining contributes significantly to the world's economy. However, it
   brings strong environmental impacts, including the destruction of the
   original vegetation. In this way, the recovery of degraded areas by
   mining has been a mandatory procedure in many countries. With the
   objective to review this subject, a bibliometric analysis was carried
   out using scientific articles published in the period 1990-2018. A total
   of 700 articles in 171 journals were sampled. Ecological Engineering and
   Restoration Ecology were the journals with the largest number of
   articles. There was a significant increase of articles along time
   approaching the use of geotechnologies and arbuscular fungi. Recovered
   or recovering ecosystems were studied in 45 countries, mainly in Brazil,
   Australia, USA, China, and Spain. Coal and bauxite were the most common
   resources mined. The most frequent recovery methods were: seedling
   planting, direct seeding, natural regeneration, and hydroseeding, with
   techniques employed in some of them. In 35.71\% of the articles, a small
   number of species (2-5) were used for the initial plant's establishment.
   The number of articles decreased as the number of both, plant species
   used in the initial recovery phase, and ecosystem's age increased. In
   monitoring, the most important indicators were classified as functional
   or functional plus structural. From the functional indicators, the
   Technosols or rebuilt soils were the most evaluated. Future perspectives
   on forests recovery includes methods tailored to peculiar features (soil
   and economic) of each ecosystem. For the forest recovery monitoring, the
   use of geotechnologies, mainly the Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), as
   well as wildlife indicators tend to increase rapidly.},

Month = {SEP 15},
Abstract = {Paleoenvironmental reconstructions based on Amazonian fluvial and marine
   pollen data are often hindered due to the scarcity of modern calibration
   data. In Amazonia, rivers are the main pathways for pollen from upland
   and flooded forests to continental and marine sediment sinks. Linking
   pollen assemblages transported by rivers to watershed vegetation is
   crucial to interpret palynological archives. In order to constrain the
   interpretation of palynological archives, we analysed the pollen content
   of 36 riverbed sediment samples distributed from the mouth of the Ica
   River (ca. 68 degrees W) to the Amazon estuary (ca. 49 degrees W) with
   support of grain size and major element analyses of the inorganic
   sedimentary content. The palynological analysis shows a strong imprint
   of the lowland floodplain vegetation as the main source of the
   riverborne pollen. The upper reaches of the Amazon River present
   abundant Cecropia, reflecting early-successional stages induced by
   intense floodplain disturbance. The middle and lower reaches of the
   Amazon River exhibit a progressive increase in herbs mainly represented
   by Poaceae and Cyperaceae, related to wider floodplains covered by
   seasonally inundated vegetation. Floodplain forests of whitewater rivers
   (varzeas) are palynologically characterized by Iriartea, Mauritia, Ilex,
   Pseudobombax, Acalypha, and Luehea/Laetia, with high frequency of
   Cecropia or herbs, and montane taxa. At the black- and clearwater
   rivers, the igapo floodplain forests provide high percentages of
   Symmeria, Myrtaceae, and Alchornea, and can be distinguished by
   Sapium/Sebastiana, Piranhea, Amanoa, Pouteria, Ferdinandusa/Genipa,
   Attalea/Astrocatyum, and Eschweilera which suggest conditions of higher
   stability and mature forests. Contribution from the non-flooded uplands,
   Andean Mountains, and savannas/Cerrado occur, but their signals are
   blurred by the high pollen production of the lowland floodplains. Our
   data provide a calibration set for environmental reconstructions of
   river-influenced deposits across the Amazon including offshore areas of
   the most iconic riverine dominated landscape in the world.},

Abstract = {Proximity to forests contributes to the recolonisation of
   anthropogenic-disturbed areas through seed input. We evaluated the role
   of proximity to a mature forest in the recolonisation of an agricultural
   area that has been abandoned for 18 years and is currently a young
   forest. Seed rain was monitored at fixed distances from the mature
   forest. The type of surface recolonisation (germination versus
   resprouting) and the reproductive season were measured in both forests.
   The majority of plants recolonising the young forest originated from
   seed germination. Proximity to the mature forest contributed to the seed
   rain in the young forest; however, 18 years has not provided sufficient
   time for the recolonisation of 80 species present in the mature forest.
   Some species shared between forests differed in their fruiting season
   and seed dispersal. The seed rain had a total species richness of 56, a
   total density of 2270 seeds.m(-2). year(-1) and predominance of self-and
   wind dispersal. A significant reduction in seed rain with increasing
   distance from the mature forest was observed. The young forest contained
   35 species not observed in the mature forest, and the floristic
   similarity between the two forests was 0.5, indicating that the two
   forests are floristically distinct.},

Abstract = {Several ambitious restoration targets have been set for recovering
   degraded ecosystems in Brazil (21 million hectares with a legal deficit
   of native vegetation). The development of scientific knowledge and
   skilled professionals is necessary to meet this demand and is
   fundamental for achieving success in medium- and long-term restoration.
   In this study, we describe the availability and profile of postgraduate
   courses on ecological restoration in Brazil. We surveyed 272
   postgraduate programs, comprising six specific areas of concentration
   (forestry, soil sciences, botany, environmental engineering, ecology,
   and environmental science). We analyzed all selected courses in terms of
   location, approach (economic, social, and legal), and restoration
   techniques. Only 27\% of the postgraduate programs analyzed offer
   ecological restoration courses, and 49\% of these are offered in the
   southeast region of the country. Regions covered by nonforest
   ecosystems, such as Pampas, Caatinga, and Pantanal, were poorly
   represented. Legal aspects were considered in 51\% of the courses,
   whereas social and economic approaches were only considered in 2.7 and
   11\% of the courses, respectively. Seedling planting (85\%) and
   nucleation (68\%) were the most frequently cited techniques of active
   restoration, and passive restoration was mentioned in 63\% of the
   courses. Our findings highlight the need for increasing postgraduate
   courses in areas with nonforest ecosystems, especially due to a lack of
   knowledge about restoration of these areas. The incorporation of
   economic and social approaches is highly recommended, considering the
   importance of these attributes in achieving success in large-scale

Abstract = {Mutual interactions between frugivorous birds and plants in an urban
   fragment of Atlantic Forest, Salvador, BA. This study was developed
   between October 2009 and September 2010 in an urban fragment of Atlantic
   Florest, Parque Metropolitano de Pituacu (PMP), Salvador, BA. The
   objective was to identify potential dispersers of seeds, as well as
   species of plants that can have great importance in maintaining the
   community of birds that occur in this park. A further objective was to
   identify seasonal variations between mutual interactions. In order to
   register the interactions, a track of 2 km had been crossed on a weekly
   basis. When a feeding event was observed, the behavior used by the bird
   to remove and ingest the fruits was registered. Twenty-two species of
   birds were observed consuming fruits. However, one of them was
   considered a predator (Sporophila nigricollis), resulting in 17 species
   of birds present in the mutualism network. Twenty-seven species of
   plants had their fruits consumed. Of those, five species had their
   predated fruits or pulp consumed. Tangara palmarum was the most
   remarkable bird, consuming four times more fruits that any another and
   reaching the highest index of importance (Ij = 0.208). Among the species
   of plants, Miconia minutiflora (Melastomataceae) reached the greater
   index of importance (Ij = 0.246) and together with Didymopanax
   morototoni constituted 50.27\% of the interactions. The second highest
   index of importance was reached by Pera glabrata (Ij = 0.154). It was
   registered in spring, and the largest amount of fruit was consumed from
   that species. The results of this study reinforce the importance of
   activities carried out by small size generalist birds, particularly in
   seed dispersion within much altered forest fragments. This is
   fundamental in accelerating the mechanisms of natural regeneration.},

Abstract = {With 60\% of all primate species now threatened with extinction and many

   conservation action is urgently needed. But what type of action? Here we
   argue that restoration of primate habitat will be an essential component
   of strategies aimed at conserving primates and preventing the
   extinctions that may occur before the end of the century and propose
   that primates can act as flagship species for restoration efforts. To do
   this we gathered a team of academics from around the world with
   experience in restoration so that we could provide examples of why
   primate restoration ecology is needed, outline how primates can act as
   flagship species for restoration efforts of tropical forest, review what
   little is known about how primate populations respond to restoration
   efforts, and make specific recommendations of the next steps needed to
   make restoration of primate populations successful. We set four
   priorities: (1) academics must effectively communicate both the value of
   primates and the need for restoration; (2) more research is needed on
   how primates contribute to forest restoration; (3) more effort must be
   put into Masters and PhD level training for tropical country nationals;
   and finally (4) more emphasis is needed to monitor the responses of
   regenerating forest and primate populations where restoration efforts
   are initiated. We are optimistic that populations of many threatened
   species can recover, and extinctions can be prevented, but only if
   concerted large-scale efforts are made soon and if these efforts include
   primate habitat restoration.},

Title = {C And N Stocks And Soil Organic Matter Dynamics In Succession
   Agroforestry Systems In Brazil},
Journal = {ANAIS DA ACADEMIA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIAS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {96},
Number = {2},
Abstract = {Soil organic matter is closely linked to the quality of Agroecosystems
   and directly influences the agricultural production and the
   environmental conditions. Understanding of soil organic matter dynamics
   in agroforestry systems requires studies with a temporal focus, since
   the changes in its chemical composition tend to follow a gradual
   behavior. The aim of this study was to investigate the dynamics of
   changes in stocks and chemical composition of soil organic matter under
   agroforestry, using systems in different stages of vegetation
   succession. The soil sampling was carried out from trenches, and litter
   fractions were also sampled. The samples were collected from different
   layers of the soil profile under the following conditions: Control;
   agroforestry with 1 year; agroforestry with 3 years; agroforestry with 7
   years and Forest in natural regeneration. The following
   attributes/parameters were determined/calculated: i) C and N contents
   and stocks and C/N ratio; ii) C and N proportions in soil granulometric
   fractions and iii) kinetics of organic matter accumulation in soil with
   the time of systems evolution. The results showed: i) The C/N ratio
   tended to increase in depth but did not show a clear variation between
   the systems evaluated; ii) the adoption of successive agroforestry
   practices has the potential to increase the C and N stocks in soil; iii)
   the soil organic matter accumulation occurs gradually during the systems
   evolution and is mainly related to the particulate fraction (> 0.053
   mm).},

Title = {Advances and limitations of individual-based models to analyze and

Journal = {AQUATIC BOTANY},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {89},
Number = {2},
Pages = {260-274},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Mangrove ecosystems are considered vulnerable to climate change as
   coastal development limits the ecosystem services and adaptations
   important to their survival. Although they appear rather simple in terms
   of species diversity, their ecology is complex due to interacting
   geophysical forces of tides, surface runoff, river and groundwater
   discharge, waves, and constituents of sediment, nutrients and saltwater.
   These interactions limit developing a comprehensive framework for
   science-based sustainable management practices. A suite of models have
   been developed independently by various academic and government
   institutions worldwide to understand the dynamics of mangrove ecosystems
   and to provide ecological forecasting capabilities under different
   management scenarios and natural disturbance regimes. The models have
   progressed from statistical tables representing growth and yield to more
   sophisticated models describing various system components and processes.
   Among these models are three individual-based models (IBMs) (FORMAN,
   KIWI, and MANGRO). A comparison of models' designs reveal differences in
   the details of process description, particularly, regarding neighbor
   competition among trees. Each model has thus its specific range of
   applications. Whereas FORMAN and KIWI are most suitable to address
   mangrove forest dynamics of stands, MANGRO focuses on landscape dynamics
   on larger spatial scale. A comparison of the models and a comparison of
   the models with empirical knowledge further reveal the general needs for
   further field and validation studies to advance our ecological
   understanding and management of mangrove wetlands. (C) 2008 Elsevier

Abstract = {Twenty-one botanical stocks, of one hectare each, were inventoried, in
   the States of Para (17), Maranhao (3) and Rondonia (1).  In total,
   10,257 individuals were registered, with diameter at breast height (DBH)
   > or < 10 cm. belonging to 790 species, distributed among 68 families. 
   One hundred and eight species (14\% of the total) presented 20 or more
   individuals, totalizing 7,011 (68\%) individuals; these species are
   analyzed in the present paper in relation to:  1) growth in diameter and
   thickness of the trunk, 2) vertical stratification, 3) natural
   regeneration and 4) usefulness of the species.
   The individuals of each of the 108 species were grouped in 5 classes
   according to growth of the trunk, namely:  a) Small (DBH < 30 cm.) 45
   (42\%) species; b) Medium, between 30 and 70 cm. 43 (40\%) species; c) 5
   (5\%) species; d) very big DBH (between 100 and 200 cm.) 5 (4\%) species
   and e) Giant (DBH > 200 cm.) 2 (2\%) species.
   The vertical stratification, obeys the following criteria:  a) emerging
   (total height greater than 40 m.) 6 (6\%) species; b) Bunting (height
   between 25 and 40 m.), 54 (50\%) species and, c) sub forest (height less
   than 10m) 2 (2\%) species.
   Natural regeneration, analyzed with respect to the availability of
   light, allowed us to classify the 108 species studied in three distinct
   groups:  a) Full sunthey regenerate in open environments - total 43
   (40\%) species; b) wood clearing - need direct light for part of the
   day, 100 (93\%) species and shadow - regenerate only in the absence of
   direct light, 8 (7\%) species.
   The present usefulness of the species was approached under two large
   groups:  value of the wood and non-wood use(s).  The species with wood
   value were grouped under the following categories:  a) Very high value
   (m3 sawed wood:  greater than U.S. \$400.00) no species were registered
   in this category; b) High value, 16 species registered (15\%); c) medium
   value, 16 (15\%) species were registered and d) low value (m3 of sawed
   wood less than U.S. \$80.00) 38 (35\%) species.  Of the 108 species
   studied, 38 (35\%) had at present no value in the internal and external
   markets.  The non-wood uses are:  a) food for man and fauna, (10
   species); b) food exclusively for the fauna, (85 species); c) fiber
   providers, (13 species); d) medical application, (12 species); e)
   production of gum, latex or essential oil (8.8 and 9 species)
   respectively; f) cellulose industry, (5 species); g) ornamental use, (4
   species); h) trunk bark with anti-corrosive properties, (1 species);
   aromatic, (1 species); and silicose, (1 species); application with
   tincture (2 species); and venomous substance for cattle, (1 species).
   Finally, various comments are made on the most characteristic species of
   the humid dense Amazonian Forest.},

Abstract = {In order to understand the dynamics and growth processes of Araucaria
   angustifolia (Bert.) O. Ktze., this study evaluated the behavior of the
   following variables: number of trees, diameter, basal area. ha(-1) and
   volume.ha(-1) of this species over eight consecutive years by the
   measurement of permanent plots established in a remnant of Araucaria
   Forest, located in Cacador - SC, which presents large individuals of A.
   angustifolia and an understory occupied by bamboos. Therefore, two
   hypotheses were evaluated: i) growth and yield of the variables tend to
   remain stable or decrease over time and ii) recruitment of new
   individuals is low or nonexistent. The results show a reduction in the
   number of trees, in average basal area and stand volume per hectare due
   to mortality and absence of natural regeneration. There was an average
   increase about 3 cm in diameter, ranging from 75.95 cm to 78.57 cm, and
   the mean periodical annual increment (PAI) of 0.33 cm.year(-1). The
   average basal area decreased by 4.80 m(2).ha(-1), ranging from 32.75
   m(2).ha(-1) to 27.95 m(2).ha(-1). Average volume per hectare decreased
   by 78.38 m(3).ha(-1) with a negative PAI of 9.8 m(3).ha(-1).year(-1).
   Statistically significant differences were noted mainly in response to
   weather events that have raised the rate of mortality in the third and

Journal = {JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {34},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Mangroves cover an estimated area of approximately 12 to 20 million ha
   worldwide and serve as protection for the coastline from erosion and
   flooding. Nearly 70 mangrove species are considered endangered and could
   disappear in the next decade, which would have devastating economic and
   environmental consequences for coastal communities because of their
   ecological and economic importance. The annual rate of disappearance of
   coastal ecosystems is four times greater than the rate of the
   disappearance of rain forests. Mangroves suffer great pressure from the
   rapid conversion of forests into agricultural and urban areas, and, in
   these scenarios, climate change promotes specific pressures on mangroves
   and may increase the effects of anthropogenic activities. The focus of
   this study was to map the changes in mangrove areas in six river
   estuaries in Ceara, northeastern Brazil, between the years 1992 and 2011
   and identify the main drivers of these changes. The results showed an
   increase in mangrove areas of five estuaries, while one estuary showed a
   decrease in mangrove area. Changes in river output capacity and sediment
   accumulation in the estuaries were associated with dam construction in
   the watersheds and can be responsible for new upstream mangrove areas in
   newly formed islands and along river banks. Abandoned saltpans also
   contributed to expansion of the mangrove areas. Deforestation for the
   construction of shrimp farms was the main cause of decreases in mangrove
   area, especially in the Pirangi estuary.},

Journal = {GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {26},
Number = {10},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Tropical forests absorb large amounts of atmospheric CO(2)through
   photosynthesis, but high surface temperatures suppress this absorption
   while promoting isoprene emissions. While mechanistic isoprene emission
   models predict a tight coupling to photosynthetic electron transport
   (ETR) as a function of temperature, direct field observations of this
   phenomenon are lacking in the tropics and are necessary to assess the
   impact of a warming climate on global isoprene emissions. Here we
   demonstrate that in the early successional speciesVismia guianensisin
   the central Amazon, ETR rates increased with temperature in concert with
   isoprene emissions, even as stomatal conductance (g(s)) and net
   photosynthetic carbon fixation (P-n) declined. We observed the highest
   temperatures of continually increasing isoprene emissions yet reported
   (50 degrees C). WhileP(n)showed an optimum value of 32.6 +/- 0.4 degrees
   C, isoprene emissions, ETR, and the oxidation state of PSII reaction
   centers (q(L)) increased with leaf temperature with strong linear
   correlations for ETR ( = 0.98) and q(L)( = 0.99) with leaf isoprene
   emissions. In contrast, other photoprotective mechanisms, such as
   non-photochemical quenching, were not activated at elevated
   temperatures. Inhibition of isoprenoid biosynthesis repressedP(n)at high
   temperatures through a mechanism that was independent of stomatal
   closure. While extreme warming will decreaseg(s)andP(n)in tropical
   species, our observations support a thermal tolerance mechanism where
   the maintenance of high photosynthetic capacity under extreme warming is
   assisted by the simultaneous stimulation of ETR and metabolic pathways
   that consume the direct products of ETR including photorespiration and
   the biosynthesis of thermoprotective isoprenoids. Our results confirm
   that models which link isoprene emissions to the rate of ETR hold true
   in tropical species and provide necessary ``ground-truthing{''} for
   simulations of the large predicted increases in tropical isoprene
   emissions with climate warming.},

Abstract = {Many tropical landscapes are today characterized by small forest patches
   embedded in an agricultural mosaic matrix. In such highly fragmented
   landscapes, agroforests have already been recognized as refuges for
   biodiversity but few studies have investigated the potential of
   non-forested land-use types to contribute to overall biodiversity of
   functionally important taxa in the tropics. This study experimentally
   investigated species richness, abundance, and community similarity of
   arthropods on Yellow Passion fruit plants, planted in standardized
   patches in 30 sites along a land-use intensity gradient. The gradient
   comprised all major land-use types of the area: forest fragments,
   abandoned coffee agroforests, coffee agroforests managed under shade
   trees, pastures, and rice fields in Coastal Ecuador. We found a total of
   2123 individuals belonging to 242 species. Overall arthropod species
   richness increased with light intensity and leaf-surface area and
   decreased with land-use intensity: forest fragments and abandoned coffee
   agroforests harboured significantly more species than rice or pastures.
   Overall diversity in managed coffee agroforests was intermediate between
   the intensively managed and more natural habitats. However, the three
   most abundant taxa of arthropods (ants, spiders, and beetles) had the
   highest number of species in managed coffee agroforests, while ant
   abundance was highest in abandoned coffee agroforests and spider
   abundance highest in managed coffee agroforests. Analyses of community
   similarity revealed that open (pasture, and rice) and shaded (forest,
   abandoned and managed coffee agroforests) land-use types had distinct
   arthropod communities. In conclusion, although open agricultural
   land-use types tend to have fewer species in lower numbers, all land-use
   types contribute to overall biodiversity of the agricultural matrix
   because of distinct communities in shaded vs. non-shaded land-use types.

Title = {Interactive effects between vegetation structure and soil fertility on
   tropical ground-dwelling arthropod assemblages},
Journal = {APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {155},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The development of forests undergoing restoration determines the
   structure of the vegetation, influencing ground-dwelling arthropod
   composition. Soil fertility can interact with vegetation structure,
   influencing the diversity and composition of arthropod assemblages
   through bottom-up effects on developing forests. We evaluated if soil
   fertility (here defined by the attributes directly related to
   macronutrient availability) and the vegetation structure in three
   adjacent areas from different land-use/cover categories (abandoned
   pasture, riparian forest undergoing restoration, and remnant riparian
   forest) influences ground-dwelling arthropod assemblages. These areas
   were subject to a gradient of soil fertility due to the presence of a
   corral that resulted in a local increase of soil nutrients in the three
   areas, enabling to evaluate the interaction between soil fertility and
   vegetation structure. We hypothesized that ground-dwelling arthropod
   assemblages have lower diversity in pasture, intermediate in forest
   undergoing restoration and higher diversity in the remnant forest.
   Furthermore, we expected that increasing soil fertility would have a
   positive effect in these assemblages through bottom-up effects.
   Environmental conditions were characterized by vegetation structure and
   soil chemical attributes variables, whereas arthropods were sampled with
   pitfalls and identified to morphospecies. Diversity indicators responded
   differentially to the studied effects. Abundances decreased with soil
   fertility, and were higher in the forest undergoing restoration,
   followed by pasture and remnant forest. Species richness also varied
   among categories, following the same pattern as abundances. On the other
   hand, diversity indices indicated an interaction between soil fertility
   and land use category, with larger effects of soil fertility on
   diversity in the more simplified habitats (pasture and forest undergoing
   restoration), whereas no bottom-up effects were recorded in the remnant
   forest; species evenness increased with soil fertility in all studied
   areas. A redundancy analysis (RDA) indicated that both vegetation
   structure and soil attributes significantly influenced arthropod
   composition. Arthropod assemblages in areas undergoing restoration with
   higher soil fertility and low grass cover were more similar to
   assemblages in remnant forest when compared to areas with low soil
   fertility, independently of the vegetation structure, indicating an
   interaction between these two effects. Therefore, ground-dwelling
   arthropod assemblages responded both to increasing vegetation complexity
   resulting from the different land use/cover categories, and to
   increasing soil fertility, so that they are effective indicators to
   evaluate the recovery of ecosystems in forest restoration projects and
   to determine the importance of soil fertility in this process.},

Abstract = {The identification of the main sources of anthropic greenhouse gas
   emissions (GHG) associated with the mitigation and removal of these
   emissions has become an important instrument in the attenuation of the
   climatic changes predicted by the IPCC. The largest emission source in
   Brazil is forest conversion. This land use change has always had a
   strong relationship with the expansion of agriculture, an activity of
   great importance in the country, which has the largest commercial cattle
   herd in the planet. Following the considerable reduction in emissions
   from deforestation, agriculture has been since 2010 the most important
   source (MCTI (Ministerio da Ciencia, Tecnologia e Inovacao), 2013.
   Brasilia: Ministerio daCiencia, Tecnologia e Inovacao, Brasil). Seeking
   to discover the possibilities of altering the emissions profile in the
   agricultural sector, four scenarios were developed related to how this
   is dealt with in the beef cattle sector, calculating the potential
   removal of carbon from the atmosphere through natural regeneration of
   biomes. The results suggest that picketing and rotation scenario has the
   greatest potential, with a carbon reduction of 17.7 Gt CO(2)eq, while
   the shared raising with grain legumes scenario has the lowest calculated
   reduction potential of 7.1 Gt CO(2)eq was calculated. The animal
   confinement scenario had an intermediary reduction potential of 8.3 Gt
   CO(2)eq. The mosaic of methods scenario, in which it is attempted to
   simulate the parallel adoption of the measures proposed in all other
   scenarios, had a reduction potential of 13.1 Gt CO(2)eq. In the
   scenarios where animal confinement occurs, the treatment of waste with
   biodigestion allows the generation of biogas and biofertilizers,
   contributing to an increase in the potential carbon reduction. (C) 2014

Abstract = {Positive interactions in plant communities are under-reported in
   subtropical systems most likely because they are not identified as
   stressful environments. However, environmental factors or disturbance
   can limit plant growth in any system and lead to stressful conditions.
   For instance, salinity and low nutrient and water availability generate
   a gradient of stressful conditions in coastal systems depending on
   distance to shore. In a tropical coastal system in SE Brazil, we aimed
   to assess whether Guapira opposita, a shrub common in restinga
   environments, acted as nurse involved in ecological succession and which
   factors influenced its facilitation process. We sampled perennial
   species above 10 cm in height under the canopy of 35 G. opposita
   individuals and in neighbouring open areas. Shrub height, canopy area
   and distance to freshwater bodies were measured in the field, and
   distance to the ocean was obtained from aerial images. In addition, we
   measured the distance to the closest forest patch as a potential source
   of seeds. Plant abundance and species richness were higher under the
   canopy of G. opposita than in open areas. Facilitation by G. opposita
   was mainly determined by shrub height, which had a positive relationship
   with woody and bromeliads abundance and species richness while there was
   no relationship with the other factors. Overall, our data evidence that
   tropical environments may be highly stressful for plants and that nurse
   species play a key role in the regeneration of restinga environments,
   where their presence is critical to maintain ecosystem diversity and

   and 6.1 to 9.0 cm). We obtained 25.151 seeds m(-2), distributed between
   85 species. The predominant life form was herbaceous (98\%), with the
   Cyperaceae family being the most abundant. In the seed banks of the
   three areas, only a few seeds from a restricted number of woody species

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {47},

Abstract = {We developed a method to reconstruct land use history from Landsat
   images time-series. The method uses a breakpoint detection framework
   derived from the econometrics field and applicable to time-series
   regression models. The Breaks For Additive Season and Trend (BFAST)
   framework is used for defining the time-series regression models which
   may contain trend and phenology, hence appropriately modelling
   vegetation intra and inter-annual dynamics. All available Landsat data
   are used for a selected study area, and the time-series are partitioned
   into segments delimited by breakpoints. Segments can be associated to
   land use regimes, while the breakpoints then correspond to shifts in
   land use regimes. In order to further characterize these shifts, we
   classified the unlabelled breakpoints returned by the algorithm into
   their corresponding processes. We used a Random Forest classifier,
   trained from a set of visually interpreted time-series profiles to infer
   the processes and assign labels to the breakpoints. The whole approach
   was applied to quantifying the number of cultivation cycles in a swidden
   agriculture system in Brazil (state of Amazonas). Number and frequency
   of cultivation cycles is of particular ecological relevance in these
   systems since they largely affect the capacity of the forest to
   regenerate after land abandonment. We applied the method to a Landsat
   time-series of Normalized Difference Moisture Index (NDMI) spanning the
   1984-2015 period and derived from it the number of cultivation cycles
   during that period at the individual field scale level. Agricultural
   fields boundaries used to apply the method were derived using a
   multi-temporal segmentation approach. We validated the number of
   cultivation cycles predicted by the method against in-situ information
   collected from farmers interviews, resulting in a Normalized Residual
   Mean Squared Error (NRMSE) of 0.25. Overall the method performed well,
   producing maps with coherent spatial patterns. We identified various
   sources of error in the approach, including low data availability in the
   90s and sub-object mixture of land uses. We conclude that the method
   holds great promise for land use history mapping in the tropics and
   beyond. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Rehabilitation of tailing dams poses important challenges because
   sterile materials and poor or even toxic soils hinder plant development
   and the regeneration of the pre-mining-activity biota. In this study, we
   analyzed the effectiveness of rehabilitating a 14-year-old manganese
   tailing dam by comparing three different regeneration treatments
   (topsoil application, seedling plantation and spontaneous regeneration)
   with undisturbed reference sites. We used soil chemical composition,
   taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic diversity and the above-ground
   tree biomass as indicators of rehabilitation success. In terms of soil
   chemical composition, we showed that the seedling and natural
   regeneration treatments were similar to one another but different from
   the reference sites. Topsoil application presented an intermediate
   chemical composition between the reference site and the other two
   treatments. Moreover, the species richness, Shannon diversity index and
   phylogenetic diversity indicated faster rehabilitation of ecosystem
   biodiversity with the topsoil treatment, although levels from reference
   are not yet achieved. We also observed higher basal area and biomass
   production in the topsoil treatment. However, these patterns were not
   observed for functional diversity, for which no differences among
   treatments were observed. We concluded that topsoil application provided
   the best results; however, we must emphasize that even this approach was
   not sufficient to rehabilitate the system to the similar level of
   biodiversity found in the surrounding ecosystem up to the present.},

Abstract = {Natural tree regeneration in abandoned pastures can be hampered by
   various biotic and abiotic filters, including seed removal and
   predation. We tested the effects of maintenance and removal of grass and
   seed deposition (buried and unburied) on seed germination of 12 tree
   species in dry forest pastures. We obtained evidence supporting the
   hypothesis that seeds attain higher germination under a grass canopy
   than on bare ground. For most species, grass cover provides safety from
   seed predators and facilitates germination by providing a suitable
   microclimate with soil humidity similar to the forest. The hypothesis
   that buried seeds attain higher germination was not supported by our
   data. Predation and removal of unburied seeds ranged from 0 to 77 \%
   and, alone or together, were the major causes of non-germination. Direct
   seeding is a promising technique for revegetation of recently abandoned
   pastures in areas originally covered by tropical dry forests. The high
   germination rate of seeds deposited on the ground and under grass
   reduces costs during initial restoration stages, potentially
   facilitating the spread and use of this technique.},

Abstract = {Remote sensing studies of vegetation cover and hydrologic dynamics in
   Amazonian wetlands have been mostly limited temporally or spatially, and
   the distribution and spatial configuration of Amazonian varzea habitats
   remains poorly known. This study uses multitemporal PALSAR L-band radar
   imagery combined with object-based image analysis, data mining
   techniques and field data to derive vegetation structure and inundation
   patterns and characterize major vegetation types in varzea forests of
   the Mamiraua Sustainable Development Reserve. Our results show that the
   combination of vegetation cover and inundation extent information can be
   a good indicator of the complex gradient of habitats along the
   floodplain. The intersection between vegetation and flood duration
   classes showed a wider range of combinations than suggested from field
   based studies. Chavascal areas-chacaracterized as a dense and
   species-poor shrub/tree community developing in old depressions,
   abandoned channels, and shallow lakes-had shorter inundation periods
   than the usually recognized hydroperiod of 180-240 days of flooding,
   while low varzea-a diverse community that have fewest and smallest
   species, and highest individual density and that tolerate 120-180 days
   of flooding every year-was distributed between flood duration ranges
   that were higher than reported by the literature. Forest communities
   growing at sites that were never mapped as flooded could indicate areas
   that only flood during extreme hydrological events, for short periods of
   time. Our results emphasize the potential contribution of SAR remote
   sensing to the monitoring and management of wetland environments,
   providing not only accurate information on spatial landscape
   configuration and vegetation distribution, but also important insights
   on the ecohydrological processes that ultimately determine the
   distribution of complex floodplain habitat mosaics.},

Abstract = {Poverty, food security, and sustainability are intimately intertwined,
   driving conflict and synergy between environmental and societal
   concerns. Brazil's flagship food security policies were implemented over
   a decade ago to address these issues simultaneously. Global institutions
   have pledged over 2 million US\$ to develop similar programs in
   sub-Saharan Africa, yet empirical assessments of many aspects of these
   policies are still lacking. We focus on a case study in the state of
   Minas Gerais and assess the agricultural and environmental impacts of
   the Purchase with Simultaneous Donation (PSD) program. The PSD provides
   stable markets as incentives to diversify production, but we find no
   effect of participation on changes in local agricultural practices,
   production or income. While some farms are expanding, regional
   agricultural production appears to be declining due to local economic
   development and related shortages in farm labor. The PSD's limited
   impact arises because most farmers only participate irregularly,
   typically during the dry season when the program offers higher prices
   than the local market price. Furthermore, participation is constrained
   by the specific nature of PSD contracts and centralized governance of
   the program. We complement these findings with data from the Brazilian
   Ministry of Social Development and the 2006 agricultural census, which
   show substantial variation in the availability of PSD initiatives, and
   the funding allocated to them at local, regional and national levels. We
   suggest that adaptive management strategies that can respond to local
   market conditions could lead to more equitable and efficient food
   security and agricultural policies in Brazil and elsewhere.},

Abstract = {The area covered by Eucalyptus plantations is significantly increasing
   in Brazil for economic reasons. However, the impact of such land use
   change is still unknown. In this study we evaluated the spatial-temporal
   distribution and abundance of terrestrial non-volant small mammals on a
   recently converted landscape whose matrix is formed by Eucalyptus
   plantations up to 3 years of age. From August 2007 to July 2009 we
   carried out monthly sampling campaigns over a grid of 30 sampling units,
   formed by pitfall traps covering both the landscape matrix of Eucalyptus
   plantations (n = 18) and legal conservation areas of native vegetation
   (n = 7) and abandoned pastures (n = 5). A total of 1640 individuals from
   14 species of the orders Didelphimorphia (4 spp.) and Rodentia (10 spp.)
   were captured. However, only three species of rodents (Olygorysomys
   flavescens, Oligoryzomys nigripes and Calomy tener) represented 81.8\%
   of the total amount. Eucalyptus plantations had a lower species richness
   and abundance than the abandoned pasture and the remaining fragments of
   native vegetation. Although the present species are predominantly
   generalists, there is clear distinction among environments in terms of
   their species composition and relative abundance, which also present a
   pronounced time variation. The assemblage found in this study suggests
   that silvicultural landscapes still have some conservation value, with
   species that seem to be resident at the Eucalyptus plantations.
   Moreover, the presence of the native and abandoned pastures patches
   imbibed in the Eucalyptus plantation matrix may increase the carrying
   capacity of such a silvicultural system and these landscapes may play a
   role in maintaining local biodiversity. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {Objective/Context: This article presents the historical context of the
   creation of Goiania, capital city of the state of Goias, built in the
   1930s as a symbol of the expansion of the demographic and agricultural
   frontier in central Brazil. The city emerged through the Pedro Ludovico
   Teixeira efforts, appointed state intervener by the President Getulio
   Vargas. In the construction process, there was the boosters's discourse,
   which attributed to the promised ``metropolis{''} the power to create
   good opportunities for economic growth. For this, they relied on natural
   resources such as rivers, the presence of rich nearby forests and the
   fields with a less sloping region. Methodology: The study used archival
   sources based on technical and memorialist reports, photographs, maps,
   newspapers and periodicals of the time, as well as bibliography based on
   the theoretical and methodological assumptions of Environmental History.
   Originality: The historiography of Central Brazil has often been
   analyzed from the perspective of the frontier and not from the
   perspective of environmental history. In this paper, we seek to
   appropriate these two issues, reinforcing the relationship between the
   rural and urban processes of the Cerrado environmental history in
   Central Brazil. Conclusions: The real scenario was different from the
   announced one, since nature was much more a barrier than a facilitating
   element of development. In addition, the ideals of modern urbanism were
   partially abandoned due to the opportunism of selling lots. Also, the
   growth took place, but not because of the abundance of natural
   resources, but because of the transfer of the capital that fed it back
   as it attracted new inhabitants.},

Abstract = {In Amazonia, millions of hectares of forest have been converted to
   cattle pasture then abandoned. On sites with histories of heavy use,
   forest recovery is slow. We compared the process of tree establishment
   in an abandoned pasture with a history of heavy use and in a mature
   forest through a series of field studies in northeastern Amazonia. Tree
   seedling and sprout emergence was greater than or equal to 20 times
   lower in the abandoned pasture than in forest understory and forest
   gaps. Tree emergence was restricted in the abandoned pasture by a lad:
   of tree seeds in the soil (3 tree genera vs 15 in the forest), and a low
   rate of tree and liana seed deposition by birds and bats in the open
   vegetation of the abandoned pasture (2 m(-2) yr(-1)). Tree and liana
   seed deposition in the abandoned pasture was higher beneath treelets
   (990 m(-2) yr(-1)). Rates of seed removal and consumption by ants and
   rodents were also higher in the abandoned pasture (>80\% removal within
   20 d for 6 tree species) than in forest understorey and forest gaps.
   Cutter ants (Atta sexdens) hindered tree seedling survivorship and
   growth in the abandoned pasture by clipping leaves and stems, and
   preferred tree seedlings to grass and shrub seedlings. In the absence of
   herbivores, survivorship and height growth of seedling transplants in
   the abandoned pasture were generally lower than in experimental treefali
   gaps, and were correlated with harsh environmental conditions in the
   former. Air temperature, air vapor pressure deficit and soil moisture
   stress in the abandoned pasture exceeded conditions measured in both
   treefall gaps and intact forest during the 5-month dry season. Seedling
   growth in the abandoned pasture was also restricted during the wet
   season. These barriers to tree establishment help explain the low
   density and emergence rates of tree seedlings in this abandoned pasture
   relative to the adjacent mature forest.},

Title = {Marked decline in forest-dependent small mammals following habitat loss
   and fragmentation in an Amazonian deforestation frontier},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {15},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR 11},
Abstract = {Agricultural frontier expansion into the Amazon over the last four
   decades has created million hectares of fragmented forests. While many
   species undergo local extinctions within remaining forest patches, this
   may be compensated by native species from neighbouring open-habitat
   areas potentially invading these patches, particularly as forest
   habitats become increasingly degraded. Here, we examine the effects of
   habitat loss, fragmentation and degradation on small mammal assemblages
   in a southern Amazonian deforestation frontier, while accounting for
   species-specific degree of forest-dependency. We surveyed small mammals
   at three continuous forest sites and 19 forest patches of different
   sizes and degrees of isolation. We further sampled matrix habitats
   adjacent to forest patches, which allowed us to classify each species
   according to forest-dependency and generate a community-averaged
   forest-dependency index for each site. Based on 21,568 trap-nights, we
   recorded 970 small mammals representing 20 species: 12
   forest-dependents, 5 matrix-tolerants and 3 open-habitat specialists.
   Across the gradient of forest patch size, small mammal assemblages
   failed to show the typical species-area relationship, but this
   relationship held true when either species abundance or composition was
   considered. Species composition was further mediated by
   community-averaged forest-dependency, so that smaller forest patches
   were occupied by a lower proportion of forest-dependent rodents and
   marsupials. Both species richness and abundance increased in less
   isolated fragments surrounded by structurally simplified matrix habitats
   (e.g. active or abandoned cattle pastures). While shorter distances
   between forest patches may favour small mammal abundances, forest area
   and matrix complexity dictated which species could persist within forest
   fragments according to their degree of forest-dependency. Small mammal
   local extinctions in small forest patches within Amazonian deforestation
   frontiers are therefore likely offset by the incursion of open-habitat
   species. To preclude the dominance of those species, and consequent
   losses of native species and associated ecosystem functions, management
   actions should limit or reduce areas dedicated to pasture, additionally
   maintaining more structurally complex matrix habitats across fragmented
   landscapes.},

Abstract = {Enrichment planting in logging gaps is an important silvicultural
   treatment to ensure long-term wood production in tropical forests.
   Knowledge on environmental and economic aspects of enrichment planting
   with high commercial value timber species in logging gaps is scarce,
   which creates uncertainty for decision makers about the method
   effectiveness. To contribute to the debate, this work aimed to evaluate
   technically and financially enrichment planting of Swietenia macrophylla
   and Handroanthus serratifolius in logging gaps to serve as a model in
   the recovery and production increase of these species in future cutting
   cycles. An experiment on enrichment planting was established in 46
   logging gaps in 2009 and measurements of planted individuals were done
   in 2011, 2014, and 2017. A cost-benefit analysis using net present value
   (NPV) and a sensitivity analysis were carried out on different interest
   rates for the production of roundwood and sawnwood. Eight years after
   planting, individuals of Swietenia and Handroanthus presented a diameter
   at breast height of 7.88 +/- 1.41 cm and 5.20 +/- 1.00 cm, and a
   Periodic Annual Increment (PAI) of 0.98 +/- 0.38 cm year- 1 and 0.65 +/-
   0.22 cm year- 1, respectively. At the last measurement, Swietenia and
   Handroanthus individuals had a survival percentage of 51\% and 24\% and
   a mortality rate of 8\% and 16\% year- 1, respectively. NPV was positive
   for Swietenia in roundwood and sawnwood harvested at 60 and 90 years
   after planting (2nd and 3rd cutting cycles) and for Handroanthus in
   sawnwood harvested 90 years after planting. Once increasing PAI in 10\%
   and 20\%, Swietenia presented the highest NPVs and Handroanthus was
   profitable with harvest in 60 years and PAI increasing 20\%. Based on
   these results, a model of Swietenia and Handroanthus production and
   conservation through enrichment planting in logging gaps was built.},

Abstract = {Ranching and logging operations are transforming the moist tropical
   forests of an eastern Amazonian landscape into a mosaic of pastures and
   regrowth forests.  The new ecosystems of this region are agriculturally
   unproductive, biologically impoverished, and far more flammable than the
   mature forest they replace; hydrologic differences between the new and
   old ecosystems are unknown and potentially large.  In the absence of
   fire, the forest regrows on abandoned sites, accumulating biomass and
   species at a rate that is inversely related to the intensity of use
   prior to abandonment.  Forest regrows slowest on those rare abondoned
   pastures that were once scraped with bulldozers.  The grass- and
   shrub-dominated old fields that form on some of these sites resist
   forest regrowth because of numerous barriers to tree establishment and
   growth, including:  low propagule availability, seed predation, seedling
   predation, seasonal drought, and root competition with old field
   vegetaion.  Knowledge of these barriers provides a basis for developing
   inexpensive techniques to restore agricultural productivity in old
   fields by implanting tree-based agricultural systems or to restore
   forest regenerative capacity in old fields by establishing trees that
   attract seed-carrying animals and ameliorate harsh environmental
   conditions.  These restoration techniques will be needed over large
   areas of Amazonia if current attempts to reform degraded pastures fail.},

Abstract = {Reduced-impact logging is a key aspect of sustainable forest management
   in the Brazilian Amazon. Real Options Analysis (ROA) improves the
   evaluation of certified projects, increases their value, and supports
   investor confidence. This study evaluates the economic viability of a
   forest management investment project in certified areas of the Brazilian
   Amazon, using ROA to incorporate uncertainty and managerial flexibility
   into the decision-making process. The analysis focused on an
   Ombrophilous Dense Forest in its first cutting cycle, with 30 species of
   diameter at breast height >= 50 cm and a projected activity period of 30
   years. Timber value was modeled using the mean reversion motion, and a
   binomial decision model was applied, incorporating options such as
   deferral, abandonment, and interruption. The deferral option should be
   exercised with a 100\% probability, both in the joint calculation
   scenario and in separate analyses, highlighting the significant value of
   this managerial flexibility. In addition, when analyzed using ROA, the
   value of the project increased by 105\% (USD 91,784,176) compared to the
   traditional net present value approach. The forest management investment
   project in the Brazilian Amazon is economically viable and the
   application of ROA reveals significant value added, demonstrating the
   importance of incorporating flexibility into investment decisions.},

Abstract = {Forest harvest causes disturbances in the forest and affects the
   mortality of residual trees. The effects of this activity on trees of
   the residual stocking for future felling cycles are poorly known in
   post-harvest situations. Detecting mortality patterns and comprehending
   the factors that rule the post-harvest tree mortality may offer
   important subsidies for future sustainable harvests. In this study, the
   mortality of trees under Reduced Impact Logging (RIL) was assessed in a
   chronosequence of 13 years in logging areas (2002-2015) in eastern
   Amazonia. The data were collected in five Units of Annual Production
   (UAP) and in a control plot. In each UAP, a Working Unit (WU) of 100 ha
   was divided into 20 plots of 50 m x 1000 m (5 ha). Trees >= 45 cm DBH
   were inventoried one year before forest harvest and again in 2015. The
   mortality rates were calculated and compared among: (a) ecological
   groups; (b) different logging intensities and (c) diameter classes. The
   mortality rate is higher in the first five years (5.87\%) and the
   effects of RIL are perceived up to seven years post-harvest (3.18\%).
   The logging intensity, 3-40 m(3) ha(-1), did not affect the mortality of
   trees > 45 cm DBH. Pioneer species are more susceptible to impacts of
   forest harvest than species of other ecological groups. In RIL plots, as
   well as in the non-logged plot, the mortality rate was not influenced by
   the size of trees > 45 cm DBH. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {This paper presents the use of geoprocessing tools to predict and to
   develop spatial distribution map of rainfall erosivity (R), and to
   analyze its relationship with land use and management. Espirito Santo
   Slate is located in the Southeastern Region of Brazil, between the
   latitudes -17 degrees 53' and -21 degrees 17' and the longitudes -39
   degrees 39' and -41 degrees 52', with very irregular relief. Rainfall
   data were obtained from 88 rain gauge stations. Land use and management
   data were obtained from the Instituto Brasileiro de Geografra a
   Estatistica (IBGE) and on images of the CBERS-2 (China-Brazil Earth
   Resources) satellite, which has a spatial resolution of 20 m. Empirical
   equations were used to calculate R factor to all the rain gauge
   stations. R factor spatial distribution map was developed using
   spherical kriging interpolator, which was the method that presented
   minors values of percentile average error (6.70\%), root mean square
   error (514.49 m) and the greaters values of correlation coefficient
   (0.71) and index of agreement (0.56). R factor map was classified in:
   high erosivity (HE) (0.851\%), average erosivity (AE) (67.59\%) and low
   erosivity, (LE) (31.54\%). Land use and management was classified in:
   Forest (F) (32\% of the area), Agriculture (A) (58.38\%) and Not
   Vegetated (NV) (9.62\%). Land use and management and R factor maps were
   crossed, using ArcGis 9.2.software, resulting in: F-HE (0.44\%), F-AE
   (23.30\%) and F-LE (8.22\%); A-HE (0.40\%), A-AE (38.54\%) and A-LE
   (19.43\%); NV-HE (0.001\%), NV-AE (5.75\%) and NV-LE (3.88\%). Despite
   of the irregular relief and high rainfall amount of Espirito Santo
   State, HE areas were lower than 1\% of the State. AE areas occupied more
   than 2/3 of the surface, being 38.5\% of this surface was occupied by
   agriculture. These values are preoccupying, because enormous areas of
   degraded pastures are abandoned in this State, causing more intense
   erosion when compared to areas with forest covering. NV areas, which
   generally presents greater susceptibility to erosion, are not
   contributing in an alarming way to soil degradation, therefore
   represents only 9.62\% of total area. Forest covering assists in the
   reduction of runoff due to the damping of the raindrops that improves
   infiltration and reduces soil erosion susceptibility. In general,
   Espirito Santo State doesn't presents high susceptibility to soil
   erosion due to its great vegetal covering. Data presented at this paper
   can be widely used at soil erosion studies, to assist in natural
   resources use, handling and conservation and to apply at environmental
   models of remote sensing software.},

Abstract = {This study aimed to evaluate the growth and survival of seven native
   tree species in different treatments in a degraded area at COPASA
   Reserve (Juramento, MG). Approximately 1.2 ha area was used, where 899
   seedlings were planted of seven native species (Anadenanthera colubrina,
   Copaifera langsdorffii, Dilodendron bipinatum, Miracrodruon urundeuva,
   Pterogyne nitens, Schinopsis brasiliensis and Senegalia polyphylla)
   followed for 24 months. The area was divided into five plots of 0.24 ha,
   which represented the following treatments: (T1) plot sown with grass
   (Brachiaria sp.); (T2) plot where the pits were treated with soil
   conditioner; (T3) plot sown with grass and legumes (Cajanus cajan)
   together; (T4) plot sown with legumes; and (T5) control. The mortality
   percentage was higher in T2 and lower in T3, and the species C.
   langsdorffii (43.66\%) and S. brasiliensis (11.64\%) were the ones with
   higher and lower mortality rate, respectively. The growth (height and
   diameter) of seedlings was higher in T2 (24.32 +/- 26.05 cm and 0.51 +/-
   0.37 mm; respectively) and lowest in T1 (10,82 +/- 22,57 cm and 0,26 +/-
   0,27 mm; respectively). The species with the largest growth in height
   were A. colubrina and S. polyphylla, and D. bipinatum and S.
   brasiliensis showed the highest growth in diameter Pterogyne nitens
   showed the lowest growth, and highest mortality, presenting low ability

Abstract = {This study focuses on a forested area from southwestern Marajo Island,
   mouth of Amazon River, aiming to analyse the relationship between plant
   composition and the latest Quaternary evolution of a land-form with
   palaeochannel morphologies. A floristic survey aiming to characterize
   the inner and outer palaeochannel areas indicated similar
   phytossociological parameters. However, a large volume of species was
   exclusive to only one of these areas. Although the present-day forest is
   fairly uniform, a significant variation in floristic composition was
   recorded according to differences in lithology, topography and
   hydrology. These were determined by the evolution of the physical
   environment associated with successive stages of abandonment of a large
   fluvial drainage system during the latest Pleistocene to Holocene. The
   results derived from this study indicate that reconstruction of a
   physical environment is an important parameter to be taken into account
   before establishing models aiming to explain the distribution of modern

Abstract = {Global initiatives to recover degraded areas have intensified in recent
   years. However, the effectiveness of different reforestation practices
   in restoring habitat stability and essential resources for species over
   time is poorly known. We tested the degree of temporal stability of bee
   and wasp communities reestablishiment in different types of forest
   regeneration compared to intact primary forest in southern Amazonia.
   Using trap-nest sampling, we collected, during 12 months, information
   about the nesting species in six different types of treatments:
   pastures, teak reforestation, fig and mixed native species, natural
   regeneration forest, and forest primary. We observed that in all
   reforested treatments, the abundance and richness of both bees and wasps
   were greater than in pasture sites. However, not all reforestation
   strategies had the same degree of effectiveness in maintaining the
   stability of bee and wasp communities over time than observed in primary
   forest communities. The high temporal variation in teak structure
   promoted high instability in bee and wasp communities over time. In
   contrast, reforestation using perennial species, such as fig or mixed
   species, resulted in a greater temporal stability of bee and wasp
   communities, although dissimilarity to primary forest remained high.
   Communities in natural regeneration were the most similar to primary
   forest, with high similarity of species composition and high temporal
   stability across seasons. Our findings suggest that reforestation
   strategies that promote increased complexity of vegetation structure,
   and better resemble ``natural{''} forests in the provision of habitat
   resources throughout the year, will better restore and maintain
   communities through time.},

Abstract = {Understanding pasture degradation processes is key for sustainable
   development in the Amazon region. Pasture degradation can be indexed by
   pasture nutritional status, which is impacted by environmental and human
   related factors. Most studies of the biogeochernistry of Amazonian
   pastures have been restricted to highly acidic soils with little focus
   on how management affects pasture biogeochemistry. We investigated soil
   physical and chemical properties and grass nutrients under different
   edaphic conditions and management practices in Rond (o) over cap nia
   state, in the southwestern Amazon region. Our objectives were to analyze
   the impacts of soil order, pasture age, and pasture management on soil
   fertility, bulk density and plant nutrients, in order to understand
   sustainability needs for the future of this region. We sampled 17 study
   sites on Oxisols, Ultisols, and Alfisols. The pasture age classes we
   used consisted of 6-10, 11-15, and > 16 years including forest as the
   control. We also evaluated the impact of beef and dairy management
   strategies on pastures installed on Ultisols. Pastures on Alfisols
   showed the highest soil P, Ca, and base saturation, properties that
   decreased gradually after 5 years of pasture installation. In contrast,
   pastures on Oxisols showed low and stable levels of nutrients regardless
   of age. Foliar nutrient concentrations appear to be influenced by
   edaphic conditions. Soil P and foliar P concentration were highly
   correlated. In general, pasture age was a poor indicator of soil
   fertility and foliar chemistry because of high variability among
   pastures belonging to the same soil order. In terms of the impacts of
   pasture management, we did not observe significant differences in soil
   or foliar properties in pasture used for beef and dairy on Ultisols. (c)

Abstract = {The modern Amazonian rainforest has a great fascination and global
   significance, but our knowledge of past landscape changes is still
   limited due to sparse data and the lack of radiometric age constrains.
   Precise dating in records older than the late Pleistocene are difficult
   to obtain and often regionally confined, therefore biostratigraphic
   correlations are used to estimate depositional ages across sedimentary
   basins. Aiming for a better understanding of the Neogene changes in
   western Brazil, we studied palynology and ostracod assemblages from the
   Solimoes Formation, a key site for paleoenvironmental models to discuss
   the biotic changes in Amazonia. Further, we compare the biostratigraphic
   information of both groups with radiometric maximum deposition ages
   constrained by U/Pb measurements on detrital zircon grains.
   Down to the depth of similar to 95 m, zircon populations show a maximum
   deposition age of 11.42 +/- 0.66 Ma documenting Tortonian (late Miocene)
   or younger ages for the top of the Solimoes Formation. Palynological
   biostratigraphy show the Psilatricolporites caribbiensis zone (latest
   Miocene-Pliocene) down to a depth of 181.8 m, where the Grimsdalea
   magnaclavata zone suggests a late middle Miocene to early late Miocene
   age. In comparison, ostracod biostratigraphy indicates the Cyprideis
   cyrtoma zone (late Miocene) down to 176.0 m and the Cyprideis
   minipunctata (late middle to late Miocene) for the bottom of the
   section. Thus, both biostratigraphic concepts suggest ages close to the
   maximum ages indicated by the detrital zircons. This comparison of the
   biozonations with U/Pb maximum deposition ages represents the first
   independent calibration of these widely used methods for age
   determination in the Solimoes Basin.
   Palynological and ostracod data illustrate dynamic environments varying
   from fluvial settings with wetland forests and swamps to lakes and/or
   abandoned channels with temporary slightly saline conditions. Instead of
   a slow evolution of Neogene Amazonian environments, our results show
   migrating rivers and waterbodies surrounded by rainforest during the
   period recorded by the base and top of the studied core material,
   separated by a phase of more extensive lakes and swamps (core depth
   90-120 m). Indicators for slightly elevated salinity are found until the
   topmost sample and thus persisted during the late Miocene.
   This highlights the importance of new age control to improve the
   regional biostratigraphic timescale and reconstructed environmental
   changes.},

Abstract = {Anadenanthera macrocarpa (Benth.) Brenan is a tree species belonging to
   the family Leguminosae-Mimosoideae which is popularly known as
   mimosa-black. It features characteristics of early successional, natural
   occurrence in Brazil and can form clusters almost homogeneous, with
   great potential in the recovery of degraded areas. This study was
   conducted at the Center for Agricultural Sciences, University Federal of
   Alagoas state, aiming at the physical and morphological characterization
   of seeds, describing the various stages of post-seminal development, and
   to evaluate various conditions of temperature and substrate to perform
   the test germination. The seeds were manually extracted, then
   homogenized, where two samples of 50 seeds were used to determine the
   initial moisture. Another sample, consisting of eight repetitions of 100
   seeds was used to measure the biometry and the number of seeds per
   fruit. The morphological characterization and the seeds were immersed in
   distilled water to allow the cuts to the observed structure in
   microscopes. In the post-seminal study, it was observed the daily
   processes of seedling growth in rolled paper filter and constant
   temperature of 30 degrees C. To assess the germination behavior, the
   constant temperatures of 15 degrees C, 25 degrees C, 30 degrees C, 40
   degrees C and 20-30 degrees C as well as the paper and the sand
   substrates were tested and it was evaluated the percentage, the rate of
   germination, the relative frequency distribution, and the tests
   conducted in a randomized design in factorial 5 x 2 (x substrate
   temperature) with four replicates of 25 seeds, and the averages compared
   by Duncan 5\% probability. The fruits of black angico show great
   variation in the seed number per fruit. The embryonic axis occupies part
   of the central region of the seed with axial and linear positions. The
   germination is epigeal and the seedlings are fanerocotylar. The
   temperature determines the 30 degrees C and the filter paper substrate
   provided higher average percentage and germination rate.},

Title = {SPATIAL ANALYSIS WITH GIS OF ENVIRONMENTAL PARAMETERS AND HYDROLOGICAL
   BEHAVIOR (RAINFALL-FLOW) OF A MOUNTAINOUS DRAINAGE BASIN IN SERRA DOS

Abstract = {This paper presents a spatial analysis using Geographic Information
   System of environmental parameters (1: 50.000) and discusses the
   possible influence of these results in the Paquequer watershed
   precipitation-discharge behaviour. This river (5th order, 30 km long)
   begin in the Serra do Mar and flows to Paraiba do Sul river in a 269
   km(2) watershed. The annual rainfall is 1500 mm downstream of the basin
   to more than 3000 mm in its headwater. The summer are wet. In 1996 the
   vegetation of the watershed was fragmented in different stages of
   ecological succession of Ombrophilous Dense Forest - Mata Atlantica and
   25\% of the area was either urban or land use. 3 geological units occur
   in the area (Teresopolis Granite, Batolito Serra dos Orgaos (gnaiss) and
   Rio Negro Unit (migmatite)). The rocky outcrops (5\% of the area) are
   important features of the landscape (especially in Teresopolis Granite).
   Above the rocks there are colluvium, colluvium rich in blocks, regolith
   and little amount of alluvial deposits. The Cambisoils are dominant,
   with few Latosoils (generally associated with Rio Negro Unit) and
   Gleisoils in the valleys. A collection, unification and analysis of
   spatial relationships of geology, soil, slope, deposits, hydrography,
   vegetation and land use data from Teresopolis project (UERJ /IBGE) was
   done with ArcGis Desktop 9.2. The GIS results showed that geology
   controls landscape. Teresopolis Granite landscape has higher slopes,
   many outcrops and colluvium with blocks. Gleisoils and Latosoils are
   important in Rio Negro geological unit. GPR investigation and
   granulometry characterization of a small sub-basin identified
   geophysical and granulometry patterns for fresh rock, soil and colluvium
   with blocks. At Parnaso Station (INMET) (headwater of the Paquequer
   basin) rained 2945 mm in the monitored year, while at the Providence
   Station (UERJ/CPRM) (outlet of the basin) 1447 mm. November to March
   were the most rainy months and from June to September the dryest. The
   average yearly Paquequer river flow discharge is 5.6 m(3)/s. Monthly
   flow discharge has the same trend of monthly precipitation and is
   controlled by headwater rainfall. Peak flow from a headwaters rainfall
   event has a 10 to 34 hours lagtime to reach the outlet of the basin.
   Rock outcrops, urban land use and less developed soils (Cambisoils and
   Litosoils) are responsible for faster flows. Meanwhile the elongated
   shape, the colluvium and the regolith are slower flows sources, showing
   a good relationship between headwater rainfall and basin outlet water
   flow.},

Abstract = {Different forest systems can influence the function, traits, diversity,
   and distribution of ferns. By comparing ferns based on their functional
   traits, we can explore how species loss affects functional diversity,
   and consequently alter the forest ecosystem. We investigated the impact
   of abandoned silviculture on fern diversity (taxonomic and functional)
   and abundance. Our hypothesis suggests a positive effect of nutrients
   and soil humidity in native forests, while canopy openness in
   silviculture has a negative effect on monilophyte diversity. This study
   was conducted in three sites of native forest and three sites of Pinus
   silviculture. Each site was subdivided into three areas, with three
   plots per area, resulting in 54 plots (3 sites x 3 areas x 3 plots x 2
   forest types). Each plot covered an area of 100 m2 (10 m x 10 m; 5400 m2
   in total). In each plot, we estimated abundance, functional attributes
   (richness, evenness, divergence, and dispersion) based on leaf
   thickness, leaf width, petiole length, stem length, leaf division, sori
   shape, indusium presence, and taxonomic diversity. Results indicate that
   native forest exhibit higher taxonomic and functional diversity
   (richness-Fric) compared to abandoned Pinus plantations, which may be
   attributed to high habitat diversity and species specialization in
   specific microhabitats. In silviculture, diversity homogenization leads
   to an increase in the redundancy of functional attributes
   (evenness-Feve), resulting in the filtering out of similar organisms.
   Abiotic factors such as light and canopy openness negatively influence
   plant establishment and growth, leading to a decrease in leaf division
   and indusium presence/absence (by CWMs), supporting niche
   complementarity theory in natural forest and mass ratio theory in
   silviculture. Our findings highlight the enduring negative impact of
   silviculture, even after 20 years, on both the taxonomic and functional
   diversity of monilophytes, underscoring the crucial role of native
   forests in preserving fern diversity.

Abstract = {We investigated the efficiency of different kinds of perches in
   attracting seed disperser-birds and increasing the seed rain in a
   degraded area located in the northeast region of Sao Paulo State. We
   installed seed traps under natural perches (NPs, living trees); simple
   artificial perches (SAPs) of 3m tall and a crossbar; elaborate
   artificial perches (EAPs) of 7m tall and three crossbars, and in a
   control area. Results showed the number of bird-dispersed seeds
   deposited was proportional to the number of structures for perching. The
   NPs also have provided other resources for birds such as food and
   shelter. Comparing visitation between artificial perches, there was
   greater use of EAPs also for having more perching structures and for
   being taller, providing better airspace visibility for predatory birds
   and tyrant-flycatchers, important seed dispersers. Thus, natural and
   artificial perches with similar characteristics to the EAPs are the most
   recommended as a base or complementary method for the restoration of
   degraded areas near to propagules source, also contributing to the
   maintenance of local fauna.},

Abstract = {Harvesting and conversions of forest areas to alternative land use in
   the Amazon region, especially in the Amapa state, result in large
   amounts of wood residues that are generally abandoned. This problem
   about the forest residues and mainly of its loss and the lack of
   alternatives for its proper use, resulted in this research proposal that
   aimed to produce handcrafted rustic furniture as an alternative to the
   use of wood residues from the Amazon forest. Wood residues left in the
   field after harvesting the managed Amazon forest were collected and
   destined for the manufacture of rustic furniture, obtaining the
   following prototypes as a final result: log bench, bar counter, wood
   dresser, wood sink, coffee table with wood top, coffee table with glass
   top. The technical feasibility of handcrafting furniture pieces using
   portable machines and tools were tested. Wood residues proved to be an
   excellent source of raw material for rustic furniture, enabling multiple
   design alternatives, although certain difficulties were evidenced during
   the process such as: weight, hardness, wood grain orientation, among
   others that did not prevent the furniture production. The use of wood
   residues to rustic furniture manufacture can constitute a new and
   entrepreneurial business for the Amazon region, contributing to the
   generation of local income. It was found that the method used provided
   the production of original furniture, which adds value to its marketing.},

Abstract = {Arid and semiarid ecosystems display several environmental filters
   naturally restricting plant community composition. Such filters become
   more severe after some disturbance and may thus hamper the survival of
   young plants. The role of remnant trees in succession needs to be better
   understood to identify patterns and functional traits that might
   facilitate natural regeneration in drylands. This study evaluated the
   role of remnant trees in the succession process in the caatinga
   vegetation (Brazilian seasonally dry tropical forest), testing the
   effect of a typical tree, the juazeiro (Ziziphus joazeiro Mart.) in
   richness and abundance of seedlings in areas of abandoned pasture, in
   Northeastern Brazil. A perimeter was outlined around each plant (n = 20)
   with a diameter equivalent to each tree crown; all seedlings of woody
   species up to 0.5 m in height, within that perimeter, were collected and
   identified. Control areas with the same dimensions were delimited in
   adjacent locations (n = 20) without the influence of remnant trees,
   followed by the same data surveys. Mean species richness was of 7.8 +/-
   4.8 under the juazeiro canopies, compared to 2.3 +/- 1.9 in the control
   areas. Species abundance was also greater under the presence of Z.
   joazeiro, with an average of 16.9 +/- 4.8, against 4.1 +/- 4.2
   individuals in the controls. Among the abiotic factors evaluated, it is
   suggested that soil and air temperatures may show a greater influence on
   the recruitment of seedlings, benefiting natural regeneration under Z.
   joazeiro. Z. joazeiro ramnant trees appear to facilitate the natural
   regeneration of tropical drylands. We suggest considering the use of
   these plants as catalysts for the nucleation process in the restoration
   of the caatinga.},

Abstract = {Understanding the processes that shape biotic interactions within
   biological communities helps us to develop strategies for the
   establishment of ecological communities and to rehabilitate the
   functionality of degraded environments.
   We evaluated the functional diversity of cavity-nesting bees and wasps
   and their interaction networks established with nest parasites in
   different types of reforestation in Southern Amazonia. To do so, we used
   bee and wasp trap-nests to sample six different types of environments:
   pasture, teak reforestation, fig reforestation, mixed reforestation,
   natural regeneration and primary forest.
   Although the bees' functional diversity indices evaluated did not vary
   between reforestation types and natural forests, the functional traits
   of these insects were quite different in reforestation with planting
   species, especially teak. For wasps, we observed lower functional
   diversity in pasture, fig plantation and mixed reforestation. Moreover,
   we observed that while teak reforestation presented the highest parasite
   richness, parasitism rate and diversity of interactions, natural
   regeneration shows higher interaction specialisation.
   Our results indicate that the simplification of the structure of
   reforested environments contributes to increase the divergence in the
   functional diversity of cavity-nesting bee and wasp community and the
   interactions they establish with their parasites in relation to natural
   environments. However, these differences can be reduced by structuring
   the environment. Thus, natural regeneration can be a favourable strategy
   if the degraded areas are not severely impacted and present proximity to
   the source of propagules.},

Title = {Photosynthetic responses to temperature across the tropics: a
   meta-analytic approach},
Journal = {ANNALS OF BOTANY},
Year = {2025},
Month = {2025 FEB 27},
Abstract = {Background and Aims Tropical forests exchange more carbon dioxide (CO2)
   with the atmosphere than any other terrestrial biome. Yet, uncertainty
   in the projected carbon balance over the next century is roughly three
   times greater for the tropics than other for ecosystems. Our limited
   knowledge of tropical plant physiological responses, including
   photosynthetic, to climate change is a substantial source of uncertainty
   in our ability to forecast the global terrestrial carbon sink.
   Methods We used a meta-analytic approach, focusing on tropical
   photosynthetic temperature responses, to address this knowledge gap. Our
   dataset, gleaned from 18 independent studies, included leaf-level
   light-saturated photosynthetic (A(sat)) temperature responses from 108
   woody species, with additional temperature parameters (35 species) and
   rates (250 species) of both maximum rates of electron transport (J(max))
   and Rubisco carboxylation (V-cmax). We investigated how these parameters
   responded to mean annual temperature (MAT), temperature variability,
   aridity and elevation, as well as also how responses differed among
   successional strategy, leaf habit and light environment.
   Key Results Optimum temperatures for A(sat) (T-optA) and J(max) (T-optJ)
   increased with MAT but not for V-cmax (T-optV). Although photosynthetic
   rates were higher for `light' than `shaded' leaves, light conditions did
   not generate differences in temperature response parameters. T-optA did
   not differ with successional strategy, but early successional species
   had similar to 4 degrees C wider thermal niches than mid/late species.
   Semi-deciduous species had similar to 1 degrees C higher T-optA than
   broadleaf evergreen species. Most global modelling efforts consider all
   tropical forests as a single `broadleaf evergreen' functional type, but
   our data show that tropical species with different leaf habits display
   distinct temperature responses that should be included in modelling
   efforts.
   Conclusions This novel research will inform modelling efforts to
   quantify tropical ecosystem carbon cycling and provide more accurate
   representations of how these key ecosystems will respond to altered
   temperature patterns in the face of climate warming.},

Title = {Ethnobotany in a coastal environmental protected area: shifts in plant
   use in two communities in southern Brazil},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ETHNOBIOLOGY AND ETHNOMEDICINE},
Year = {2018},

Abstract = {BackgroundWe investigated local knowledge of plants in terms of plant
   use shifts and losses, in two coastal communities within a protected
   area in southern Brazil. Our hypothesis is that people's livelihoods are
   associated with different ethnobotanical knowledge, and changes in these
   activities can reflect shifts in ethnobotanical knowledge such as
   stopping using some plants.MethodsWe interviewed 125 inhabitants after
   prior informed consent, asking her/him about their socioeconomic profile
   and to free list the plants they know. The free lists were analyzed by
   frequency of cited plants. To compare averages of cited plants and age
   in both communities, we used the Wilcoxon test with a significance of
   5\%. Spearman correlation was tested with number of plants cited in the
   past and the interviewees' age. Permanence and change in economic
   activities in each community were represented using a graph and compared
   through a chi-squared test with a significance of 5\%. Qualitative
   analyses of the interviews and a field diary were used to analyze
   driving forces for the abandonment of used plants.ResultsWe identified
   231 plant species that were currently used mainly for food and medicine.
   Despite being in a protected area, most of the cited plants were exotic
   and cultivated in home gardens. We do not confirm the hypothesis that
   changes in livelihoods are reflected in the plants used; however,
   qualitative analyses showed potential drivers for shifts and losses of
   plant use. Environmental law and protected area were the drivers most
   related to the abandonment of plant use.ConclusionsWhile recognizing the
   importance of the protected area to maintain local people and their
   traditions, we documented a shift in plant use that is mainly correlated
   to construction activities that disappeared from daily practices.},

Abstract = {We studied the potential contribution of frugivorous bats to the
   reestablishment of vegetational diversity in a restored area. We
   analysed the diets of the bat species and the differences between them
   in the consumption of fruits of autochtonous and allochthonous species.
   Planted (autochtonous) species were the basis of diets, especially
   Solanum mauritianum and Cecropia pachystachya, whereas for allochthonous
   species we found that Piperaceae to be of particular importance.
   Carollia perspicillata was the main seed disperser for allochthonous
   species, and potentially the most important bat in the promotion of
   vegetation diversity in the study area. Our results suggest that
   frugivorous bats are especially important in the reestablishment of
   vegetation in disturbed areas, and that restorarion efforts should focus
   on the planting of different zoochorous species that would guarantee a
   high year-round fruit production, thereby facilitating natural plant
   reestablishment by frugivorous bats in regenerating areas. (C) 2010

   restoration effects on forest recovery},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {12},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB 3},
Abstract = {Global forest restoration targets have been set, yet policy makers and
   land managers lack guiding principles on how to invest limited resources
   to achieve them. We conducted a meta-analysis of 166 studies in
   naturally regenerating and actively restored forests worldwide to
   answer: (1) To what extent do floral and faunal abundance and diversity
   and biogeochemical functions recover? (2) Does recovery vary as a
   function of past land use, time since restoration, forest region, or
   precipitation? (3) Does active restoration result in more complete or
   faster recovery than passive restoration? Overall, forests showed a high
   level of recovery, but the time to recovery depended on the metric type
   measured, past land use, and region. Abundance recovered quickly and
   completely, whereas diversity recovered slower in tropical than in
   temperate forests. Biogeochemical functions recovered more slowly after
   agriculture than after logging or mining. Formerly logged sites were
   mostly passively restored and generally recovered quickly. Mined sites
   were nearly always actively restored using a combination of planting and
   either soil amendments or recontouring topography, which resulted in
   rapid recovery of the metrics evaluated. Actively restoring former
   agricultural land, primarily by planting trees, did not result in
   consistently faster or more complete recovery than passively restored
   sites. Our results suggest that simply ending the land use is sufficient
   for forests to recover in many cases, but more studies are needed that
   directly compare the value added of active versus passive restoration
   strategies in the same system. Investments in active restoration should
   be evaluated relative to the past land use, the natural resilience of
   the system, and the specific objectives of each project.},

Abstract = {Indigenous peoples, in the Brazilian Amazon, have contributed a lot to
   the domestication of countless plant species used by the contemporary
   population as a whole. However, these peoples currently face legal
   limitations to market their forest products produced in a sustainable
   manner. In this regard, the study aimed to show the population structure
   of Schizolobium parahyba var amazonicum (Huber ex Ducke) Barneby, in
   environments conducive to natural regeneration and native forest. The
   species is used in the laminate industry in the region. The research
   also aims to contribute to the generation of indicators for discussion
   about the legal aspects of forestry to conduct natural regeneration in
   indigenous lands, in the Brazilian Amazon. To conduct the study, three
   environments of occurrence of the referred species were sampled: forests
   in climax and altered, and area under natural regeneration of the
   species, conducted by the original peoples, both environments located in
   the Amazon biome. The result of the study found that in the climax and
   altered forest the species has its population reduced due to its
   ecological character, since it is heliophile. Regarding the environment
   under natural regeneration, the same species showed structural
   differentiation from the other environments, demonstrating the effect of
   the forestry practice of conducting regeneration, in the form of
   polyculture, associated with other agricultural species. However, the
   lack of legal support for the commercialization of wood by native
   peoples discourages this sustainable forestry practice, and encourages
   simplified cultivation such as coffee and other single agricultural
   crops.},

Abstract = {Despite scientific concern about Amazon deforestation and the impacts of
   the Amazon gold rush, few researchers have assessed the long-term
   impacts of small-scale gold mining on forest cover. This study estimates
   deforestation from gold mining and analyses the regeneration of
   abandoned mining areas in the Suriname Amazon. Fieldwork in December
   1998 included observations and ecological measurements, as well as
   qualitative interviews with local miners about mining history and
   technology. Vegetation cover of abandoned mining sites of different ages
   was compared with that in old-growth forest. By present estimates, gold
   miners clear 48-96 km(2) of old-growth forest in Suriname annually.
   Based on different assumptions about changes in technology and the
   amount of mining that takes place on previously mined sites, cumulative
   deforestation is expected to reach 750-2280 km(2) by 2010. Furthermore,
   the analysis of abandoned mining sites suggests that forest recovery
   following mining is slow and qualitatively inferior compared to
   regeneration following other land uses. Unlike areas in nearby
   old-growth forest, large parts of mined areas remain bare ground, grass,
   and standing water. The area deforested by mining may seem relatively
   small, but given the slow forest recovery and the concentration of
   mining in selected areas, small-scale gold mining is. expected to reduce
   local forest cover and ecosystem services in regions where mining takes
   place.},

Abstract = {In the present study, we describe the temporal and spatial variability
   in recruitment, growth, and mortality rates of seedlings and saplings of
   two low-density neotropical tree species, Dipteryx odorata and Copaifera
   reticulata in Eastern Amazonia, Brazil. As both species have important
   timber and non-timber uses, for each species we compare regeneration
   parameters among different management scenarios (sites used for timber
   logging, non-timber product extraction, and undisturbed forests).
   Results suggest that both species share similar natural regeneration
   characteristics. These include temporally and spatially asynchronous
   germination, existence of individuals that have more abundant and
   frequent fruit production than the average of the population and a
   positive influence of the mother tree crown on seedling and sapling
   density. The management activities analyzed did not influence the
   regeneration parameters of both species, which suggests that timber
   logging the way it was performed and current rates of D. odorata seed
   gathering and C. reticulata tapping at the study site are not
   sufficiently intense to threaten species population. However, some
   species characteristics, such as their reproductive strategies,
   light-demanding syndromes, low-dispersal ranges, and high-mortality
   rates of seedlings make both species vulnerable to exploitation.},

Abstract = {1. Despite considerable research into the effects of leaf-cutting ant
   nests, the potential occurrence of low-nutrient soils at nest sites has
   hitherto gone undetected.
   2. Leaf litter cover and topsoil conditions (organic carbon, total
   nitrogen, soil acidity, cation exchange capacity) were assessed along
   transects running from nests of eight adult Atta cephalotes colonies
   into the understorey of Atlantic forest to examine the extent of nest
   effects.
   3. Nests were virtually free of leaf litter (c. 150 gm(-2)) and litter
   cover increased along a saturating curve with nest distance, reaching
   1300 gm(-2) in the undisturbed forest. Soil acidity and nutrient
   concentrations were strongly correlated with leaf litter cover (r =
   0.66-0.72) for both soil types occurring in the study region. Total soil
   nitrogen concentration varied from 0.2 g kg(-1) in sandy nest soil and
   0.5 g kg(-1) in clay-rich nest soil to 0.5 and 1.3 g kg(-1),
   respectively, at a distance of 24m from nests, while soil carbon
   concentration ranged from 2.1 to 6.1 g kg(-1) (sandy soil) and 4.5 to
   15.7 g kg(-1) (clay-rich soil) over the same distance. Nest-associated
   variations in edaphic parameters suggest that each colony affected an
   area of up to 0.5 ha.
   4. In contrast to the common perception that leaf-cutting ant activities
   increase nutrient availability, our results suggest that their
   territories are characterised by reduced levels of leaf litter and,
   consequently, soil nutrients.
   5. The observed nutrient depletion must be taken into account when
   considering the potential impacts of ant nests for plant regeneration.},

Abstract = {The objective of this work was to perform a survey of the main species
   derived from the propagules present on the topsoil over bauxite mines in
   ``Altitude Fields in Atlantic Forest{''}, as a form to suggest potential
   species for recovering degraded areas. Samples were taken from the first
   five centimeters of substrate containing the area propagative material.
   The samples were housed in a nursery where we counted the plant
   emergences every 24 hours, identifying the individuals at the end. The
   abundance and diversity indexes were calculated. In this study, three of
   the higher occurrence species were common in both periods (dry and
   rainy): Ageratum fastigiatum, Echinolaena inflexa and Borreria
   latifolia. The value found for the Shannon Index (H') for the species
   derived from propagules on the topsoil in vegetation in the altitude
   fields in Atlantic Forest during the dry period were of 2.79 nats.
   ind(-1) and during the rainy period was of 2.23 nats. ind(-1). Pielou's
   equability observed for the dry period was of 0.72 and for the rainy
   period was of 0.63. The similarity between both periods was of 0.36.
   Comparing the response variable number of individuals between both
   periods, we identified a statistical difference with a larger mean for
   the dry period. According to the conditions this work was performed in,
   it is possible to ascertain that there are species with potential to
   recover mined areas in vegetation in altitude fields. Therefore, we
   suggest that ecology complementary studies are performed on these
   species and seed technology as a way to fundament the application of
   this knowledge in mined area recovery practices.},

Abstract = {One of the main barriers to restoration is the arrival of diaspores in
   degraded areas. However, this process can be hampered in open areas
   without trees in the landscape. For that, artificial perches are used to
   attract and provide a landing area for avian seed dispersers, to enhance
   seed rain. Our objective was to evaluate the effect of the distance of
   artificial perches in relation to a forest fragment on the diversity and
   composition of seed rain in an agricultural fallow area, including alien
   invasive plant species. We also aimed to record and characterize the
   bird species that potentially act as seed dispersers. Thus, we used
   artificial perches at three different distances from a forest fragment
   (5, 25, and 50 m). Four seed traps were arranged under the perches at
   each distance, and four control seed traps were interspersed with these
   and distanced at 7.5 m. Furthermore, we placed four seed traps inside
   the forest fragment at 5 m from the edge. We also carried out 80 h of
   focal observation of the avifauna that used artificial perches. A total
   of 24 655 seeds were sampled across all treatments. There was a
   significant difference in seed abundance and richness between artificial
   perches, control seed traps, and forest seed traps. Seed deposition
   increased with distance from the forest fragment (50, 25, and 5 m). An
   ordination procedure indicated the formation of three plant seed
   communities, with the forest community being most distinct. The invasive
   exotic species Pittosporum undulatum (Australian cheesewood) was the
   third most abundant in the seed rain. We observed 24 bird species from
   12 families using artificial perches. The Tyrannidae family was the most
   represented. We showed that artificial perches are efficient structures
   for attracting birds, increasing the richness and abundance of seed
   species. Artificial perches at 25 and 50 m were more efficient possibly
   due to the provision of greater visibility for birds. Therefore,
   artificial perches are efficient in increasing seed rain in the fallow
   area but should be used with caution in landscapes with the presence of
   alien species. These findings contribute to increasing knowledge about
   overcoming the first barrier to ecological restoration, which is the
   arrival of diaspores in degraded areas, and showing the importance of
   birds in this process.},

Title = {Soil properties and microclimate of two predominant landscapes in the
   Brazilian semiarid region: Comparison between a seasonally dry tropical
   forest and a deforested area},
Journal = {SOIL \& TILLAGE RESEARCH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {207},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The Brazilian semiarid region has been subjected to strong man-made
   actions since the 1970s, which have resulted in landscape
   transformation. The scientific literature presents several studies on
   the soil properties or microclimate of different types of landscapes;
   however, less attention was having been paid to the surface contrast
   between native vegetation and bare soil. The objective of this research
   was to evaluate the soil properties and microclimate of two common
   landscapes in the Brazilian semiarid region, a seasonally dry tropical
   forest (Caatinga) and a deforested area. Soil and microclimate data were
   obtained from two sites, both located in the State of Pernambuco,
   Brazil. Soil samples were collected on six dates and from layers, and
   microclimate variables were measured for three years. Soil properties
   and microclimatic data were evaluated using the Mann-Whitney test, as
   well as regression and principal component analysis. Successive years of
   agricultural practices affected the bulk density, promoting an increase
   in the total porosity of the soil in the deforested area site. In
   addition, changes were verified in the magnitude of many chemical
   properties (pH, P, K+, Mg2+, Cu2+, Fe, Mn, Zn2+ and Ca2+), indicating
   soil degradation. Compared with the Caatinga forest site, the minimum
   air temperature was 2.3 degrees C, and the maximum vapor pressure
   deficit was 7\% higher in the deforested area site, and it is very
   likely that Caatinga removal there will lead to a reduction in
   precipitation. The results suggest that Caatinga vegetation removal
   followed by agricultural practices and subsequent land abandonment
   promotes significant changes in soil properties and the microclimate,
   which can contribute to advances in desertification and affects
   agricultural activities in the Brazilian semiarid region.},

Abstract = {As deforestation and land-use/land-cover change advance in tropical
   forest regions, an understanding of how plants adjust phenology and
   reproductive dynamics to altered landscapes can provide insights into
   plasticity, productivity, and population persistence. We compared the
   reproductive phenology, sex expression, and flower and fruit production
   of two monoecious Amazonian palms, Attalea phalerata and Attalea
   speciosa, in old-growth forest and as remnant trees growing in actively
   grazed pastures. Using 2 years of phenology data collected from natural
   populations near Vila Extrema, Rondonia, and eastern Acre, Brazil, we
   compared flowering and fruiting in the two habitats and tested for
   effects of palm height, crown size, and light availability on
   inflorescence and sex expression. Forest conversion to pasture
   stimulated greater overall flowering and fruiting in individual Attalea
   palms. As a population, remnant pasture palms continuously bore flowers
   and fruits year-round, while forest palms flowered seasonally in
   isolated peaks with consecutive months of inactivity. Crown size and
   greater light exposure affected flowering and fruiting dynamics in A.
   phalerata and A. speciosa, respectively, and increased light
   availability shifted A. speciosa sex expression towards greater female
   investment, primarily through regulation of sex determination and bud
   abortion. Removal of tropical forest does not always lead to the
   downfall of remnant tree populations, and under favorable conditions,
   such as abandonment of cropland and pasture, higher levels of
   reproduction can facilitate recovery of future generations. Tree species
   with flexible sex expression may be particularly resilient in the face
   of land-use and land-cover change.},

Abstract = {Forestry fragments are important to biodiversity maintenance, thus it is
   developing studies aiming to get information focused on the
   conservation, recovery and management of these environments. Therefore,
   aimed at featuring the horizontal structure, flora diversity and the
   influence of the soil variables from the arboreal-shrubby component
   within a Floresta Ombrofila Mista fragment. The survey on vegetation was
   performed in nineteen 10 x 20 m plots. Within these plots, the
   individuals were identified and measured according to the following size
   classes: Class I - individuals presenting DAP (circumference measured
   1.30 m from soil surface) >= 15 cm and Class II CAP < 15 cm e diameter
   >= 1 cm. The vegetation was analyzed according to phytosociological
   parameters and to a correlation between the vegetation and the soil
   variables by means of a Canonical Correspondence Analysis. The fragment
   presents low diversity and the prevalence of few species in the bigger
   size class, among which stands out Araucaria angustifolia. However, its
   reduced density regarding natural regeneration may impair its own
   conservation within the local. Species such as Myrceugenia cucullata and
   Gymnanthes klotzschiana are preserved in the forest. There is influence

Volume = {7},
Number = {1-2, SI},
Pages = {341-348},
Abstract = {Background: Plant succession and community assembly following different
   land-use histories in the Amazon Basin are poorly understood.
   Aims: Changes in woody vegetation were monitored across chronosequences
   of abandoned pastures and abandoned clearcuts in order to compare their
   successional patterns.
   Methods: In chronosequences, initially 5-19 years old in abandoned
   clearcuts and 2-11 years old in abandoned pastures, trees (>= 3 cm dbh)
   were tagged and recruitment and mortality recorded annually for 12
   years.
   Results: Stem densities exhibited no significant trend during the first
   25 years of succession regardless of land-use history. Basal area in
   abandoned clearcuts increased rapidly in the first decade, outpacing
   accumulation in abandoned pastures, although basal area on the two
   pathways converged at 25 years post-abandonment. Transects in abandoned
   pastures were much more variable in stem density and basal area than
   those in abandoned clearcuts, reflecting cohort growth and thinning by
   the dominant genus Vismia in the pastures. Species density, initially
   similar in the young stands, increased at a much faster rate in
   abandoned clearcuts than in abandoned pastures, resulting in a large
   divergence after 25 years.
   Conclusions: Succession following deforestation in the Amazon exhibits
   alternative pathways that correspond to prior land use - abandoned
   clearcuts of primary forest or clearcuts converted to pastures through
   prescribed burns and later abandoned. The most important divergence in
   the two successions was the extremely slow accumulation of species over
   25 years in abandoned pastures.},

Abstract = {Amazonian farmers and ranchers use fire to clear land for agriculture
   and pasture as part of extensive land-use strategies that have
   deforested 500 000 km(2) over the past 25 years. Ash from burning
   biomass fertilizes crops and pastures, but declining productivity often
   occurs after a few years, generally leading to land abandonment and
   further clearing. Subsequent forest regrowth partially offsets carbon
   emissions from deforestation, but is often repeatedly cleared and
   burned. In the first quantitative, basin-wide assessment of the effect
   of repeated clearing and burning on forest regrowth, our analysis of
   data from 90 stands at nine locations across the region indicates that
   stands with a history of five or more fires suffer on average a greater
   than 50\% reduction in carbon accumulation. In the absence of management
   interventions, Amazonian landscapes dominated by this pronounced legacy
   of fire are apt to accumulate very little carbon and will remain highly
   susceptible to recurrent burning.},

Abstract = {Mining in the municipality of Capit \& atilde;o Po \& ccedil;o, Par \&

   the objective of this study was to evaluate the stocks of the elements
   N, P, K+, Na+, Ca (2+), Mg2+, Fe, Zn, Cu and Mn in roots under areas
   undergoing recovery by pebble mining in Par \& aacute; , Brazil. The
   study was carried out in four areas, namely the area under recovery with
   soil bioengineering techniques (complementary construction technique and
   soil stabilization technique), the area under recovery with a natural
   regeneration process, the degraded area and the native forest , located
   in the municipality of Capit \& atilde;o Po \& ccedil;o. To analyze the
   element stocks in roots, roots were collected at depths 0-10, 10-20,
   20-30, 30-40, 40-50, 50-60, 60-80 and 80-100 cm, then quantified the dry
   biomass and macro and micronutrients. To obtain the results, the element
   stocks in roots were subjected to the Shapiro and Wilk normality tests
   and analysis of variance. Means were compared using the Tukey test at
   5\% significance using the SISVAR statistical software. The highest
   average values of Na+, Ca2+, Mg2+ in fine roots were in areas with
   bioengineering and native forest. Furthermore, the native forest
   presented the highest average values of macro and micronutrients in fine
   and thick roots. Furthermore, the lowest stocks of elements in roots
   were in the degraded area. However, bioengineering techniques are
   effective in recovering degraded soils, as vegetation cover
   reestablishes the balance of the soil-plant system.},

Abstract = {Spondias tuberosa Arr., a fructiferous tree endemic to the northeast
   Brazilian tropical dry forest called Caatinga, accounts for numerous
   benefits for its ecosystem as well as for the dwellers of the Caatinga.
   The tree serves as feed for pollinators and dispersers as well as fodder
   for domestic ruminants, and is a source of additional income for local
   smallholders and their families. Despite its vantages, it is facing
   several man-made and natural threats, and it is suspected that S.
   tuberosa could become extinct. Literature review suggests that S.
   tuberosa suffers a reduced regeneration leading to population decrease.
   At this juncture S. tuberosa cannot be considered threatened according
   to the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List
   Categories and Criteria, as it has not yet been assessed and hampered
   generative regeneration is not considered in the IUCN assessment. The
   combination of threats, however, may have already caused an extinction
   debt for S. tuberosa. Due to the observed decline in tree density, a
   thorough assessment of the S. tuberosa population is recommended, as
   well as a threat assessment throughout the entire Caatinga.},

Abstract = {In the southern part of the Atlantic Forest region, in Santa Catarina,
   Brazil, coal mining has led to severe degradation, with former mining
   areas abandoned decades ago without any concern about environmental and
   social damage. Up to recently, little restoration activity had been
   developed, despite severe and ongoing environmental degradation that
   also causes risks to human health. We argue that these areas should be
   made restoration priority, and that the development of specific
   restoration actions and measures for sites like these are urgent. To
   achieve effective restoration planning we must overcome some challenges,
   such as prioritization of areas for restoration, establishment long-term
   monitoring, development of realistic goals, avoidance of the use of
   invasive grasses, and inclusion of human population and their needs into
   discussion of restoration goals and approached. We recognize that, due
   to pollution and contamination problems, cost for restoration is a
   massive challenge in the region, but even higher costs for population
   and environment are expected if sites would not be restored. Considering
   the environment and human health risks of areas degraded by coal mining,
   restoration efforts should be of high priority on all level of
   governance, and ways should be found to include this into the procedures
   for prioritization of restoration activities. (c) 2017 Associacao

Abstract = {Vertical artificial structures can serve as artificial roosts attracting
   birds and increase the seed rain. The purpose of this work was to study
   the efficiency of different types of artificial roosts as seed dispersal
   nuclei in a cerrado (Neotropical savannah) area under natural
   regeneration. Three types of artificial roosts were installed
   ({''}X{''}, ``3X{''} and ``wire{''}) and the species of birds using them
   and plant species in the seed rain were monitored for a year. The
   efficiency of the roosts was measured by comparing the seed rain with
   natural roosts (control). We recorded 760 individuals of 24 species of
   birds on the artificial roosts. There were more dispersed seeds under
   artificial roosts than under natural roosts. We collected 607 samples of
   feces, 569 under artificial roosts (containing 5252 seeds) and 38 under
   natural roosts (containing 228 seeds). The seeds were of 21
   species/morphospecies. The 3X roost was the most used by birds, but the
   seed rain was similar between 3X and X roosts. We also recorded more
   seeds under artificial roosts than under natural roosts. Cyanocorax
   cristatellus (Curl-crested jay), an omnivorous bird, was the most
   frequent bird recorded at the artificial roosts and seeds of Miconia
   species were dominant in the seed rain. Artificial roosts were efficient
   as seed dispersal nuclei and can be adopted as a method to accelerate
   the regeneration of degraded areas. Research that focuses on artificial
   roost structure and the factors that influence the seed rain is useful
   to define targeted and more efficient strategies to habitat restoration.},

Abstract = {Phyllomedusa tarsius is a hylid frog that breeds in ponds located in a
   range of habitats from continuous forests to severely disturbed matrix
   habitats in Central Amazon. During three reproductive seasons, we
   followed the movement patterns, measured body size and registered
   abundance and residency time of this species in five habitats: pasture,
   Vismia regrowth, Cecropia regrowth, 1 and 10 ha forest fragments, and
   continuous forest. The frog captures were strongly correlated with
   rainfall in all disturbed habitats, but not in continuous forest,
   probably because individuals respond more directly to rainfall patterns
   in more open habitats. Males in disturbed habitats were smaller than
   those found in continuous forest, perhaps as a result of differences in
   habitat quality. Males remained at sites for longer periods in fragments
   and continuous forest compared to matrix habitats. Here again, the
   quality and suitability of breeding sites in matrix habitats may be
   lower than in continuous forest resulting in the need for more movement.
   We found bigger subpopulations in matrix habitat ponds and a higher
   percentage of individuals moving among them when compared to continuous
   forest ponds. Constant movement of individuals among disturbed
   subpopulations decreases population isolation and increases
   interbreeding among different subpopulations. No movement between
   individuals from continuous forest ponds and disturbed habitats was
   observed. This suggests that the disturbed habitat subpopulations are
   not acting as sink subpopulations for continuous forest populations. The
   maintenance of individuals in fragments is more dependent on local
   conditions for reproduction and on subpopulations in the matrix habitat
   than on recruitment of individuals from populations in continuous
   forest. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The soil seed bank can be an important source for vegetation
   regeneration, and data on the similarity between aboveground vegetation
   and the seed bank can provide information about successional pathways
   after disturbances or land-use change. We conducted this study in
   natural grasslands in the subtropical highland region in southern
   Brazil. We evaluated the effect of silviculture on richness, density,
   and composition of the seed bank at former grassland sites converted to
   pine plantations 25 years ago. We worked at six grassland sites and
   three pine plantation sites and used the seedling emergence method. Seed
   bank density and richness in grasslands were lower than those reported
   in similar environments in other regions. Species richness and density
   varied considerably within each vegetation type; therefore, richness and
   density were not statistically significant, while composition varied
   among vegetation types. In terms of species, the pine plantation seed
   bank was a small subset of the grassland seed bank. Seeds of typical
   grassland species were missing in the pine plantation, but also had only
   low abundances in the grassland, and similarity of seed bank and
   vegetation were low (less than 20\%). The low seed density found in this
   study, including in grasslands areas, indicates that regeneration of
   species from the soil seed bank likely is of a limited role for the
   maintenance of plant populations after disturbances in this system. Our
   data further suggest that natural regeneration after tree planting in
   grasslands is reduced due to seed limitation.

Abstract = {In the Cerrado of Brazil, the largest Neotropical savanna region, open
   habitats are suffering an intense process of conversion to pasture and
   agricultural land. This study evaluated the responses of birds to the
   thinning of tree and shrub cover in plots of cerrado sensu stricto, the
   dominant habitat in the region, and examined whether disturbed plots
   supported bird communities of open natural habitats with similar
   structure. Birds were censused by point counts in five disturbed sites
   and in seven preserved patches, with a total of 304 samples of 20
   minutes in 68 points. Cleared plots were not suitable for species
   strongly dependent on trees and shrubs, such as frugivores and most
   insectivores. Their abundance was associated with the complexity of
   vegetation structure in these plots. Shrubby pastures held about 120\%
   more species than the traditional cleared ones. Bird communities of
   pastures showed large differences in relation to those of grasslands
   with similar structure. Communities of pastures were dominated by a
   seedeater, the Blue-black Grassquit Volatinia jacarina, and most species
   were habitat generalist or oportunistic predators, such as raptors and
   insectivores. Obligate grassland species, like the Grass Wren
   Cistothorus platensis, Cock-tailed Tyrant Alectrurus tricolor and
   Black-masked Finch Coryphaspiza melanotis, as well as other abundant
   species in grasslands, such as Sharp-tailed Grass-tyrant Culicivora
   caudacuta and Capped Seedeater Sporophila bouvreuil do not adapt to
   pastures. Grassland grasses probably do not recover spontaneously in
   abandoned pastures and in other agricultural lands. Thus, conservation
   of grassland birds will strongly depend on a urgent programme of
   identification and protection of large areas of Cerrado dominated by
   campo limpo and campo sujo. These species would also benefit from the
   maintenance of a band of grassland along gallery forests.},

Abstract = {Glacial-aged vegetation dynamics of the Humaita-Western Brazilian
   Amazonia were studied by pollen, sedimentary facies, C-14 dating, delta
   C-13(org) and C/N-molar. Two sediment cores were taken to a depth of 10
   and 8 m from areas covered by grassland and dense/open forest,
   respectively. The deposits represent a succession of sediment
   accumulation in active channel (>42,600 cal yr B.P.), abandoned
   channel/floodplain (>42,600 to similar to 39,000 cal yr B.P.), and oxbow
   lake sedimentary environments (similar to 39,000 cal yr B.P. to modern).
   The predominance of mud sediments, depletion of delta C-13(org) and
   decrease in C/N-molar values identify the lake establishment. In these
   settings, low energy subaqueous conditions were developed, locally
   favoring preservation of a pollen assemblage representing herbaceous
   vegetation, some modern taxa from Amazonia and cold-adapted plants from
   the Andes represented by Alnus (2-11\%), Hedyosmum (2-17\%), Weinmannia
   (0-18\%), Podocarpus (0-4\%), Ilex (0-4\%) and Drymis (0-1\%), at least
   between >42,600 and <35,200 cal yr B.P. The herbs and modern taxa from
   Amazonia persisted through the Holocene, while the cold pollen
   assemblage became absent. The co-occurrence of Alnus with other cold
   adapted plants from the Andes during the late Pleistocene indicates that
   Alnus probably penetrated the Western Amazonia lowland or was growing
   closer to the study site due to cooler temperatures during glacial
   times. The present study presents the first report of a glacial age
   forest containing Alnus in areas of the Brazilian Amazonian lowlands. In
   addition to its palaeogeographical importance, this work demonstrates
   the effectiveness of using a combination of proxies for reconstructing
   sedimentary environments associated with vegetation. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Title = {Liana and vine germination requirements in a subtropical forest zone},
Journal = {FLORA},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {297},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Climbing plants may be classified as lianas (woody) or vines
   (herbaceous). This grouping is not taxonomic but is useful for
   functional ecology. We evaluated seed germination of three liana and
   four vine species from the Chinese subtropical forest zone. Seeds were
   collected from different environments (abandoned agricultural land,
   broadleaf forest, coniferous mixed forest) and seed traits characterized
   (seed fresh mass, seed shape index, water gain). Germination tests were
   conducted under different temperature regimes: 5/10, 10/20, 20/30,
   25/35, 35/ 40 degrees C under light and dark conditions. Additionally,
   we tested the relationships of germination responses (germination
   percentage, mean germination times, and relative light-germination
   index) with seed traits. The two species from abandoned agricultural
   land (Glycine max subsp. soja and Ipomoea triloba) had impermeable seed
   coats and reached only intermediate values of germination percentage,
   from 20 to 40\% in the tested temperatures, with little effect from
   light regimes. In the broadleaf forest, Ipomoea nil also had impermeable
   seeds, but reached 91\% of germination under 25/35 degrees C. Seeds of
   I. nil were the largest ones (4.8 g per 100 seeds), and there was a
   positive relationship of seed mass with G\%. Seeds of Kadsura
   longipedunculata (liana) had low G\% under all tested temperatures,
   probably related to some dormancy type, which requires further
   investigation. Species from coniferous mixed forest were greatly
   affected by temperature regimes, and Coptosapelta diffusa (the smallest
   seeds) had also the most light-dependent germination. Light-germination
   index had thus a significant/ negative relationship with seeds mass.
   Environmental factors may help to explain the distribution of seed
   traits in our study, but further research should examine a larger set of
   species to better understand regeneration ecology of climbing plants in
   contrasting ecosystems.},

Abstract = {Background Mining activities have environmental impacts due to sediment
   movement and contamination of areas and may also pose risks to people's
   food security. In Brazil, the majority of coal mining activities are in
   the south, in the Santa Catarina carboniferous region. In this region,
   previously mined areas contaminated with heavy metals frequently occur
   nearby inhabited zones. Mining is part of the daily lives of local
   communities, and its environmental impacts are visible in the landscape;
   however, plants with medicinal and food use from these areas can be
   still consumed. Heavy metals are contaminants that do not have odor,
   color, or taste, and are therefore difficult to detect. We aimed to
   verify whether people use plants from contaminated mine areas, and
   understand which factors can influence the use of these resources, even
   from areas visibly impacted. Methods We conducted 195 semi-structured
   interviews with residents from 14 areas nearby abandoned mines in the
   main municipalities of the Santa Catarina carboniferous region. We asked
   each interviewee about the length of time they lived in the region,
   their perception of the quality of the environment, and what plant
   species were used and for what purpose. We constructed generalized
   multivariate linear models to verify which variables can affect the
   group of species mentioned and generalized linear models to verify which
   variables can affect the total number of citations. We estimated the
   frequency of citing species collected using the Smith index. Results
   From all interviewees, 127 (65\%) reported collecting plants for
   medicinal and food use, directly from contaminated mine areas. Long-term
   residents, as well as those who noticed more environmental changes
   (positive and negative), cited more plants used and had more detailed
   knowledge of plant use in their communities. When asked if they were
   aware of the possible contamination of mined areas, 85\% said they knew
   about it. However, only 10\% associated negative health effects with the
   use of plant species collected in contaminated mined areas. Conclusions
   Our study demonstrates that people living nearby contaminated areas use
   and consume locally sourced plants, e.g., people know little about the
   danger of this contamination in their food and the risk of these
   contaminants to their health. These results also reveal a lack of
   information about contamination, as well as a lack of actions that
   include local communities in contaminated area restoration strategies.
   This situation poses a risk to the food security of the people living
   nearby former coal mining areas.},

Abstract = {Conceptual confusion revolves around how to define, assess, and overcome
   land, ecosystem, and landscape degradation. Common elements link
   degradation and recovery processes, offering ways to advance local,
   regional, and global initiatives to reduce degradation and promote the
   recovery of ecosystems and landscapes in forest biomes. Biophysical
   attributes of degradation and recovery can be measured, but the
   relevance of selected attributes across scales is subject to values that
   determine preferred states. Degradation defined in the context of a
   resilience-based approach is a state where the capacity for regeneration
   is greatly reduced or lost, recovery is arrested, core interactions and
   feedbacks are broken, and human intervention is required to initiate a
   trajectory of recovery. Another approach combines degradation and
   recovery processes through the concept of recovery debt, the cumulative
   lost benefits incurred, relative to a target state during phases of
   degradation and recovery. Degradation and recovery can also be described
   in terms of societal willingness to invest in improved management or
   restoration. Interventions can facilitate recovery to new stable or
   persistent states that provide multiple social and ecological benefits
   at land, ecosystem, and landscape scales. Multiple trajectories of
   recovery, as well as historic and ongoing chronic environmental change,
   might, however, mean that recovery to an original reference state is not
   possible.},

Abstract = {The spatial distribution and growth of human populations have been
   overlooked by current debates concerning the impact of rural-urban
   migration for forest conservation in tropical countries. We investigated
   human settlement and population change in the Brazilian Amazon,
   combining government census data with field surveys along rivers. Rural
   populations were clustered and growing within 300 km of urban centers,
   whereas depopulation and land abandonment dominated farther from towns.
   The permanently inhabited extent of rivers contracted by 33 +/- 8 SE\%
   in recent decades, and households farther upriver were more likely to be
   considering rural-urban migration. However, harvesting of aquatic and
   terrestrial wildlife by nonresidents continued into headwater regions,
   hundreds of kilometers beyond the last household on any given river.
   Policy makers should consider that expanding cities may drive
   deforestation and overexploitation near towns while unclear property
   rights threatens overharvesting and unregulated land speculation in
   abandoned headwaters.},

Abstract = {Artificial perches can provide an important supply of seeds and

   the effectiveness of artificial perches for the dispersal of seeds in an
   area of the southwest Brazilian Amazon. We conducted the study on the

   March 2017. We installed seed traps with artificial perches and control
   traps at different distances from the adjacent forest. We collected
   19,865 seeds in boxes under the artificial perches and 1300 in the
   control traps. There was greater richness of plant species and abundance
   of seeds in the boxes under the artificial perches when compared with
   the control traps. The artificial perches at a distance of 40 m from the
   adjacent forest presented a greater species richness and distinct
   composition of plants. The quantity of dispersed seeds did not correlate
   with precipitation, although there was a correlation between rainfall
   and the fresh seed mass. The artificial perches were efficient at
   dispersing seeds and are a low-cost technique that can be used as a
   strategy for the regeneration of forests in degraded areas.},

   hypoxerophytic Caatinga fragment in the city of Arcoverde, Pernambuco
   state and aimed at determining the floristic composition and
   phytosociological parameters of tree and shrub species that make up the
   fragment. The study was conducted in 40 plots (10 x 25 m) with inclusion
   level the circumference at 1.3 m above the ground with CAP >= 10 cm. The
   absolute and relative density, absolute and relative frequency, absolute
   and relative dominance and importance value were evaluated; species
   diversity was given by index of Shannon-Weaver (H') and equality of
   Pielou evenness, determining the hypsometric distribution at one meter
   intervals and diameter distribution at 3 cm intervals. In the floristic
   survey of adults, 1,491 individuals were found alive, distributed in 36
   woody tree and shrub species, 19 families and 31 genera. Families that
   stood out most were Mimosaceae, Euphorbiaceae, Anacardiaceae,
   Caesalpiniaceae and Rhamnaceae. The diversity index of Shannon-Weaver
   was 2.05 nats/ind. and equality of Pielou evenness was 0.57. For the
   seven phytosociological parameters evaluated, the species that stood out
   were Mimosa ophthalmocentra, Poincianella pyramidalis, Senegalia

Abstract = {Land-use change in tropical dry forests can dramatically alter soil
   properties, but little is known about their resilience. We assessed soil
   resilience by examining resistance to, as well as recovery from, pasture
   use by smallholder farmers in western Mexico. We measured 25 soil and
   vegetation properties and compared old-growth forest (OGF) sites and
   pastures to evaluate resistance to pasture use. We assessed whether
   those properties recovered to OGF reference values after pasture
   abandonment by analyzing the trajectories of properties along a
   chronosequence of secondary vegetation. Finally, we assessed whether
   recovery of soil properties could be inferred from the recovery of
   vegetation properties. Nine out of 25 properties differed significantly
   between the OGF sites and pastures. From these nine nonresistant
   properties, six (i.e., penetration resistance, soil C concentration,
   soil C/N, basal area, individual density, rarefied species richness of
   woody vegetation) showed recovery as a significant positive relationship
   with forest age. In contrast, surface litter C, litter C/N, and soil
   available P showed no resistance and no recovery within the successional
   period examined (up to 35 y). The best vegetation indicator for the
   recovery of some soil properties was woody species richness. This may
   suggest that functional differences of colonizing plants matter for
   recovery after pasture use. Our findings indicate that soil was overall
   resilient to pasture use, but some properties did not recover
   synchronously with vegetation properties during succession. Thus, more
   attention should be paid to soil function, because full ecosystem
   recovery is often inferred from the recovery of vegetation properties.

   Analysis in Discrete Time},
Journal = {FORESTS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {13},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Background: The commonly used methods for the financial evaluation of
   plantation forest investment projects do not incorporate uncertainties
   and ignore the value related to flexibility. The real options analysis
   makes it possible to capture these values in investment projects,
   increasing their value and return. Despite this, studies involving real
   options in forest investment projects are scarce, specifically those
   related to Pinus spp. Therefore, this study aimed to: (a) analyze
   whether the real options analysis adds value to investment projects of
   Pinus elliottii Engelm. plantations; and (b) make the real options
   analysis more accessible to forest managers and potentially increase its
   use in the investment projects of Pinus spp. plantations. Methods: We
   evaluated two investment projects in P. elliottii plantations in
   southern Brazil, which differed in the way of obtaining the land for
   planting: with lease or purchase of land on a planning horizon of 21
   years. In the real options analysis, we used deferral, expansion, and
   abandonment. Results: Individually, the deferral, expansion, and
   abandonment options add value to investment projects in Pinus elliottii
   plantations. The option to expand the forested area is one that adds the
   most value to the investment project with land lease. In the investment
   project with land purchase, it is abandonment. Conclusions: Investment
   projects in Pinus elliotti plantations that contemplate the land
   purchase analyzed through the real options analysis present higher
   financial returns than those that consider land lease, inverting the
   result provided by the traditional analysis.},

Abstract = {Assessing variations in tree allometry is useful for understanding
   height growth strategies in relation to life-history trajectories, light
   competition and environmental restrictions. Scaling exponent and
   asymptotic heights obtained from height-diameter (HD) models may
   elucidate how trees optimise growth strategies and the potential drivers
   that influence tree height. Our main objective was to explore how the HD
   relationship in Bracatinga (Mimosa scabrella) varies along stands
   chronosequence and life history. The study was carried out in
   discontinuous stands located across the metropolitan region of Curitiba,
   southern Brazil. We used HD data from 300 temporary plots in
   chronosequences dating from a disturbance, which represented stand
   development after intervention, covering the life history of the
   species. Power and exponential models were fitted to data to describe
   the HD relationship over time. Mixed-effects models were applied to
   explain the height variations by stand characteristics. We found that
   tree height and allometry were influenced by stand development phase and
   tree life stage along the chronosequence. Changes in tree height were
   also driven by light competition related to certain stand
   characteristics, such as basal area, stem density and species diversity.
   We concluded that growth strategies are conditioned by interactions
   between light requirements along a tree's life history and successional
   stand evolution. The results revealed that gradual changes in tree
   development might be recognised by stationary data along
   chronosequences. Quantifying changes in HD allometry has ecological and
   practical applications for explaining the strategies and drivers
   underpinning tree growth and providing useful knowledge for improving
   growing stock predictions and stand management.},

Abstract = {The Pale-bellied Tyrant-manakin (Neopelma pallescens) inhabits
   semi-deciduous and riparian forests in central-north South America.
   Contrary to most manakins, there is no evident sexual dichromatism in
   the species and little is known about its breeding biology. We studied
   the breeding biology of a colour-banded population of the species from
   August to December 2016 and from August to October 2017 in the Campus
   Florestal of the Universidade Federal de Vicosa, south-eastern Brazil.
   The breeding season extended from early September to late November. The
   species is promiscuous, with males exhibiting simple courtship displays
   (exploded leks) in individual arenas. The nest (n=13) is a cup attached
   by its top lip between forked branches and is very simple, with a
   structural layer made with dry grass stems and heads, attached to the
   branch with spider silk. The outer and lining layers are absent. The
   mean clutch size was 1.8 eggs (n=11), which are oval and pale coloured,
   covered with spots of different shades of brown, often concentrated in
   the larger pole. Mean egg length and width (+/- SD) were 21.0 +/-
   0.9x15.8 +/- 0.7mm (n=14) and the mean weight was 2.8 +/- 0.4g (n=10).
   The incubation period could not be estimated, but the nestling period
   was 15days (n=2). The simple percentage of successful nests was 15.4\%,
   with 76.9\% of the nests depredated and 7.7\% abandoned. This is the
   first detailed study about the breeding biology of any Neopelma species,
   providing relevant data for the study of the evolution of life history
   strategies not only for the genus, but for the whole family Pipridae.},

Abstract = {This work performs an analysis of the spatial pattern of the coffee

   relate changes in land cover and land use with the coffee land
   abandonment, geographically weighted regressions (GWR) were adopted with
   the rates of change in forest and pasture cover, and also with changes
   in the size of the cattle herd. The coffee-crop area evolution
   identifies three behaviors: the concentration of planted area in the
   northwest, with constant growth after the 1990s; a remaining area in the
   mountainous region; and the abandonment of coffee farms in the south.
   Although bivariate models can't explain the changes in land cover and
   land use, geographically weighted regressions point to a trend of
   replacing coffee cover with pasturelands in the south region of the
   state, while eventual changes for forest cover are more likely in other

Abstract = {This study aimed to know the effective dispersal distance of Cabralea
   canjerana (Vell.) Mart. in a forest fragment. Plots of 5 x 5 m were
   allocated in an area with high density of regenerating individuals of
   the species. Individuals higher than 30 cm and with diameter at breast
   height (DBH) smaller than 15 cm were recorded and referenced in
   pseudo-coordinates. Individuals with DBH greater than 15 cm were
   considered as seed producers. The dispersal distance was calculated
   using the methodology by Nathan \& Muller-Landau (2000); two distances
   were calculated: the distance of each individual in relation to the
   nearest adult tree, and the average distance between all matrix trees.
   The effective dispersal peak occurs at a mean distance of 30 meters from
   the mother trees. Three seed producing individuals per hectare are
   needed to ensure the continuous regeneration of the species.},

Title = {Fruit traits of pioneer trees structure seed dispersal across distances
   on tropical deforested landscapes: Implications for restoration},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {57},

Pages = {2329-2339},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {1. Pioneer trees with fleshy fruits are typically planted in restoration
   projects to attract frugivores as a mean to increase dispersal and
   accelerate forest regeneration. However, differences in fruit traits of
   pioneer trees can potentially influence dispersal and their restoration
   outcomes.
   2. Here we investigated the effects of bird and plant traits, and
   distance to forest fragments, on the seed rain using a tree-planting
   experiment replicated in 12 deforested sites in Brazil. Factors were
   fruit traits of pioneer trees (wind-dispersed, bird-dispersed with
   lipids or with carbohydrates and controls) and distance (10, 50, 300 m)
   from forest fragments.
   3. We found that density and richness of birds and seeds decreased
   exponentially with distance from fragments, yet these effects were minor
   compared to the effects of fruit traits on the structure of the seed
   rain.
   4. Overall, plots with fleshy fruited pioneers attracted much greater
   bird activity and seed dispersal than plots with wind-dispersal pioneers
   and the controls. For instance, plots with carbohydrate-rich fruits
   received more than twice the average species richness and density of
   birds and seeds of plots with lipid-rich pioneer trees, surpassing
   wind-dispersed pioneers by more than 80\%, and controls by over 90\%.
   Furthermore, the fruit trait treatments resulted in morphological shifts
   in the average traits of visiting birds. Significant differences in bill
   gape and flight capacities (wing-loading) were associated with the
   differences in the seed rain associated with each treatment.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Understanding how trait-matching
   processes mediating mutualistic seed dispersal by frugivores interact
   with distance-dependent dispersal limitation on deforested tropical
   landscapes is critical for improving forest restoration efforts. This is
   especially relevant in the context of applied nucleation. As shown here,
   avian seed dispersal can thus be manipulated in restoration projects in
   order to increase connectivity and speed up forest recovery and the
   provision of the multiple ecosystem services that follow forest
   succession.},

   surveys. Data were collected using a non-destructive method and the
   animals were identified by order and separated by taxonomic units.
   Twenty-three fauna orders were found, with the most frequent being
   Anura, Araneae, Hymenoptera and Isoptera. There was an increase in the
   number of taxonomic units found in each survey, with a significant
   difference after ten months of installation. The results indicate that
   the brushwood was attractive to the fauna and provided new habitats and
   coexistence between different fauna groups during the monitored period.},

Abstract = {Plantations are frequently established on abandoned pasture lands to
   speed forest recovery. This strategy requires matching a tree species
   mix with the prevailing microenvironmental conditions. In four degraded
   pastures of the Mexican Lacandon rainforest, we planted 2,400 trees of 6
   species (Guazuma ulmifolia, Inga vera, Ochroma pyramidale, Trichospermum
   mexicanum, Bursera simaruba, and Spondias mombin) to (1) test survival,
   initial growth, and establishment costs; (2) evaluate whether vegetative
   cuttings outperform direct seeding or transplants of nursery-raised
   seedlings; (3) determine tree response to herbaceous dominance and soil
   compaction; and (4) scrutinize the results' consistency across sites and
   sampling scales of tree-microenvironment interactions (individual tree
   vs. averaged plot responses). After 2 years, overall survival and growth
   rates were high for 2 of 3 nursery-raised species. Contrary to
   expectations, all seedlings outperformed the cuttings while direct
   seeding resulted in a cost-effective option of intermediate efficacy.
   The impact of soil resistance to root penetration on tree biomass
   accumulation was species dependent while bulk density was not relevant.
   Soil-covering, herbaceous vegetation accelerated growth in 3 of 4 tested
   species during the dry season. At this initial stage of forest
   restoration in abandoned pastures, Guazuma and Trichospermum were the
   most restoration-effective species. Costs can be reduced by using
   direct-seeding Inga and avoiding weeding during the dry season. Finally,
   our results demonstrate how species selection trials can be misleading
   due to site variations in tree response and to sampling scales that fail
   to account for small-scale environmental heterogeneity. We recommend
   ways to improve the design of restoration trials.},

Year = {2023},
Volume = {82},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Pinus plantation forestry in South America has expanded quickly and
   assumed a significant portion of land use, including in urban
   arborization. This invasive alien genus changes the plant community,
   resulting in a loss of biodiversity, and environmental issues that
   require public policy actions. Here, we applied dendrochronology to
   assess ecological growth dynamics and micro and macro scale climate
   effects on an abandoned Pinus elliottii trees in urban forest fragments,
   and provide insights into the management for public policies. We
   constructed a robust 41-year (1978 - 2019) chronology that showed r =
   0.63, rbar = 0.47, and EPS = 0.92 with an average annual growth rate of
   7.10 mm/year. Modeling tree growth of diameter, height and volume of P.
   elliottii based on tree-ring analysis, we assessed the average diameter
   without bark (42.37 cm) and height (19 m). The growth rates in the early
   years evidence pioneer behavior, representing rapid sexual maturity. The
   volume growth model indicates an average individual volume of 1.23 m(3)
   , with maximum productivity at 16 years when the current annual volume
   increment peaks. This age corresponds to a diameter of 32 cm, which
   would be an appropriate minimum logging diameter to wood destined for a
   sawmill. Volumetric increment rates highlight the potential trade-in
   forestry sector and application in public policies that aim to control
   and manage P. elliotti. We evidence significant climatic signals, but
   with moderate influence on the variability of growth. For the local
   climatic variables, there was a positive influence of warm and humid
   summer and late spring, during the previous and current growth seasons.
   Furthermore, considering global climatic factors, there was only a
   positive influence of the Annual Southern Oscillation Index for June,
   representing a positive correlation for dry and cold early winter,
   influenced by La Ni (n) over tildea events. This work provides an
   understanding of the biological growth of P. elliotti in urban forest
   fragments and opens a perspective to assist public policies in managing
   the invasion of Pinus spp. linked to the forest trade.},

Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {14},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Mapping plant species at the regional scale to provide information for
   ecologists and forest managers is a challenge for the remote sensing
   community. Here, we use a deep learning algorithm called U-net and very
   high-resolution multispectral images (0.5 m) from GeoEye satellite to
   identify, segment and map canopy palms over similar to 3000 km(2) of
   Amazonian forest. The map was used to analyse the spatial distribution
   of canopy palm trees and its relation to human disturbance and edaphic
   conditions. The overall accuracy of the map was 95.5\% and the F1-score
   was 0.7. Canopy palm trees covered 6.4\% of the forest canopy and were
   distributed in more than two million patches that can represent one or
   more individuals. The density of canopy palms is affected by human
   disturbance. The post-disturbance density in secondary forests seems to
   be related to the type of disturbance, being higher in abandoned pasture
   areas and lower in forests that have been cut once and abandoned.
   Additionally, analysis of palm trees' distribution shows that their
   abundance is controlled naturally by local soil water content, avoiding
   both flooded and waterlogged areas near rivers and dry areas on the top
   of the hills. They show two preferential habitats, in the low elevation
   above the large rivers, and in the slope directly below the hill tops.
   Overall, their distribution over the region indicates a relatively
   pristine landscape, albeit within a forest that is critically endangered
   because of its location between two deforestation fronts and because of
   illegal cutting. New tree species distribution data, such as the map of
   all adult canopy palms produced in this work, are urgently needed to
   support Amazon species inventory and to understand their distribution
   and diversity.},

   flexibilities of deferral, expansion of 30.0\% of the energy production
   capacity, and the project's abandonment were inserted into the binomial
   model of the decision tree, built in discrete time. The project's

Abstract = {The spatial and temporal pattern of annual rainfall and the strength of
   the dry season within the Amazon region are poorly known. Existing
   rainfall maps are based on the data from full-scale, long-term
   meteorological stations, operated by national organizations linked to
   the World Meteor- ological Organisation, such as INMET in Brazil.
   Stations with 30 or more years of uninterrupted and reliable recordings
   are very few, considering the size of the region, and most of them are
   located along the major rivers. It has been suggested that rainfall
   conditions away from these rivers are substantially different. An
   analysis has been made of the records of a network of simple
   pluviometric sites in the Brazilian part of the region as maintained by
   the National Agency for Electric Energy (ANEEL) since 1970. The latter
   data sets were used to draw more detailed maps on annual rainfall, and
   on the strength of the dry season in particular; average number of
   consecutive months with less than 100 mm, 50 mm, and 10 mm,
   respectively. Also, some data were obtained on the spatial expression of
   El Nino events within the region. Subregional differences are large, and
   it is argued that they are important for the success or failure of
   agricultural settlements; for the hazard of large-scale fire damage of
   the still existing primary forest vegetation; for the functioning of
   this land cover as stock and sink Of CO2, and for the likelihood that
   secondary forests on abandoned agricultural lands will have less
   biomass. The effects of past El Nino rainfall anomalies on the
   biodiversity of the natural savannahs within the forest region are

Abstract = {Understanding how different components of species diversity of
   regenerating areas respond to both time of abandonment and landscape
   metrics may offer crucial information for both theoretical and practical
   purposes. Using 15 regeneration areas (from 4 to 30 years) and nine
   areas of mature forest, we assessed how tree seedling assemblage
   responds to time of abandonment and forest cover in terms of species
   diversity and taxonomic composition. We found that species diversity of
   seedlings responded positively to time of abandonment, but was not
   influence by forest cover. Diversity of rare and common species (D-0 and
   D-1, respectively) but not dominant species (D-2) increased with time of
   abandonment, reaching reference values very quickly (ca. 20 years).
   However, species composition seemed to respond to both ageing of forest
   stand and landscape structure represented by forest cover. Our findings
   reinforce that in human-dominated landscapes, local processes related to
   recovery with time should be more important for plant community assembly
   than landscape structure, leading to a number of possibilities for
   multiple successional pathways. in Portuguese is available with online

Abstract = {Organic matter plays an important role in many soil properties, and for
   that reason it is necessary to identify management systems which
   maintain or increase its concentrations. The aim of the present study
   was to determine the quality and quantity of organic C in different
   compartments of the soil fraction in different Amazonian ecosystems. The
   soil organic matter (FSOM) was fractionated and soil C stocks were
   estimated in primary forest (PF), pasture (P), secondary succession (SS)
   and an agroforestry system (AFS). Samples were collected at the depths
   0-5, 5-10, 10-20, 20-40, 40-60, 60-80, 80-100, 100-160, and 160-200 cm.
   Densimetric and particle size analysis methods were used for FSOM,
   obtaining the following fractions: FLF (free light fraction), IALF
   (intra-aggregate light fraction), F-sand (sand fraction), F-clay (clay
   fraction) and F-silt (silt fraction). The 0-5 cm layer contains 60 \% of
   soil C, which is associated with the FLF. The F-clay was responsible for
   70 \% of C retained in the 0-200 cm depth. There was a 12.7 g kg(-1) C
   gain in the FLF from PF to SS, and a 4.4 g kg(-1) C gain from PF to AFS,
   showing that SS and AFS areas recover soil organic C, constituting
   feasible C-recovery alternatives for degraded and intensively farmed
   soils in Amazonia. The greatest total stocks of carbon in soil fractions
   were, in decreasing order: (101.3 Mg ha(-1) of C -AFS) > (98.4 Mg ha(-1)
   of C - FP) > (92.9 Mg ha(-1) of C -SS) > (64.0 Mg ha(-1) of C - P). The
   forms of land use in the Amazon influence C distribution in soil
   fractions, resulting in short- or long-term changes.},

Abstract = {Ecological knowledge plays a significant role in ensuring efficient
   ecological restoration. We conducted a systematic review to assess if
   sufficient ecological knowledge has been accumulated to aid restoration
   practices for the Cerrado, a Brazilian biome dominated by savanna
   ecosystems and threatened by anthropogenic disturbances. Most Cerrado
   restoration studies were performed by few research groups and focused
   primarily on two vegetation types: cerrado sensu stricto (typical
   savanna) and riparian forest. We also found that defining reference
   ecosystems and selecting plant species for restoration programs is
   neglected, mostly disregarding their original occurrence and proportion
   of plant growth forms. Furthermore, studies lacked standardized and
   systematic evaluation of restoration outcomes. Hence, we argue that
   current ecological knowledge is insufficient to guarantee the success of
   large-scale ecological restoration of the Cerrado. We strengthen the
   need to explicitly define the reference ecosystem for each Cerrado
   ecosystem and use its structure and composition as guidance for
   ecological restoration research, which should be based on a scientific
   approach. We encourage investigations into ecological dynamics and
   natural regeneration of the different vegetation types of the Cerrado
   and highlight the importance of integrating such knowledge with
   environmental laws, societal engagement and cost-effective techniques to
   advance Cerrado ecological restoration.},

Volume = {102},

Abstract = {The development of easily observable measures of restoration success is
   essential for monitoring of the ambitious proposed global restoration
   targets (e.g. The Bonn Challenge; New York Declaration on Forests).
   Systematic reviews with meta-analyses are a good way to evaluate the
   performance of different organisms in the monitoring of ecological
   restoration. Among the arthropods, ants have a long history in
   environmental monitoring. We compiled a data set and performed a global
   meta-analysis encompassing studies conducted in different ecosystems
   around the world to investigate whether richness and composition of
   species or functional groups (FG) of ant communities can be predicted
   during the restoration process. Moreover, we aimed to understand the
   influence of restoration technique (natural regeneration or active
   restoration), ecosystem type (temperate or tropical), and past land use
   (mining or pasture) on ant communities in areas undergoing restoration
   processes. Notwithstanding the varied conditions in which the studies
   were carried out, our meta-analysis showed that reestablishment of ant
   FG takes place more quickly than species richness. The recovery of ant
   diversity is faster in tropical ecosystems and areas under natural
   regeneration can have higher ant diversity than the reference areas. In
   temperate ecosystems, mined areas under restoration are less likely to
   recover the number of species than FG richness. Both species and FG
   composition were less predictable in our meta-analysis. As the
   publication of new datasets is increasing, we hope that future
   meta-analyses can build on the present study to further describe and
   understand the patterns in ant communities to be used as indicators of
   ecosystem restoration.},

Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2022},

Abstract = {The Madeira River Settlement at Rondonia state is one of the various
   Federal projects in the Legal Amazon created by the National Institute
   for Colonization and Agrarian Reform (INCRA). Over the years, fire
   practices such as slash-and-burn agriculture in the Legal Amazon have
   been con-verting the remained forest into pastures and croplands.
   According to the Brazilian New Forest Code, the rural environmental
   registry (CAR) became mandatory for monitoring the land occupations,
   aiming at maintaining forests and legal reserves preserved. The study
   goal was to analyze socioenvironmental aspects of the land-use and
   land-cover (LULC) dynamic at Madeira River settlement and its
   surroundings before and after the registry implementation, between July
   2008 and July 2018. Thematic classes and altimetry were overlaid using
   algebraic operators to create a zoning model with 21 zoning classes. The
   highest reduction in forested areas was observed in zone six, between
   SRTM heights of 90 and 100 m, with a forest loss of 1684 ha and forest
   gain of 638 ha. Transition map results showed the most forest conversion
   into secondary vegetation of 57.29 km(2) in ten years (2008-2018). The
   occupation increased at zones 11 and 12, showing the movement of
   settlers into the rainforest, with higher altimetry. The remained
   settlement lots located at low altimetry in the permanent protection
   area (PPA) are subject to the risk of flooding. The results also showed
   that the correlation between lot size and deforestation was not
   significant, suggesting that a set of social and environmental driver
   variables may be responsible for both losses and gains in the vegetated
   area in each lot. Family farming needs assistance for sustainable food
   production and to avoid soil degradation and abandonment, with an
   integrated effort of institutions, government and society. The
   manuscript serves as a regional case study that provides a relevant
   issue related to public policies concerning Legal Amazonian settlements
   occupation and deforestation, which may support the monitoring and
   controlling actions in the region.},

Abstract = {The largest continuous tropical forest is found in Amazonia. Its
   destruction by burning for cattle pastures and subsistence agriculture
   contributes to the increases in concentrations of CO2 in the atmosphere
   and at the same time exhausts the extraordinary biodiversity of this
   region. In this sense, global ecological problems such as the green
   house effect and genetic erosion and the future modes of development in
   Amazonia represent the same side of a coin. This means that the
   elaboration and implementation of strategies that understand the value
   of joint implementation as an indispensable element to reverse the
   tendencies of devastation which are underway in the regional contest are
   required. It is important to emphasize that in the same way that the
   dynamics of these tendencies have been driven both by the highly
   industrialized nations and by those which form part of the Amazon Basin,
   overcoming them demands united efforts of cooperation.
   It is from this principle that the Program Poverty and Environment in
   Amazonia, of the Federal University of Para has been working since its
   creation in 1992, considering that its actions - put into place with the
   support of international partners from the private sector as well as the
   civil society - are aimed toward the recuperation of degraded areas
   through the planting of agroforestry systems and the processing of
   natural products. These products besides the advantage of being
   recyclable, will at the end of their productive life, liberate only the
   CO2 needed by the plant for its growth. Through this approach,
   encroachment on primary forest areas is avoided, while agroforestry
   systems restore degraded areas in a manner which mimics the natural
   regeneration of the forest, enriched with species which produce natural
   products with potential for industrial use.},

Abstract = {Questions
   Perching and nursing effects drive initial steps of forest expansion
   over grasslands. Nursing effect is obviously related to niche
   mechanisms, while perching effect is likely to result both from neutral
   and niche factors. This study assessed the effect of neutral and niche
   factors on species composition in sapling communities developing beneath
   isolated trees/shrubs (ITS) in grassland.
   Location
   A mosaic of Campos grassland and Araucaria forest in Sao Francisco de
   Paula, southern Brazil (29 degrees 28'S, 50 degrees 13'W).
   Methods
   We described sapling communities beneath 32 ITS using mean number of
   forest woody saplings of different species. We performed a stepwise
   canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) to select ITS traits that
   maximized the association with species composition. Then we evaluated
   the contribution of distance from seed source, ITS traits and
   distance-structured ITS traits on sapling community assembly using a
   variation partitioning method based on CCA and partial CCA.
   Results
   Sapling species composition was significantly explained by ITS traits
   (ITS dispersal mode, ITS growth form, crown area:ITS height ratio, crown
   area, ITS height and crown area:volume ratio). Distance from seed
   sources explained only a minor, non-significant fraction of sapling
   species composition. Distance-structured trait variation was negligible.
   Conclusions
   Sapling community assembly beneath ITS was mostly explained by niche
   factors related to both nursing and perching effects. Dispersal
   limitation explained only a small fraction of variation in species
   composition beneath ITS, suggesting that neutral-based perching effect
   had a minor role in community assembly.},

Abstract = {In recent years, the study of skid trail recovery processes has gained
   momentum. In this review, 121 studies on various aspects of skid trail
   recovery were evaluated to determine when, where, and how the dominant
   factors that influence the process of recuperation occur. These studies
   were located proportionally in the following forest biomes: temperate
   (60\%), tropical ( 31\%), and boreal (9\%). Research focused mainly on
   soil physical properties to ascertain if there had been evidence of
   recovery. The majority of studies of a decade or less after abandonment
   demonstrated that heavily used skid trails had not recovered. On the
   contrary, lightly used skid trails did present full recoveries over the
   same time span. Soil recovery tended to occur in medium- to
   coarse-textured soils in temperate and boreal forests. Considering all
   forest biomes, the impacts of compaction persisted at least two to five
   decades after logging operations. The impacts were evident in diminished
   tree heights and volumes from trees growing on skid trails. The last 50
   years of research indicates that skid trails, globally, do recover from
   compaction, albeit slowly.},

Title = {Land use intensity determines soil properties and biomass recovery after
   abandonment of agricultural land in an Amazonian biodiversity hotspot},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {801},
Month = {DEC 20},
Abstract = {There has been widespread clearance of tropical forests for agriculture,
   but in many cases the cultivation phase is only transient. The secondary
   forests recovering on these abandoned sites may contribute to mitigation
   of greenhouse gas emissions and protection of biodiversity, but the
   rates of recovery may be dependent on land-use intensity and changes in
   soil properties during cultivation. However fine-scale details on these
   changes are poorly known for many tropical forest locations. We
   quantified soil properties and recovery of woody biomass in 42 tropical
   forest fragments representing a chronosequence following two types of
   agricultural land-uses, and in 15 comparable reference old growth
   forests, between the Andes and the Amazon in Peru. Soil fertility,
   particularly base cation concentrations, responded negatively to
   increasing intensity of agricultural land-use, and either decreased or
   increased with time after abandonment dependent on prior land-use. The
   predicted mean recovery rate of woody biomass over the first 20 years
   following abandonment matched that predicted by a general model for the
   Neotropics, but recovery was three-fold higher on sites abandoned
   following traditional agriculture than on sites recovering from
   intensive agriculture. Estimated total biomass recovered to just above
   half that of reference old growth forests within 71 years. The inclusion
   of the biomass of lianas and smaller tree stems did not modify the
   apparent rate of ecosystem biomass recovery, however the proportion of
   the total biomass stored in small stems was greater following intensive
   than traditional agriculture, which suggests that patterns of stand
   structural development are sensitive to land-use history. We conclude
   that effects of historic land use on soil nutrient concentrations and
   their changes through time are required for a more complete
   interpretation of variation in biomass recovery rates at local scales.
   These results also highlight the critical importance of contemporary
   agricultural intensification for carbon storage in tropical forests. (c)

Abstract = {It is well-known that Amazon tropical forest soils contain high
   microbial biodiversity. However, anthropogenic actions of slash and
   burn, mainly for pasture establishment, induce profound changes in the
   well-balanced biogeochemical cycles. After a few years the grass yield
   usually declines, the pasture is abandoned and is transformed into a
   secondary vegetation called ``capoeira{''} or fallow. The aim of this
   study was to examine how the clearing of Amazon rainforest for pasture
   affects: (1) the diversity of the Bacteria domain evaluated by
   Polymerase Chain Reaction and Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis
   (PCR-DGGE), (2) microbial biomass and some soil chemical properties (pH,
   moisture, P, K, Ca, Mg, Al, H + Al, and BS), and (3) the influence of
   environmental variables on the genetic structure of bacterial community.
   In the pasture soil, total carbon (C) was between 30 to 42 \% higher
   than in the fallow, and almost 47 \% higher than in the forest soil over
   a year. The same pattern was observed for N. Microbial biomass in the
   pasture was about 38 and 26 \% higher than at fallow and forest sites,
   respectively, in the rainy season. DGGE profiling revealed a lower
   number of bands per area in the dry season, but differences in the
   structure of bacterial communities among sites were better defined than
   in the wet season. The bacterial DNA fingerprints in the forest were
   stronger related to Al content and the Cmic:Ctot and Nmic:Ntot ratios.
   For pasture and fallow sites, the structure of the Bacteria domain was
   more associated with pH, sum of bases, moisture, total C and N and the
   microbial biomass. In general microbial biomass in the soils was
   influenced by total C and N, which were associated with the Bacteria
   domain, since the bacterial community is a component and active fraction
   of the microbial biomass. Results show that the genetic composition of
   bacterial communities in Amazonian soils changed along the sequence
   forest-pasture-fallow.},

Abstract = {In the Central Amazon we investigated whether seedling performance
   (survival, and relative growth rates in height and leaf numbers) was
   affected by initial seedling size (height and leaf numbers) in habitats
   that varied in their degree of human disturbance: cattle pasture, young
   secondary forest, 1-ha forest fragment and old-growth forest.
   Additionally, effects of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR),
   litter standing crop (LSC) and insect herbivory were evaluated 12 mo
   after transplantation in seedlings from the native canopy trees
   Chrysophyllium pomifirum, Micropholis venulosa and Pouteria caimito.
   Seedling performance changed rank across the understorey environment
   depending on species. Seedlings of Chrysophyllum thrived in all
   conditions but under high PAR, Micropholis thrived only in intermediate
   light conditions, whereas Pouteria thrived under high PAR. Effects of
   initial seedling size, PAR and herbivory after 1 y were specific to
   species, whereas LSC had no effect on performance. Initially larger
   seedlings resulted in lower survival for Chrysophyllum and Pouteria.
   Herbivory affected seedling performance in all species. Negative effects
   of herbivory were intensified under low PAR. Overall, our results showed
   that, as seedlings, species of the same family and characteristic of
   old-growth forests respond differently to the environmental constraints
   present in contrasting human-disturbed conditions. Larger seedlings may
   not always present greater tolerance to physical and biotic mortality
   risks.},

Abstract = {In the years after the First World War, the British and Western
   Australian governments cooperated in a Group Settlement Scheme. Its aim
   was to bring groups of settlers from various locations in the United
   Kingdom to remote forested parts of the South West of Western Australia,
   and to supply them with tools, building materials and livestock with
   which they were to clear land and establish small farms. Successful
   settlers would then be granted ownership of the land that they had
   developed. The scheme met with limited success for a range of reasons
   including the challenging nature of the terrain and the vegetation, the
   unfamiliarity of the settlers with both farming and the local
   environment and the decline in economic opportunities resulting from the
   onset of the Great Depression. While many, if not most, settlers
   abandoned their farms within a relatively short period of time, some did
   develop successful dairy farms which have now been passed through
   several generations of family farmers for almost a century. Furthermore,
   many of the lots that were abandoned by the original Group Settlers
   during the depression have been reoccupied and redeveloped in recent
   decades as the scenic South West region has become a high amenity rural
   area characterised by growth in viticulture, tourism, retirement
   migration, hobby farming and telecommuting. This paper uses archival
   material to document the challenges and shortcomings of the original
   settlement scheme and will outline the subsequent development of some of
   the Group Settlement localities over the intervening decades. This
   experience is compared with the Nova Amazonia project, a modern day
   rural settlement scheme in a remote part of Brazil where the settlers
   have experienced challenges and difficulties comparable to those of the
   Group Settlers on an Australian frontier in the 1920s.},

Title = {Does selective logging affect litter deposition rates in central
   Brazilian Amazonia?},
Journal = {ANAIS DA ACADEMIA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIAS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {94},
Number = {3},
Abstract = {Selective logging is one of the main human activities that are
   drastically modifying tropical forests around the world. Reduced-impact
   logging emerged as a rational model of timber harvesting that reduces
   the impacts on the ecosystems and contributes to the conservation of
   natural resources. Nevertheless, this type of activity may still alter
   the forest structure, nutrient cycling, soil drainage, and other
   important ecosystem processes. Here, we aimed at testing the effects of
   selective logging on litter deposition in central Brazilian Amazonia. We
   estimated litter production during one dry and one rainy season in 11
   sites logged between 2003 and 2017 and one unlogged site. Mean litter
   deposition was greater during the dry season. Although litter deposition
   rates varied between a few study sites, this variation was independent
   of the time after logging. The results suggest that the low logging
   intensity in the study site (16.8 m(3)/ ha) had no intense impacts on
   litter deposition. Reduced-impact logging may be an alternative for the
   use of forest resources in Amazonian forests without compromising
   nutrient cycles.},

Abstract = {The objective of this study was to evaluate growth along the stem of
   Araucaria angustifolia (Bertol.) Kuntze trees competing in overstocked
   stands, in order to identify periods when growth and trunk shape are
   differentiated during the trees' lifespan. The research was carried out
   in a planted forest of Araucaria angustifolia established in 1946 in the
   Acungui National Forest in Campo Largo, Parana, Brazil, when these trees
   were 65 years old. One thinning was recorded, at some time between 1970
   and 1980. Forty-six trees were selected and divided into three
   development classes (DC) at 65 years of age; these classes considered
   diameter at 1.30 m (breast height, dbh) with a range of 20 cm (from 10
   cm to 70 cm). In addition to dbh, total tree height, and crown height
   and diameter were measured in the field. From each tree, 14 disks were
   removed to analyze growth rings and confirm the age of the stand. Some
   trees in the smallest DC (10 <= dbh < 30 cm) were the product of natural
   regeneration (younger trees that grew after the initial planting). In
   63\% of the trees, at least one growth ring was missing at breast
   height. Missing rings at breast height were more common in trees with
   smaller dbh and crown diameters. The need for more growing space was
   observed at different periods during the studied lifespan of the trees
   from three DCs. It resulted in changes in stems shape from conical to
   cylindrical. Different growth patterns could be observed during the
   lives of some trees as they outgrew their competition.},

Abstract = {Bamboo has been receiving increased attention as a renewable resource
   owing to its fast growth, economic value, widespread availability, and
   physical properties. However, environmental impacts of such intensive
   bamboo cultivation need to be assessed in order to avoid any negative
   consequences that could result from this plant's invasive potential. In
   this study, we sought to evaluate the possible implications of bamboo
   growth in diverse ecosystems, as well as its relations with riparian
   zones and local hydrology. We reviewed studies that have focused on
   cultivation of bamboo in various areas where they are not always native.
   Furthermore, we have provided an objective compilation of studies that
   report possible effects and impacts that bamboo may have in local
   landscapes where it has been introduced or established. We conclude
   that, regardless of bamboo being native or exotic in a region, it can
   become invasive in some ecosystems, even when a bamboo species does not
   show spreading characteristics. Introduction of bamboo in a new area
   needs preliminary studies to avoid the species that may become invasive
   and to minimize the risk of suppression of different stages of
   ecological succession in local vegetation and of the changes in the
   forest structure and diversity.},

Abstract = {Changes in soil resulting from agricultural practices can lead to

   Soil samples were collected in areas with and without Al3+ in a natural
   regeneration zone. Leaves of three herbaceous species prevalent in the
   rainy season underwent biochemical analysis. The results revealed that
   Al3+ influenced enzymatic activity in Ayenia erecta, reducing superoxide
   dismutase and increasing ascorbate peroxidase and catalase. Pavonia
   varians exhibited an accumulation of H2O2 and a reduction in ascorbate
   peroxidase, while Sida galheirensis demonstrated an accumulation of
   sucrose and a reduction in proline levels in areas affected by Al3+,
   without changes in enzymatic activity or the accumulation of reactive
   oxygen species. The presence of 0.31 cmolc/dm(3) of Al3+ was
   insufficient to induce lipid peroxidation in the studied species.
   Overall, the species responded differently to aluminium, impacting
   oxidative stress and potentially influencing their survival in the
   environment. These results provide insights into conservation practices
   and sustainable management in arid areas.},

Abstract = {Mangrove forests are important sinks of atmospheric carbon, and the
   internal deposits and fluxes of organic matter can reflect how these
   ecosystems respond to disturbances and environmental changes. Data on
   carbon content of mangrove forests vary geographically due to
   differences in abiotic (climate, geomorphic settings, tides) and biotic
   (diversity, herbivory, bioturbation) conditions. Mangroves have been
   degraded worldwide and ecological restoration is an alternative to
   recover these ecosystems and their functionality. However, although
   growing and biomass after disturbances have been addressed, studies on
   the recovery of faunal groups are rare. The brachyuran crab assemblage
   is strongly integrated to carbon recycling and ecosystem functioning,
   since propagule consumption and fossorial activity can affect the
   diversity and biomass of mangroves. We assessed the aboveground biomass
   and carbon stock of differently managed mangrove areas in northeastern
   Brazil, after being deforested for shrimp culture and then abandoned,
   and compared data with other forests worldwide. After a decade, the area
   restored with Rhizophora mangle showed higher carbon stock than the
   self-recovered forest and similar amount as an older forest. We discuss
   the applied rehabilitation measures regarding the effects of management
   and brachyuran crabs on forest aboveground carbon storage. The effects
   of herbivory and bioturbation of brachyurans on the low recruitment of
   Laguncularia racemosa propagules, contributed to higher biomass levels
   in the restored forest through reinforcing the predominance of R.
   mangle, which stocks more aboveground carbon with respect to
   Laguncularia. This suggests that the particularities of target tree
   species and brachyuran assemblage need to be considered in mangrove
   restoration, since they are related to function recovering and carbon
   cycling in the ecosystem.},

Abstract = {Tropical biodiversity benefits humanity. However, the costs of
   conserving topical biodiversity are largely borne by local communities.
   The damage caused by wild animals to human-cultivated plants
   (crop-raiding) in tropical ecosystems directly affects the livelihoods
   of local agriculturalists, which erodes their support for conserving
   biodiversity. We used data collected between 2013 and 2015 from 132
   camera-trap stations and responses from 157 interviewees representing 47
   semi-subsistence communities to quantify and contextualize terrestrial
   vertebrate crop-raiding damage to manioc (Manihot esculenta)
   agricultural fields (i.e., rocados) in the Medio-Jurua region of western
   Brazilian Amazonia. The 5 vertebrate species identified by respondents
   as the most damaging crop raiders were agoutis (Dasyprocta fuliginosa),
   collared peccaries (Pecari tajacu), pacas (Cuniculus paca), red brocket
   deer (Mazama americana), and spiny rats (family Echimyidae). These
   species were frequently detected by camera traps in early-successional
   forests. Respondents reported mean manioc stem losses to crop raiders of
   7.3\%/rocado. Proportional losses of more palatable manioc varieties
   were approximately 3 times higher than more phytochemically defended
   varieties, further constraining crop choice. Respondents estimated that
   in the absence of active crop-raider suppression, overall losses would
   have been 73.9\%/respondent/annum, and therefore invested substantial
   effort in crop protection. Small communities, already economically
   disadvantaged by isolation from the material, service, and information
   monopoly of urban centers, were most affected by crop raiding. Although,
   the most damaging crop raiders are ideal candidates for sustainable
   subsistence hunting, we found only weak evidence of positive
   opportunities for agriculturalists to hunt crop raiders to compensate
   for crop losses. Our study indicated that crop raiding may continue to
   exacerbate the challenges inherent in tropical agriculture and
   represents a significant forest ecosystem disservice. (C) 2018 The

Journal = {AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY},
Year = {2020},

Month = {NOV 15},
Abstract = {The conversion of primary forest (PF) to other types of land cover, such
   as pasture and agriculture, in Amazonia, affects regional carbon and
   water balances, significantly contributing to increased carbon emissions
   and reduced evapotranspiration. However, secondary forest (SF) growth,
   resulting from the abandonment of low-productivity pasture areas, offers
   a potential alternative to counterbalance the effects of deforestation
   on carbon release to the atmosphere and evapotranspiration reduction. In
   this work, we present four years of eddy flux measurements of a SF that
   is approximately 20 years old, located in Central Amazonia, and we
   compare these measurements with those of a PF in the same region,
   analyzing daily and seasonal variations in evapotranspiration, gross
   primary productivity of carbon and water use efficiency. On average,
   evapotranspiration is 20\% higher in the SF (3.6 mm day(-1)) than in the
   PF (3.1 mm day(-1)), while gross primary productivity is only 5\% higher
   in the SF (8.1 gC m(-2) day(-1)) than in the PF (7.8 gC m(-2) day(-1)).
   Despite robust evidence of higher evapotranspiration and gross primary
   productivity in SF, the estimated uncertainty range of WUE is large to
   reach definite conclusions about the differences on carbon gain per
   water loss between the sites. Nonetheless, the significantly higher
   evapotranspiration and gross primary productivity of SF may
   counterbalance both water and C losses from deforestation and has
   important implications for regional budgets.},

Abstract = {Logging machinery impacts site soil properties mainly through topsoil
   removal and compaction. The greatest soil disturbance occurs in the
   logging infrastructure areas: skid trails, roads and log landings.
   Although landings generally occupy less of the site than skid trails and
   roads, they suffer severe compaction usually accompanied with complete
   topsoil removal to level the soil surface for log decking and loading.
   Few long-term studies have quantified if landing soil properties
   recover, with none in the humid tropical forests of Amazonia. The aim of
   this study was to determine if soil bulk density, penetration resistance
   and fine root biomass in 27-year-old aban-doned log landings had
   returned to a similar state of the adjacent old-growth forest soils. The
   working hypothesis was that impacts on soil remained despite the
   regenerated stand of trees present on the landings. Results revealed
   that the soil physical properties in the log landings were still
   significantly higher than the controls. Furthermore, fine root biomass
   was still below the levels presented in the controls. Therefore, in log
   landings located on very clayey soils in Central Amazonia, soil
   compaction persists for at least 27 years.},

   of 5 ha (total of 100 plots in 500 ha sampled) and inventoried at 100\%
   one year before harvesting and again in 2015. The highest mortality rate
   occurred at five (9.6\%) and seven (7.2\% year(-1)) years after harvest,
   with a reduction from the age of eleven (4. 2\% year(-1)), when there
   was no significant difference for the control area (1.9\% year(-1)). The
   recruitment rate increased significantly (11.3\% year(-1)) at seven
   years and from eleven years stabilized. Logging reduced the number of
   individuals and basal area by more than 50\% in all areas after harvest.
   In explored areas the largest trees (DBH >= 75 cm) are more prone to
   mortality. The unexploited area has the highest rate of growth. The
   growth rate of Manilkara huberi increases proportionally to the size of
   the tree in the unexplored area.},

Abstract = {Enrichment planting is a strategy to increase tree diversity and

   the role that overstory taxonomic diversity and mean overstory to

   species beneath a mixed-species restoration plantation with three nested
   tree diversity levels of 19, 58, and 107 species and estimated the mean
   phylogenetic distance between each seedling species and the overstory
   community. Seedling performance was not significantly affected by
   overstory diversity or mean phylogenetic distance. Overall good
   performance of the seedlings shows that enrichment planting beneath a
   mixed-species overstory can be successful even under variations in
   overstory species number and phylogenetic distance. However, significant
   species-specific differences in performance highlight the importance of
   an informed selection of which species to enrich plant.},

Abstract = {Soil fertility differed substantially among three neighboring sites
   representing different stages of a shifting cultivation cycle on a
   deeply weathered Oxisol on the Chapada de Araripe in the semiarid region
   of NE Brazil. Samples taken from a native thorn forest area (Caatinga),
   from a recently slashed and burnt area (Burnt) and from a site abandoned
   after five years of manual cultivation to cassava (Abandoned), were
   compared using subtractive and additive fertilization greenhouse trials
   and incubations for C and N mineralization. The effect of burning was to
   increase soil nutrient content relative to the Caatinga area samples,
   followed by decreases of N and organic P by 20\%: available P by 70\%,
   and exchangeable bases by 55\%, on average, after abandonment. The
   unfertilized control of the missing-element trial gave the lowest dry
   matter (DM) yields, but still those of the Burnt were twice as large as
   those of the Abandoned area samples. The relative yield ratios were not
   changed by nutrient addition, although total yields were increased by a
   factor of 5. In all three areas, the most severe nutrient limitation was
   of P, followed by N. The N deficiency somewhat increased relative to P
   in the Abandoned samples. Addition of 25 mg P kg(-1) soil produced 4 to
   5-fold dry matter increases in the Caatinga and 7 to 8-fold increases in
   the Burnt area samples. Further increasing P levels improved yields only
   marginally and only at high additions of N and K. In samples from the
   abandoned area, 25 mg P kg(-1) not even doubled the dry matter yield,
   and no additional effects were observed for higher N and K rates. Carbon
   mineralization during the 12 week incubation followed the order Caatinga
   > Abandoned > Burnt, whereas the order for N removed in 13 leachings was
   Caatinga > Burnt > Abandoned. Accordingly, organic matter mineralized
   from the abandoned soil had a higher C:N ratio. In addition to the
   nutrient limitations of this Oxisol, samples from the Abandoned area
   exhibited further limitations resulting in yield reductions, which were
   not explained by any of the factors examined. This indicates that
   alternatives to long-fallow shifting cultivation will require further
   refinement of methodologies to measure and predict soil quality. (C)

Title = {Modelling the dynamics of soil moisture and soil water salinity in
   tropical saltmarshes},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL MODELLING},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {504},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Tropical saltmarshes share the intertidal zone with mangroves. In
   contrast to saltmarshes of temperate latitudes, these only occupy the
   uppermost niche of the intertidal zone, and are characterised by periods
   of severe drought and hypersalinity in the upper soil during dry
   seasons. Like mangroves, they show pronounced species zonation patterns
   along elevation gradients. The primary driver behind these soil water
   patterns is the variation in tidal flooding frequency, especially
   notable in the upper tidal zone. Precipitation is the second main source
   of water, and evapotranspiration and plant transpiration are further
   factors shaping soil water dynamics and driving plant growth. To
   describe and comprehend the soil water processes and their dynamics in
   tropical saltmarshes, we introduce the hydrological model SALTFRED. This
   model aims to mechanistically predict soil water salinity and root zone
   soil moisture, elucidating the intricate differentiation of drought and
   salt stress within the saltmarsh. The model explicitly describes
   processes of infiltration, seepage and evapotranspiration, along with
   their influence on the salinity of the soil water. We demonstrate its
   suitability with an application to a specific study site on the Bragan
   \& ccedil;a Peninsula (Para<acute accent>, Brazil). Utilising complete
   time series of tidal data and precipitation (for the year 2015), we
   predict drought and salt stress and compare simulated levels of stress
   with tolerance levels of the dominant vegetation types and saltmarsh
   species. Extreme salt and drought stress are defined as salt
   concentrations of 90 parts per thousand (ppt) and plant available water
   of 0.5 vol\% (0.005 cm3 water per cm3 of soil), respectively. The
   results suggest that mangrove vegetation thrives where these extreme
   stress conditions are persistently not reached due to regular flooding
   by the tides. In the saltmarsh, as elevation increases and the frequency
   of spring tide flooding decreases, longer periods without water
   infiltration occur. As a result, the duration of salt stress events
   increases. In the higher parts of the saltmarsh, additional drought
   stress is predicted. Our results confirm a robust correlation between
   simulated levels of seasonally varying drought and salt stress and
   tolerance levels of the dominant saltmarsh species Rhynchospora riparia,
   Fimbristylis cymosa, and Sporobolus virgincus at the study site.},

Abstract = {Climate change will substantially increase extreme rainfall events,
   especially in the Tropics, enhancing flood risks. Such imminent risks
   require climate adaptation strategies to endure extreme rainfall and
   increase drainage systems. Here, we evaluate the potential of
   nature-based solutions by using an ecosystem service modeling approach,
   evaluating the impact of extreme rainfall events on flood risks in a
   large urban area and with a real-world land recovery plan. We evaluate
   the cost-effectiveness of four different land recovery scenarios and
   associated co-benefits, based on a gradient increase in area recovered
   and cost of implementation. Although the scenarios reveal increasing
   flood risk reduction and co-benefits along with greater proportion of
   land recovery, the most cost-effective scenario was the one with an
   intermediate land recovery where 30\% of the study area would be
   reforested. We emphasize the striking benefits of nature-based solutions
   for flood risk reduction in cities, considering landscape scale and
   stakeholders' needs.},

Abstract = {Litter on spontaneous forest restoration can influence water balance and
   its ecological processes. In this study, we evaluated the stock of
   accumulated litter and its ex situ water retention by the Blow method in
   similar locations, at 4 levels of forest restoration spontaneously
   developed from the species Clidemia urceolata DC. in the following
   environments: abandoned pasture (S1), farmyard (S2), brushwood (S3), and
   forest fragment (S4). A sampler (0.25 x 0.25 x 0.05 m) was randomly
   prepared in 12 samples per treatment during the dry period. The largest
   stock of accumulated litter was observed in S4 (5.15 Mg ha(-1)) and the
   greatest water retention levels were found in S2 (343.87\%) and S3
   (339,94\%), demonstrating that biomass and species diversity influence
   production but do not affect the responses of litter water, whose
   greater retention levels are related to the presence of deciduous
   material from facilitative species in the poorly evolved phases and to
   lower retention levels in the more advanced stages (30 years of
   restoration), increasing soil moisture contents.},

Abstract = {Currently, it is unanimous the fact that the ecosystem approach gives
   important insights to support fisheries stock assessment and management
   and healthy sustain aquatic ecosystems. This work aims at the
   quantification of energy flows at varzea (Amazon floodplain) and the
   simulation of increase in the fishing effort regarding the biggest
   predators, the catfish, and decrease of flooded forest cover. It was
   used the Ecopath with Ecosim software to build BAGRES model, which could
   allow inferences on ecosystem stability. Results showed that: i) BAGRES
   model has high overhead (69.7\%) and Production/Respiration rate very
   close to 1, showing that this floodplain system is sufficiently mature
   and capable to support disturbance; ii) Finn's cycling index for BAGRES
   (14.6\%) is high when compared to other worldwide system; iii)
   increasing the effort of the catch of three species of Brachyplatystoma
   (catfish) have positive effects on biomass and consequently catch and
   landing of their main preys; iv) in the simulation of deforestation of
   Floodplain Forest (with no natural regeneration), all species are
   prejudiced (no exception), including Brachyplatystoma groups that do not
   use flooded environment. Therefore, the indirect consequence of the
   deforestation is more intense over fish stocks than increasing fishing
   effort. The BAGRES model results have important implications for the
   current policy-making for inland fishing in Brazil, currently mostly
   based on ``defeso{''} (fishing restriction season), suggesting the
   necessity of incorporate the impacts which drive the deforestation in
   Amazon Floodplain.},

Abstract = {Ecological restoration has the potential to improve and recover soil
   quality, helping to mitigate soil degradation worldwide. However, soil
   monitoring is often overlooked in restoration, preventing a
   comprehensive understanding of how restoration interventions affect soil
   quality and the time required for recovering different soil properties.
   Herein, we tested if MAR areas (moderately assisted recovery-tree
   plantings) in the early restoration stage have better soil quality (and
   ecosystem services) than UNR areas (unassisted natural
   recovery-abandoned pastures) and pastures in continuous use (PCU). We
   collected 72 soil samples in three 5-year-old MAR areas and three
   5-year-old UNR areas, one PCU, and one reference ecosystem (RE) in the
   Brazilian Atlantic Forest (Mata Atlantica). A total of 45 variables
   representing macrofauna, fertility, structure, and aggregation were
   measured and then submitted to multivariate analyses to compute
   sub-indicators and a general indicator of soil quality (GISQ). The
   richness of orders and classes, cationic exchange capacity, total
   porosity, and biogenic aggregates contributed the most to the
   sub-indicators. MAR and UNR areas had similar values to the RE for
   macrofauna, structure, and aggregation sub-indicators, but they were far
   below the RE for fertility. In addition, all areas had lower GISQ values
   than the RE. Soils were classified as high quality in RE and medium
   quality in other areas. Our study evidences that some soils' physical
   and biological properties can be rapidly recovered through forest
   restoration, but 5 years is not enough time to change the general soil
   quality and make restoration areas have better conditions than the
   previous land use. If the restoration goal is to have high soil quality
   in the short term, corrective actions should be taken to improve soil
   fertility and help the area along the desired trajectory.},

   local and the national levels and how their idealism can set examples
   throughout the world. It is argued that a culture based on principles of
   environmental ethics should be encouraged in all educational levels
   throughout the globe. And this has a series of implications such as: the
   abandonment of the current anthropocentric, egoistic, materialistic,
   consumerist way of living; the abandonment of absolute national
   sovereignty by governments in favor of a Global Environmental
   Governance; the unrelentingly combat of corruption at all levels of
   government in many countries, including Brazil. We are subject to the
   interests of powerful international enterprises and the surreptitious
   lawful techno-bureaucracy they impose on us. And the current tendency is
   that their influence will grow bigger and bigger as technological
   novelties are put into the market. To bring it to a stop and reverse it
   is not an easy task, but there are examples in history that changes can
   take place when people have firm belief in their cause. Chico Mendes and
   Jose Lutzenberger set examples that, regardless of one's geography, or
   socioeconomic and political conditions, each and everyone's contribution
   is precious. It is the collective effort from peasants to presidents

Journal = {CATENA},

Volume = {158},
Pages = {121-130},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The factors that control the heterogeneous canopy of the Amazonian
   rainforest have long been a topic of interest for research. Among all
   hypotheses, changes in landscape due to geological processes have been
   increasingly defended. Large areas of open vegetation in the northern
   Amazonian lowlands are confined to paleolandforms created by the
   abandoning of megafan depositional systems. Previous investigations
   related the megafan sedimentation in this region to Late
   Pleistocene-Holocene tectonic reactivations. However, the influence of
   neotectonics on both the Amazonian megafans and associated vegetation
   cover remains to be further investigated. We studied a depression
   preliminarily noticed in the south-central sector of one Amazonian
   megafan (i.e., Virua megafan) aiming to determine if its genesis was due
   to recent tectonic subsidence after the megafan abandoning. The
   investigation combined morphostructural, hydrological and remote sensing
   reflectance analyses, as well as characterization of floristic
   communities in the modern and ancient environments based respectively on
   field inventories and palynological data. The results indicated a neatly
   10-km long and rectangular-shaped area having straight margins
   paralleling NNE/SSW-trending regional structural lineaments.
   Hydrological analysis suggests that this area experiences the largest
   floods during wet seasons, a condition compatible with the topographic
   data that revealed a smoother gradient of similar to 3 m comparing this
   area with others from the megafan plain. In the studied depression,
   numerous forest patches are arranged as sets of parallel straight lines
   trending consistently in the NE/SW direction. The patches have spectral
   values that differ significantly from other forest patches over the
   megafan surface, being compared to those of seazonally-flooded forests,
   such as igapos and varzeas, that surround the megafan paleolandform. In
   addition, a forest patch within the depression revealed trees
   physiologically adapted to tolerate submersion 6 to 7 months per year,
   which is also a characteristic of the inundated forests external to the
   megafan. These data altogether led us to conclude that the studied
   depression consists of a shallow subsiding basin formed by tectonic
   reactivations in the mid/late Holocene. Tectonic instability at around 2
   cal kyr BP further disturbed this system by creating NE/SW-trending
   lakes and leading to the replacement of seazonally-flooded forests by
   grasslands. Thus, tectonic activity in a relatively recent geological
   time must be accounted when analyzing plant distribution in the
   Amazonian wetlands.},

Abstract = {The aim of this paper was to conduct a temporal evaluation of the
   deposition of litter in a human-disturbed area of caatinga in a process
   of natural regeneration for 16 years. The study was conducted at the
   Institute for Agronomical Research - IPA station in Caruaru, state of
   Pernambuco. Litter was collected monthly throughout the year on a total
   area of 5.48 m(2). The total litter was kg ha yaer(-1) 9158.93,
   consisting of 28.90\%, 16.82\%, 16.95\% and 37.33\% of leaves, twigs,
   seeds and miscellaneous, respectively. There were seasonal differences
   in the deposition of litter, with higher deposition in the dry season.
   However, there was no monthly variation in the deposition of litter
   between the months of the season and, and with the exception of the
   miscellaneous fraction precipitation, it did not maintain connection
   with the deposition of litter. The paper concluded that after 16 years
   of regeneration, the area has anthropogenic litter deposition pattern

Abstract = {Logging wastes of tropical species managed sustainably in the Brazilian
   Amazon are promising for replacing fossil fuels. However, their use in
   local energy systems is challenging concerning many mixed-species with
   unknown properties. This study focuses on the energy characterization of
   the logging wastes from twenty commercial Amazon species harvested in a
   sustainable management plan and their energy equivalence to fossil
   fuels. The wood species were grouped by principal component analysis
   according to their basic density, moisture content, maximum moisture
   content, heating value, energy density, and chemical composition. Basic
   density (0.525-0.895 g cm(-3)), energy density (9.4-16.8 GJ m(-3)), ash
   (0.3-2.5\%), and total extractives (1.8-17.9\%) showed wide
   interspecific variations. On the other hand, the carbon content
   (49.2-52.4\%), total lignin (30.2-38.1\%), fixed carbon (16.5-22.0\%),
   volatile matter (76.7-82.8\%), and higher heating value (19.1-20.9 MJ
   kg(-1)) varied less among species. D. excelsa, M. elata, P. altissium,
   and G. glabra wastes surpassed conventional planted species for
   bioenergy applications. The logging wastes formed four groups with
   similar properties aiming at energy systems. The fuelwood value index
   ranked wastes of D. excelsa wood as the most promising for bioenergy.
   Finally, D. excelsa wood wastes presented the largest mass of CO(2)eq
   fixed in 1 m(3) of logging wastes (1,687 kg), meaning that the use of 1
   m(3) of these wastes would mitigate the emission of 1,687 kg of CO(2)eq.},

Title = {A Systematic Review of Logging Impacts in the Amazon Biome},
Journal = {FORESTS},
Year = {2023},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Every year, logging in the world's largest tropical forest, located
   within the Amazon biome, continues unabated. Although it is a preferred
   alternative to deforestation, the residual stand and site are impacted
   by logging. The objective of this review was to determine and assess the
   current state of research throughout Amazonia on the subject of logging
   impacts. To achieve this goal, a systematic approach was utilized to
   gather, assess and categorize research articles conducted in the Amazon
   biome over the last decade. Eligibility for inclusion of articles
   required demonstration of a direct impact from logging operations. A
   total of 121 articles were determined to meet the eligibility
   requirements and were included in this review. Articles were subdivided
   into three environmental categories: forest (n = 85), wildlife (n = 24)
   and streams (n = 12). The results of this review demonstrated that
   impacts from logging activities to the forest site were a direct result
   of the logging cycle (e.g., how often logging occurs) or logging
   intensity (e.g., how many trees are felled). The impacts to wildlife
   varied dependent on species, whereas impacts to streams were affected
   more by the logging system. Overall, research suggested that to attain
   sustainability and diminish the impacts from logging, a lower logging
   intensity of 10-15 m(3) ha(-1) and a longer logging cycle of 40-60 years
   would be essential for the long-term viability of forest management in
   Amazonia.},

Title = {EVALUATION OF THE GROWTH AND SURVIVAL OF MANGROVE SEEDLINGS UNDER
   DIFFERENT LIGHT INTENSITIES: SIMULATING THE EFFECT OF MANGROVE
   DEFORESTATION},
Journal = {REVISTA ARVORE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {43},
Number = {3},
Abstract = {Environmental factors, especially light, temperature, and edaphic
   conditions are of great importance for the establishment of plant
   communities. In areas degraded by deforestation, these factors can vary
   greatly, which may affect the recolonization of the typical populations
   in the altered area. This study evaluated the development of seedlings
   of pioneer mangrove species under different levels of shading in soil
   substrate degraded by deforestation, aiming to assess the effect of
   deforestation on the recolonization of mangrove forests, which may be of
   help in the production of seedlings and recovery of deforested areas.
   The study was conducted in the municipality of Acarau in the state of
   Ceara, Brazil. The species Avicennia schaueriana Stapf and Leechm. ex
   Moldenke (1939) and Laguncularia racemosa C. F. Gaertn (1807) were used
   in the study, and the substrate was collected from an area impacted by
   deforestation. The propagules and seedlings were exposed to full sun and
   30, 50 and 70\% shading. The results revealed that the treatment at full
   sun had the lowest germination rate of 86.66\% for L. racemosa.
   Seedlings of both species showed a significant difference and better
   quality between shading treatments and full sun. The height of the
   seedlings showed a correlation above -0.90 with ambient temperature. L.
   racemosa tested in full sun had a viable seedling reduction of 50\% and
   A. schaueriana was superior. It is concluded that the natural
   regeneration of a mangrove area can be compromised under the conditions
   of total deforestation with high sun exposure and degraded soils. Human
   intervention in providing 50\% shading is essential for the development
   of seedlings and regeneration of the area impacted by deforestation.},

Title = {Prioritising areas for wildfire prevention and post-fire restoration in
   the Brazilian Pantanal},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {176},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {In 2020, fires in the Pantanal, the world's largest continuous tropical
   wetland, made global news. The flames destroyed almost one-third of the
   biome. Furthermore, 43\% of the affected area was burnt for the first
   time in 20 or even more years. As the combination of extreme drought and
   anthropogenic actions that caused these extreme wildfires is still
   prevalent, scientifically informed actions are necessary to prevent
   catastrophic fires in the future. Fire prevention, as well as
   restoration need to be spatially prioritised, as it is unfeasible to
   plan actions for the whole extent (150,355 km(2)) of the Brazilian
   Pantanal. In this study, we identified areas of high fire risk based on
   meteorological fire risk tendency for 1980-2020, fire intensity, last
   year with fire, the recurrence of fires for 2003-2020, and remaining
   areas of natural forest vegetation around watercourses. These native
   remnants include unburnt areas that can serve as refuges for
   fire-sensitive species and are important for fire prevention. We
   identified 246 km(2) with high fire risk, i.e., high probability of
   megafires, with vegetation types that support fire-sensitive plant
   species. We found that while 179 km(2) had high or medium natural
   regeneration potential, 66 km(2) had low potential and needed active
   restoration. Over 3120 km(2) have been severely degraded by recent
   fires. About 93\% of these areas have high or medium potential for
   natural regeneration, where the suggested actions are passive
   restoration and Integrated Fire Management. We estimated the cost of
   post-fire restoration for areas with high and medium potential for
   natural regeneration to be around 123 million USD. In areas with low
   regeneration potential (219 km(2)), we suggest active restoration. The
   cost to restore these areas using transplanted seedlings or enrichment
   planting is estimated between 28 and 151 million USD.},

Abstract = {In this article, we investigate the loss of local ecological knowledge
   (LEK) of wild mammals among quilombolas in southeastern Brazil. Using an
   Event Ecology approach, free listing exercises, questionnaires, and
   semi-structured interviews, we recorded local knowledge relevant to wild
   mammals as well as key events in the life histories of residents. Next,
   we built a causal model connecting age; formal education; years outside
   the community; years in the pre-village context; and individuals' degree
   of LEK. Statistical analysis showed that the formation of sedentary
   communities and the abandonment of swidden cultivation among young
   people are the main sources of the erosion of LEK observed. This is the
   first study connecting a decrease in swidden cultivation with loss of
   local knowledge about fauna. The importance of swidden cultivation for
   non-agricultural domains of knowledge was somewhat surprising and
   particularly relevant in the current scenario of a worldwide collapse of
   this horticultural system.},

Title = {Land use and occupation and the relation with the fragility of forest

Journal = {CADERNOS DE GEOGRAFIA},
Year = {2019},
Number = {40},
Pages = {37-52},
Abstract = {In Portugal as in large areas of Mediterranean Europe there were
   important changes in land use and occupation, especially after the
   second half of the twentieth century. These changes include agricultural
   abandonment and afforestation of land previously occupied by agriculture
   as a result of the rural exodus and also of adopted public policies.
   Thus, the present work aims to evaluate the land use and occupation, the
   physical (climatic, geomorphological and pedological) and historical
   factors and the fragilities identified in the remnants of native
   vegetation existing in the Certima River Basin in Portugal. Therefore, a
   general diagnosis of the study area was performed from the following
   geoindicators: biome; climate; geomorphology; geology; pedology;
   hypsometry and declivity. Then, landscape metrics from three categories,
   size, border and shape, were calculated; and are applied to the basin in
   general, considering the mapped forest remnants. To assess the quality
   of existing forest vegetation, a field analysis was carried out at
   selected locations in the Certima river basin using the Landscape
   Assessment Protocol (LAP) method. Thus, it can be observed that most of
   vegetation cover in the Certima river basin is composed of eucalyptus,
   and a total of 1220 forest remnants were identified, occupying an area
   of 8, 547.05 ha, equivalent to 15.89\% of the basin area.},

Abstract = {Large areas of tropical forests have been converted to agricultural land
   and subsequently abandoned. If restoration can occur on these abandoned
   lands, it offers great potential for biodiversity recovery, carbon
   sequestration, and enhanced ecosystem services. To understand the
   interaction between different forms of anthropogenic degradation and
   restoration strategies we examined biomass accumulation at two different
   scales. First, using small scale comparisons where the tree species
   pool, climate, and dispersers were similar, we quantified regeneration
   in degraded sites in Kibale National Park, Uganda subjected to different
   restoration strategies. Second, we contrasted biomass accumulation for
   57 tropical studies where the nature and time since disturbance
   differed. The above ground biomass of 10-32 year old forest in Kibale
   ranged from 15,675 to 34,294 kg/ha and was a function of the type of the
   management strategy used to promote regeneration. The above ground
   biomass accumulation from other tropical sites ranged extensively; from
   470 kg/ha in an 8 year old abandoned pasture in Brazil to 272,000 kg/ha
   in a 16 year old abandoned agricultural field in Mexico. Overall, the
   time since abandonment was a good predictor of biomass accumulation.
   This review demonstrates that once left to regenerate, secondary forests
   accumulate above ground biomass in a very positive manner; however, the
   speed of biomass accumulation can be facilitated by site-specific
   restoration strategies. Both the cost and efficiency of different
   restoration strategies vary dramatically and our research in Kibale
   suggests that making larger financial investments does not necessarily
   result in more positive biomass accumulation. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {The objective was to characterize the wood product commercially known as
   pau-de-escora in Manaus, Amazonas. Pau-de-escora is a key foundation
   material to build concrete lining or storey in tower buildings. The use
   of pau-de-escora is very popular in Manaus even in public building
   construction. To carry out the analyses and the anatomical
   identification of the material, we used 450 pau-de-escora poles, which
   were apprehended by the Environmental Battalion of Amazonas Police
   Force. It was also carried out a social survey to better understand the
   dynamics of the trade of this product in Manaus. The length of the 450
   poles averaged 3.74 +/- 0.08 m (CI 95\%) and diameter at the base
   averaged 4.48 +/- 0.03 cm (CI 95\%). These small differences related to
   the means indicate that the market requires a very clear dimension
   pattern for this wood product. The seven most abundant families
   encountered were: Fabaceae, Annonaceae, Sapotaceae, Lecythidaceae,
   Lauraceae, Burseraceae and Chrysobalanaceae. The selling price of
   pau-de-escora pole in Manaus averaged R\$2.63, and the buying price
   averaged R\$ 3.94. The custody chain of pau-de-escora is completely
   illegal not only in Brazil, perhaps worldwide because it is part of the
   natural regeneration of primary or recovery forests.},

   leaf scale, young C. brasiliensis plants have photosynthetic
   characteristics of shade-tolerant species, with low photosynthetic
   plasticity when grown under different light environments. For this,
   seedlings were subjected to four light treatments (60, 35, 25, and 15\%
   full sunlight, corresponding to about 20.9, 11.9, 9.1, and 5.4 mol
   photons m(-2) day(-1), respectively) for 5 months. We evaluated the
   photosynthetic plasticity at the leaf scale through morphological and
   anatomical variables, as well as variables associated with the
   diffusive, photochemical, and biochemistry phases of photosynthesis. All
   key photosynthetic variables measured exhibited values of typical shaded
   leaves. The highest simplified relative distance plasticity index (RDPI)
   for light treatments was found for light compensation point (0.32),
   performance index (0.30), photochemical reflectance index (0.30),
   mesophyll conductance (0.27), dark respiration rate (0.27), and leaf
   area (0.19). The lowest RDPI for light treatments was found for the leaf
   anatomical variables (< 0.1). From the 22 photosynthesis-related
   variables analyzed, we conclude that, on a leaf scale, young C.
   brasiliensis plants exhibit characteristics of a typical shade-tolerant
   species. Based on our results, we can recommend the plantation of C.
   brasiliensis seedlings in forest enrichment programs or agroforestry
   systems, in which other tree species are present providing light
   environments below 35\% full sunlight or about 10 mol photons m(-2)
   day(-1).},

Abstract = {The movement of frugivores between remnant forests and successional
   areas is vital for tropical forest tree species to colonize successional
   habitats. The response of these species to the spatial structure of
   pasture tree cover is largely unknown. We studied avian frugivores that
   were found in primary forest edges and large pastures in eastern
   Amazonia, Brazil. We determined how the small-scale spatial structure of
   pasture trees at forest edges affects five response variables: bird
   presence, visitation rate, duration of visit, species richness, and an
   index accounting for species level of frugivory and abundance in
   forests. We used hierarchical linear models to estimate the effect of
   four predictor variables on response variables: (1) clustering of
   pasture trees; (2) percent canopy cover of pasture trees; (3) distance
   of pasture tree to forest edge; and (4) tree crown area. The study
   species, many of which are widely distributed in the Neotropics, were
   generally insensitive to percent cover and clustering of trees.
   Frugivore visitation to individual trees remained constant as cover
   increased. Visitation was positively correlated with focal tree distance
   to forest edge and crown area. The positive relationship between
   distance and visitation rates may be due to the increased abundance of
   some resource further from forests. If pastures were abandoned the
   distance from forest edges would not likely limit frugivore visitation
   and seed deposition under large pasture trees in our study (i.e., up to
   200 m distant).},

Abstract = {Several colonisation projects were implemented in the Brazilian Legal
   Amazon in the 1970s and 1980s. Among these colonisation projects, the
   most prominent were those with the ``fishbone `` and ``topographic ``
   models. Within this scope, the settlements known as Anari and Machadinho
   stand out because they are contiguous areas with different models and
   structures of occupation and colonisation. The main objective of this
   work was to evaluate the dynamics of Land-Use and Land-Cover (LULC) in
   two different colonisation models, implanted in the State of Rondonia in
   the 1980s. The fishbone and topographic or Disorganised Multidirectional
   models were implemented in the Anari and Machadinho settlements,
   respectively. A 36-year time series of Landsat images (1984-2020) was
   used to evaluate the rates and trends in the LULC process in the
   different colonisation models. In the analysed models, a rapid loss of
   primary and secondary forests (anthropized areas) was observed, mainly
   due to the dynamics of its use, established by the Agriculture/Pasture
   relation with a heavy dependence on road construction. Understanding
   these two forms of occupation can help the future programs and
   guidelines of the Brazilian Legal Amazon and any tropical rainforest
   across the globe.},

Abstract = {Natural regeneration is critical for sustaining mangrove ecosystems,
   particularly the Sundarbans, the world's largest mangrove forest. This
   study assessed the impacts of biotic and abiotic factors on regeneration
   dynamics, examining spatial variations across salinity zones and
   temporal changes (2010-2020) using data from 30 permanent sample plots
   (PSPs) established by the Mangrove Silviculture Division, Bangladesh
   Forest Research Institute. We found that the biodiversity of the
   Sundarbans remained relatively stable over time, with a high M \&
   uuml;eller-Dombois Similarity Index and low Bray-Curtis Dissimilarity
   Index across years and zones. However, salinity variations influenced
   species composition. The study also revealed a decline in the dominance
   of Heritiera fomes and an increase in the abundance of Excoecaria
   agallocha (showed habitat expansion) over time while both species
   maintained a high importance value. The total biomass growth from living
   (77.84 Mg/ha) and newly established trees (14.39 Mg/ha) was low, while
   the biomass loss (81.79 Mg/ha) from the dead trees was significant.
   Furthermore, our analysis indicated that abiotic factors, including
   salinity, siltation, and soil pH, had minimal influence on plant
   functional traits, but changes in basal area notably affected biomass
   dynamics. These findings provide insights into the regeneration trends
   of the Sundarbans and guide the formulation of policies to manage this
   unique ecosystem sustainably.},

   2005 to March 2007. Of these, 245 nests were small, 9 were of medium
   size, and 18 were large nests. During the rainy season (from June to
   February), nests grew 94.2 L, whereas during the dry season (March-May),
   their total growth was 23 L The number of abandoned nests was positively
   correlated with rainfall. Decomposition of nests was greater during the
   rainy season. The pattern of nest distribution was associated with the
   distribution of the primary supporting plants. Rainfall appears to be
   one of the most important factors in the dynamics of growth of nests of

Abstract = {Ecological succession in tropical savannas is limited by seasonal fire,
   which affects habitat quality. Although fire may cause negligible or
   positive effects on animals occupying savannas, most short-term studies
   (months to a few years) are based on a single temporal sampling
   snapshot, and long-term studies (decades) are rare. We sampled four
   lizard species (Rainbow Whiptail, Cnemidophorus lemniscatus (Linnaeus,
   1758); Striped Whiptail, Kentropyx striata (Daudin, 1802); Grass Anole,
   Norops auratus Dumeril and Bibron, 1837 = Anolis auratus Daudin, 1802;
   Amazon Racerunner, Ameiva ameiva (Linnaeus, 1758)) in Amazonian savannas
   to test the effects of fire and vegetation cover on lizard densities at
   two temporal scales. In the short term, we use three sampling snapshots
   to test the effects of fire and vegetation cover on estimated lizard
   densities over the subsequent 1-5 years. In the long term, we test the
   effects of fire and changes in vegetation cover over 21 years on current
   lizard density differences. In the short term, species responses were
   usually consistent with foraging and thermoregulation modes. However,
   the results were not consistent among species and years, although the
   variances in species density explained by year as a random factor were
   generally low. In the long term, the main effects of fire and vegetation
   cover show that lizard densities may change spatially, but not
   necessarily temporarily. Wildfire is a natural resource of savannas and
   apparently have little impact on resident lizards of that ecosystem.},

Abstract = {This paper addresses the estimation of vertical vegetation density
   profiles from multibaseline interferometric synthetic aperture radar
   (InSAR) data from the AirSAR aircraft at C band over primary, secondary,
   and abandoned-pasture stands at La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica
   in 2004. Profiles were also estimated from field data taken in 2006 and
   lidar data taken with the LVIS, 25 m spot instrument in 2005. After
   motivating the study of tropical forest profiles based on their role in
   the global carbon cycle, ecosystem state, and biodiversity, this paper
   describes the InSAR, field, and lidar data acquisitions and analyses.
   Beyond qualitative agreement between profiles from the 3 measurement
   techniques, results show that InSAR and lidar profile-averaged mean
   height have RMS scatters about field-measured means of 3.4 m and 3.2 m,
   16\% and 15\% of the average mean height, respectively. InSAR and lidar
   standard deviations of the vegetation distribution have RMS scatters
   about the field standard deviations of 1.9 m and 1.5 m, or 27\% and
   21\%, respectively. Dominant errors in the profile-averaged mean height
   for each measurement technique were modeled. InSAR inaccuracies,
   dominated by ambiguities in finding the ground altitude and coherence
   calibration, together account for about 3 m of InSAR error in the mean
   height. The dominant, modeled error for the field measurements was the
   inaccuracy in modeling the trees as uniformly filled volumes of leaf
   area, inducing field errors in mean height of about 3 m. The dominant,
   modeled lidar error, also due to finding the ground, was 2 m.},

Title = {Quality assessment of the PRODES Cerrado deforestation data},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {21},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The prominent role assumed by Brazil in the global environmental agenda
   in recent years has prompted the creation of legal provisions and the
   formulation of environmental policies and instruments aimed at improved
   and sustainable territorial governance. Within this context, the
   Brazilian government implemented in 2016, with the support of the Forest
   Investment Program (FIP), the first systematic and official monitoring
   initiative focused on the detection of vegetation suppression (since
   2000) in the Cerrado, the second largest biome in Brazil and a global
   biodiversity hotspot. In this study, we assess, based on sampling
   procedures and field work, the quality of the PRODES Cerrado data, which
   is being generated according to the well-known and consolidated PRODES
   Amaz <\^{}>onia methodology. Our sample-based validation indicated an
   overall accuracy of 93.17 +/- 0.89\% (in line with the four fieldworks
   findings) and that the anthropization process in the Cerrado surpassed
   50\% of the biome in 2013, a situation identified by the PRODES Cerrado
   only in 2018. Although this discrepancy, there is a very good
   convergence between the PRODES Cerrado data and the sample estimates in
   more recent years. In fact, the PRODES Cerrado is a product in process
   of continuous improvement, in which the quality of the detected
   deforestation increases over the years. Therefore, the PRODES Cerrado
   monitoring system is adequate to be used in support of governance
   instruments capable of curbing or even zeroing deforestation in the
   biome, where, as our study revealed, there are similar to 104,000 km(2)
   of abandoned land, which could be used for the expansion of the
   Brazilian agricultural production in the coming years.},

   for each population before and after logging. Tree density varied from
   0.04 to 0.25 trees. ha-1 before logging and the area showing greatest
   pre-logging density suffered the strongest decline in density (-50\%)
   and basal area (-53,8\%). We observed a decrease in the total number of
   alleles and loss of rare alleles. Ecological and genetic impacts of
   logging varied according to the initial conditions of our populations
   (in population structure and density). Based on our results, we
   recommend that management plans consider cutting limits per species per
   plot in order to avoid super-exploitation of species that are locally
   more frequent.},

Abstract = {American cutaneous leishmaniasis (ACL) is a notifiable dermatozoonosis
   with relevant morbidity. The present study aimed to evaluate the
   epidemiological aspects of cases of ACL reported in Northern Parana
   (2007-2016), as well as to georeference and analyse the influence of
   economic, social and environmental variables. Data from ACL notification
   forms were obtained and the patients' houses were georeferenced.
   Descriptive statistics, calculations of disease incidence and proportion
   of vegetation cover by municipality, spatial analysis, multiple linear
   regression and vulnerability analysis by census sector (CS) were
   performed. One thousand four hundred fifty-one cases of ACL were
   reported in the 89 municipalities of four regional health (RH). The
   average incidence of cases per 10,000 inhabitants was as follows: 11.58,
   8.79, 4.92 and 4.03 in 18thRH, 15thRH, 16thRH and 17thRH. Peaks of
   incident cases were observed in 2008, 2012 and 2015. There was a
   statistically significant difference between the HR when comparing the
   proportions of the variables gender, age, education level, area of
   residence, clinical form, diagnostic criteria, response to treatment and
   drug used in case of failure. It was observed that the lower the
   proportion of remaining Atlantic Forest, the greater the incidence of
   ACL in the municipality. With regard to clusters analysis, treatment
   abandonment clusters were observed in the 15thRH and mucous form
   clusters were observed in the 15thRH, 16thRH and 17thRH. The
   vulnerability analysis by CS allowed us to observe a statistically
   significant difference in all vulnerability indicators: economic and
   social in 15thRH and 17thRH; home infrastructure in 15thRH and 18thRH,
   urban infrastructure in 15thRH and 18thRH and compound vulnerability
   index in 15thRH and 18thRH. However, the most vulnerable areas did not
   always have the highest number of cases. The data presented demonstrate
   that preventive and health education measures must be mainly directed to
   areas of greater degradation of native forest; regardless of the
   vulnerability situation.},

Title = {Shade-Grown Coffee in Colombia Benefits Soil Hydraulic Conductivity},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {14},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Secondary tropical forests and coffee agroforestry systems contain fewer
   trees than native forests but can positively impact soil hydrological
   functions, such as water infiltration compared to the pasture land that
   they replace. However, for both land uses it remains in how far the soil
   hydraulic characteristics are comparable to that of native forest.
   Therefore, we investigated the saturated hydraulic conductivity (K-s)
   and some hydrophysical soil attributes in four land-use types: (i) a
   shade-grown coffee; (ii) a natural regenerated forest 15 years ago;
   (iii) a pasture; and (iv) a reference forest, in the municipality of La
   Jagua de Ibirico, Cesar department, Colombia. We determined historical
   land use and conducted soil sampling, using the Beerkan method to
   determine the K-s values. We also measured canopy cover, vegetation
   height, diameter at breast height and total number of trees in the
   forest covers. Our results indicate that K-s values were similar for the
   coffee and the reference forest, reflecting the positive effect of trees
   on soil hydrological functioning in agroforestry systems. Our results
   suggest that 15 years of forest regeneration after land abandonment in
   Sub-Andean Forest, can improve the soil hydraulic attributes.
   Additionally, soil water repellency was observed for the reference
   forest soil.},

Abstract = {We performed a forest inventory in a fragment of stricto sensu Cerrado
   to evaluate alpha and beta temporal diversity among adult and natural
   regeneration (NR) strata. Fifteen plots of 1,000 m(2) (20 x 50 m) were
   set to sample the adult stratum, and each plot divided in sub-plots of
   100 m(2) (2 x 50 m) to sample NR. We registered the qualitative
   (species) and quantitative (height and diameter) floristic composition.
   Natural Regeneration stratum was divided into three diameter classes (I,
   II and III). Moreover, species collected on non oriented paths were
   registered. We estimated alpha diversity through Shannon index (H'),
   Pielou index (J') and ``one-step{''} jackknife estimator. Sorensen (So -
   qualitative) and Czekanowski (SC - quantitative) indexes were used to
   evaluate beta diversity. In total, 101 species distributed in 71 genera
   and 36 families were recorded. For the adult and NR strata, H' values
   were 3.06 and 3.14 nats per individual, and J' 0.75 and 0.71,
   respectively. Both strata had qualitative similarity. Natural
   regeneration showed no similarity with adult stratum by Czekanowski
   index, although this distance tends to decline with the progressive size
   of each class. The temporal beta diversity is low between these strata;
   and there is a trend of increasing similarity with the maturity of NR.},

   Sul, giving prominence to forests' transition. The images from the
   Landsat TM sensor platform 5 and the Spring application, was classified
   images, determining the following land use classes: bare soil, water,
   agricultural use, sand, native forest and plantation forests. For the
   generation of thematic maps was used to LEGAL Analysis (GIS Spatial
   Algebraic Language), tool that enables spatial analysis using map
   algebra. From the generation of thematic maps were calculated areas
   where there was the expansion of native forests (7.55\% of total area) -
   areas where natural regeneration has occurred, becoming forest in 2010.
   The area that has remained the use of native forest over 18 years is
   2.83\% of the total area. Deforestation, forest areas belonging to
   native and has reverted to another use, is 1.23\%. Reforestation,
   represented by the areas that now belong to the class planted forest was
   quantified at 0.57\% of the total area of microregion. The remaining
   land use change (86.98\% of total area) were among the other classes of
   land use. The work allowed us to observe the changes in land use over a
   period of 18 years, it was observed an increase in forest area, both
   native and planted. This increase is probably related to the investment
   in the forest sector in the region since 2005, accompanied by the

Title = {Vegetation structure and edaphic factors in veredas reflect
   different conservation status in these threatened areas},
Journal = {FOREST ECOSYSTEMS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {9},
Abstract = {Background: In Cerrado humid areas, veredas are considered as
   hygrophilous communities, marked by the presence of the Mauritia
   flexuosa palm tree emerging in the wetter zones. Changes in veredas
   ecosystems due to drought and changes in the water table, which
   represent important areas for biodiversity maintenance in the Brazilian
   cerrado, can lead to the emergence of new landscapes and ecosystems.
   Assuming that the veredas are changed in species composition due to
   anthropogenic factors, in this study, we evaluated the flora composition
   and described the current vegetation profile of two veredas under
   different disturbances levels that are located in the north of Minas
   Gerais State, Brazil. Results: Altogether, 2,268 individuals of 91
   species belonging to 36 families were recorded. Our results demonstrated
   that the studied veredas were floristically different in terms of the
   arboreous-shrubby species composition, richness, and diversity. Despite
   the hygrophilous forest formations and open areas in the two veredas
   present typical species from these environments (same species with high
   importance values), the drought in the water table caused an expansion
   of Cerrado species in the open areas and in the hygrophilous forest.
   Furthermore, in the hygrophilous forest there was an increase in the
   abundance of species that occur in less saturated soils. Conclusion: Our
   results demonstrate that the studied veredas are changing in species
   composition due to anthropogenic factors which leads to the drought of
   these formations (water balance effect). These anthropogenic effects
   cause a modification with the expansion and increase in the abundance of
   typical species of other areas of Cerrado and resistant to less
   saturated soils, leading to the veredas collapse. Finally, future
   studies should investigate other veredas on a broader scale to detect
   changes in the water table that lead to a consequent change in
   vegetation structure. In this way, we will have support for the
   conscientious management and conservation of these areas that represent
   equilibrium places for the Cerrado biome.},

Volume = {41},

Abstract = {Restoration after mining often requires strong interventions, including
   soil reconstruction, which makes vegetation establishment a challenge.
   We analyzed regeneration of woody plant species in the first years of
   restoration in areas severely degraded by coal mining in the south
   Brazilian Atlantic rainforest. At the four restoration sites, we
   collected data on cover of the herbaceous layer (including invasive
   grasses) and on abundance and richness of introduced trees and of
   spontaneously establishing woody plants. We also evaluated soil chemical
   features at all sites. We compared functional characteristics of the
   woody regeneration with nearby forest remnants (target communities) and
   evaluated the dynamics of regeneration over 3 years by principal
   coordinates analyses. The influence of biotic and abiotic variables for
   the regeneration of woody species was analyzed by partial redundancy
   analysis. We found high variation in community composition and structure
   among restored sites. Most of this variation was explained by variables
   related to soil chemistry and introduced trees. Over time, an increase
   in woody species establishment could be observed, and woody species
   communities appear to be at the start of trajectories toward target
   communities. Fertilization of soil, as commonly applied in restoration,
   seems to increase cover of exotic grasses, which clearly impedes the
   development of planted trees and woody species regeneration. Although
   the restoration of abandoned mining areas is a challenge due to the
   severe degradation, our results-despite the short period of
   observation-allow for the conclusion that restoration is possible, even
   with high initial costs. We highlight the importance of monitoring the
   initial process of restoration and of (re) defining intermediate goal
   and project targets, following an adaptive management approach.},

Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {8},
Month = {FEB 19},
Abstract = {Despite its negative impacts on the environment and biodiversity, tree
   plantations can contribute to biodiversity conservation in fragmented
   landscapes, as they harbor many native species. In this study, we
   investigated the impact of Eucalyptus plantations on the taxonomic and
   functional diversity of ant communities, comparing ant communities
   sampled in managed and unmanaged (abandoned for 28 years) Eucalyptus
   plantations, and native Atlantic rain forests. Eucalyptus plantations,
   both managed and unmanaged, reduced the functional diversity and
   increased the similarity between ant communities leading to functional
   homogenization. While communities in managed plantations had the lowest
   values of both taxonomic and functional ant diversities, ant communities
   from unmanaged plantations had similar values of species richness,
   functional redundancy and Rao's Q compared to ant communities from
   forest patches (although functional richness was lower). In addition,
   communities in unmanaged Eucalyptus plantations were taxonomically and
   functionally more similar to communities located in managed plantations,
   indicating that Eucalyptus plantations have a severe long-term impact on
   ant communities. These results indicate that natural regeneration may
   mitigate the impact of Eucalyptus management, particularly regarding the
   functional structure of the community (a diversity), although it does
   not attenuate the effects of long term homogenization in community
   composition (beta diversity).},

Abstract = {Changes in the vegetation of Brazilian Cerrado may occur over time.
   However, long-term dynamics are not fully understood yet, especially

   absence of periodic fires or grazing, Cerrado open formations (i.e.,
   grassland or savanna) tend to become denser due to WPE. Shrubby
   grassland cover assessed in 1987 disappeared in the following periods
   (from 30.0\% to 0.0\% in 2019) while forest formations increased (from
   7.0\% in 1987 to 11.0\% in 2019). Changes between 2005 and 2019 occurred
   within the stricto sensu cerrado subdivisions, with reduction of sparse
   cerrado (from 34.2\% to 7.7 \%) and an increase in dense cerrado (from
   6.9\% to 39.8 \%). Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) applied
   for similar periods indicates a progressive increase of values over time
   (from 1986 (0.61 +/- 0.10) to 2004 (0.65 +/- 0.06) and 2018 (0.78 +/-
   0.05)) and corroborates the WPE process. These patterns imply the loss
   of biodiversity in open plant formation. Another major consequence was
   the reduction of wetlands and possible impact on water supply. Such
   patterns are important to support plant management plans for the
   threatened Cerrado open plant formations.},

Title = {Estimating Double Cropping Plantations in the Brazilian Cerrado through
   PlanetScope Monthly Mosaics},
Journal = {LAND},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {12},

Abstract = {Farmers in the Brazilian Cerrado are increasing grain production by
   cultivating second crops during the same crop growing season. The
   release of PlanetScope (PS) satellite images represents an innovative
   opportunity to monitor double cropping production. In this study, we
   analyzed the potential of six PS monthly mosaics from the 2021/2022 crop
   growing season to discriminate double cropping areas in the municipality
   of Goiatuba, Goias State, Brazil. The four multispectral bands of the PS
   images were converted into normalized difference vegetation index
   (NDVI), enhanced vegetation index (EVI), green-red normalized difference
   index (GRNDI), and textural features derived from the gray-level
   co-occurrence matrix (GLCM). The ten most important combinations of
   these attributes were used to map double cropping systems and other land
   use and land cover classes (cultivated pasture, sugarcane, and native
   vegetation) of the municipality through the Random Forest classifier.
   Training and validation samples were obtained from field campaigns
   conducted in October 2021 and April 2022. PS mosaic from February 2022
   was the most relevant data. The overall accuracy and Kappa index of the
   final map were 92.2\% and 0.892, respectively, with an accuracy
   confidence of 81\%. This approach can be expanded for mapping and
   monitoring other agricultural frontiers in the Cerrado biome.},

Abstract = {Tropical secondary forests (SF) play an important role in the global
   carbon cycle as a major terrestrial carbon sink. Here, we use
   high-resolution TerraClass data set for tracking land use activities in
   the Brazilian Amazon from 2004-2014 to detect spatial patterns and
   carbon sequestration dynamics of secondary forests (SF). By integrating
   satellite lidar and radar observations, we found the SF area in the
   Brazilian Amazon increased from approximately 22 Mha (10(6) ha) in 2004
   to 28 Mha in 2014. However, the expansion in area was also accompanied
   by a dynamic land use activity that resulted in about 50\% recycling of
   SF area annually from frequent clearing and abandonment. Consequently,
   the average age of SF remained less than 10 years (age similar to 8.2
   with one standard deviation of 3.2 spatially) over the period of the
   study. Estimation of changes of carbon stocks shows that SF accumulates
   approximately 8.5 Mg ha(-1) year(-1) aboveground biomass during the
   first 10 years after clearing and abandonment, 4.5 Mg ha(-1) year(-1)
   for the next 10 years followed by a more gradual increase of 3 Mg ha(-1)
   year(-1) from 20 to 30 years with much slower rate thereafter. The
   effective carbon uptake of SF in Brazilian Amazon was negligible (0.06
   +/- 0.03 PgC year(-1)) during this period, but the interannual
   variability was significantly larger (+/- 0.2 PgC year(-1)) If the SF
   areas were left to grow without further clearing for 100 years, it would
   absorb about 0.14 PgC year(-1) from the atmosphere, partially
   compensating the emissions from current rate of deforestation in the
   Brazilian Amazon.},

Abstract = {Euterpe edulis Mart. (Arecaceae) is a threatened palm tree of the
   Brazilian Atlantic Rainforest understory with fundamental importance for
   the restoration of degraded forest environments. We assessed the leaf
   gas exchange, growth and survival of E. edulis seedlings transplanted at
   three different forest sites (S1, S2 and S3) in the same area in which
   cocoa trees had been cultivated in a rustic agroforestry system.
   Measurement was carried out during the first year after seedling
   transplantation. The sites were characterised according to canopy
   openness (CO) and total daily photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD).
   Average CO and PPFD values were 13.3\%, 8.0\% and 6.7\%, and 3.34, 2.79
   and 0.62 mol m(-2) d(-1) for S1, S2 and S3, respectively. A progressive
   decline in seedling survival was observed in all sites throughout the
   experiment. At 387 d after planting, survival at S1, S2 and S3 was 57\%,
   44\% and 37\%, respectively. The gross light-saturated photosynthetic
   rate (A(max)), leaf area and plant biomass were significantly higher (P
   < 0.05) in S1 and S2 when compared with S3. The values of dark
   respiration rate (R-d) and photosynthetic compensation irradiance (I-c)
   were sufficiently low for a positive carbon balance. Notwithstanding,
   the interpretation of results of microclimate variables together with
   leaf gas exchange and growth variables indicated that seedlings at all
   sites were in a suboptimal condition to achieve A(max), which is
   probably the main cause of the dramatic decline in the seedlings'
   survival throughout the first year after transplantation. From a
   practical point of view, if the values of CO and PFD are lower than 10\%
   and 3 mol m(-2) d(-1), respectively, it is suggested that the
   transplanting of E. edulis seedlings to the understory of abandoned
   agroforestry systems be accompanied by cultural practices, such as the
   thinning and pruning of tree tops.},

Abstract = {Seed predators and dispersers may drive the speed and structure of

   seed predation in 4 plant species in a successional gradient on a

   rather than dispersed; (2) rates of seed predation vary by habitat,
   season, and species; (3) seed size, shape, and hardness do not affect
   the probability of being depredated. Rodents were responsible for 70\%
   of seed predation and were negligible (0.14\%) seed dispersers, whereas
   ants were responsible for only 2\% of seed predation and for no
   dispersal. We detected seasonal and habitat effects on seed loss, with
   higher seed predation occurring during the wet season and in old-growth
   forests. In the absence of predators regulating seed-consumer
   populations, the densities of these resilient animals explode to the
   detriment of natural regeneration and may reduce diversity and carrying

Volume = {174},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Mining is one of the main economic activities in the Amazon region,
   contributing substantially to the economy of countries that share its
   territory. This activity, however, brings environmental aftermaths as
   vegetation suppression, soil destruction, hydrological instability, and
   faunal displacement, making restoration of degraded ecosystems a
   challenge. In this sense, the objective of our study was to present the
   economic importance, the main restoration methods, and the bottlenecks
   to obtain successful restoration trajectories in degraded areas by
   industrial mining in the Amazon. We listed eight possible relevant
   procedures for successful restoration after mining and discussed
   worldwide adopted restoration methods such as seedling planting,
   inducing natural regeneration, hydroseeding, and nucleation. Despite the
   great development of restoration methods after mining, there are still
   barriers to obtain inputs, which include seedlings, and qualified labor
   to plan and develop restoration projects. These issues come in addition
   to operational restrictions, technical incapacity, deficient or
   inflexible legal basis, and lack of law enforcement. We suggest the
   selection of key species for planting, associated with arbuscular
   mycorrhizal fungi and biochar, establishment of lists with ecological
   indicators and reference values, usage of organic waste, and monitoring
   through unmanned aerial vehicles with high sensors resolution to correct
   revegetation failures and estimate aboveground biomass and carbon.},

Volume = {108},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Coastal thicket vegetation in Brazil (restinga) is characterized by
   three distinct microhabitats - thicket center, thicket edge, and open
   area - and the spatial pattern of seed dispersal varies among them. The
   objectives of this study were to differentiate microhabitats,
   considering dispersal syndromes and growth forms, and to determine the
   existence of seasonality in the seed dispersal for this ecosystem where
   the climate is seasonal. Seeds were monthly captured by seed traps
   during 24 months. They were counted, identified and dispersal syndromes
   and growth forms were determined. Number of seeds was low and most
   species were under-represented in the seed rain. Abundance, richness,
   and diversity of seed rain were substantially higher in both thicket
   microhabitats than in the open area, probably due to the combined
   effects of seed production and seed retention in thickets, resulting in
   a non-random aggregated pattern of seed dispersal. Anemochory and
   zoochory were high in both thicket microhabitats, but in the open area
   anemochory was predominant. Herbs and shrubs contributed the greatest
   number of seeds and species in all three microhabitats. Our results
   showed a general aseasonal seed rain pattern at the community level, in
   contrast to the seasonal climate in this region. We conclude that seed
   dispersal face limitations in the plant community, natural regeneration
   potential is restricted, and degraded thicket vegetation will not be
   able to naturally regenerate the original biodiversity. Our findings
   considerably increase knowledge on the seed rain process at the
   community level and may contribute to the conservation and restoration
   in sandy coastal ecosystems.},

Abstract = {Swidden cultivation is one of the most widespread agricultural systems
   in the tropics. Due to socioeconomic changes, swiddens are either
   abandoned, substituted for other agricultural systems, or intensified.
   In the region of the middle Amazon river, Brazil, the high market demand
   for cassava flour (farinha) combined with land scarcity is inducing
   agricultural intensification. We define agricultural intensification as
   an increase in the frequency of swidden-fallow cycles and a decrease in
   the fallow period. In this study, we evaluate the consequences of
   agricultural intensification for management practices and swidden
   productivity in one of the main cassava producing areas of the Brazilian
   Amazon. We used ethnographic and biophysical surveys to characterize the
   current management practices and to evaluate the effect of repeated
   swidden-fallow cycles within a short fallow period regime on swidden
   size, weed infestation and life-form composition, weeding effort and
   cassava productivity. Our results show that with repeated swidden-fallow
   cycles cassava yield decreases, weed cover increases and weed
   composition changes from a tree-dominated to a graminoid-dominated
   community. Such changes in the weed community result in increased
   weeding effort, to which farmers respond by cultivating smaller
   swiddens. Therefore, the ongoing agricultural intensification leads to
   lower swidden productivity and household income without ensuing clear
   benefits for farmers. Limited access to fertilizers, herbicides and
   technical assistance combined with the market demand for a single
   product hinders adaptation. Broadening market opportunities and
   improving technical assistance to farmers could raise the
   diversification of production and sources of income and guarantee higher
   resilience to the system. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {14},

Abstract = {Direct road mortality and the barrier effect of roads are typically
   identified as one of the greatest threats to wildlife. In addition,
   collisions with large mammals are also a threat to human safety and
   represent an economic cost to society. We documented and explored the
   effects of animal-vehicle crashes on human safety in Sao Paulo State,
   Brazil. We estimated the costs of these crashes to society, and we
   summarized the legal perspectives. On average, the Military Highway
   Police of Sao Paulo reported 2,611 animal-vehicle crashes per year
   (3.3\% of total crashes), and 18.5\% of these resulted in human injuries
   or fatalities. The total annual cost to society was estimated at R\$
   56,550,642 (US \$ 25,144,794). The average cost for an animal-vehicle
   crash, regardless of whether human injuries and fatalities occurred, was
   R\$ 21,656 (US \$ 9,629). The Brazilian legal system overwhelmingly
   (91.7\% of the cases) holds the road administrator liable for
   animal-vehicle collisions, both with wild and domestic species. On
   average, road administrators spent R\$ 2,463,380 (US \$ 1,005,051) per
   year compensating victims. The logical conclusion is that the Brazilian
   legal system expects road administrators to keep animals, both wild and
   domestic species, off the road. We suggest an improved coordination
   between the laws that relate to animal-vehicle collisions and human
   safety, and the process for environmental licenses that focusses on
   reducing collisions with wildlife and providing habitat connectivity. In
   addition, we suggest better management practices, raising awareness and
   social change with regard to abandoned domesticated animals including
   horses, cattle, and dogs. This should ultimately result in a road system
   with improved human safety, reduced unnatural mortality for both
   domestic and wild animal species, safe crossing opportunities for
   wildlife, and reduced monetary costs to society.},

Abstract = {We employed a biocultural approach to understand the dynamics of
   knowledge and use of natural resources associated with immaterial
   aspects of culture. We investigated how urbanization influences the
   richness of species known and used by ``Caboclinho `` practitioners, a
   carnivalesque manifestation of indigenous culture, which occurs in rural
   and urban areas of Northeast Brazil. We recorded a total of 103
   ethnospecies (75 plant and 28 animals) based on information obtained
   from 18 local experts between July 2016 and August 2018. There were no
   differences between rural and urban informants in the richness of
   ethnospecies they knew and they used; rural informants demonstrated
   greater knowledge of the use of wild resources, while knowledge of
   native resource use did not differ between rural and urban groups; the
   market is the main immediate source of natural resources for the groups
   of ``Caboclinhos `` that occur in the rural area. Informants from rural
   and urban areas had similar relationships with natural resources,
   contrary to what has been reported for the use of resources for human
   subsistence. The maintenance of this biocultural heritage in the urban
   context has been ensured by the ease of urban informants to maintain the
   functions performed by natural resources in this practice, without
   abandoning the use of plants and animals.},

Title = {Drivers of rural exodus from Amazonian headwaters},
Journal = {POPULATION AND ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {32},
Number = {2-3},
Pages = {137-176},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Rural-urban migration can have both positive and negative environmental
   consequences for tropical forests. Rural residents exert pressure on the
   environment through farming, fishing, and forest extraction, yet
   conversely, protecting rural livelihoods is often the motivation for
   conserving large areas of threatened forest. This research examines
   rural settlement within the Brazilian Amazon to shed light on the
   drivers of on-going rural exodus and its environmental implications.
   Specifically, we examine the relative importance of public service
   provision and natural resources in determining settlement patterns
   along, and rural-urban migration from, eight rivers in road-less regions
   of the Brazilian Amazon. Data include biophysical, social, and economic
   variables that were assessed in 184 riverine settlements along
   rural-urban gradients up to 740 km from the nearest urban center.
   Settlements were smaller upstream, and lacked key services such as
   schools and healthcare. We found that clustering of rural populations
   close to urban centers reflects the high costs of living in remote
   areas, despite abundant natural resources which previously justified
   migration to headwaters. Impeded dry-season navigability and transport
   costs restricted the flow of goods and services to and from remote
   areas, and transaction costs of trade exchange were higher upstream. A
   lack of school access was the main motivation for rural-urban migration
   and the abandonment of remote riverine settlements. A key policy
   implication is that while education services could provide a powerful
   tool to stabilize and support rural populations, delivery is challenging
   in remote areas and may also encourage further rural-urban migration in
   the longer term. Furthermore, river-dwellers in remote areas rarely
   visited remote urban centers, presumably because these journeys are too
   costly. We examine the implications of our findings for anti-poverty
   subsidies and payment for ecosystem services and conclude that transport
   costs required to receive payment could encourage further depopulation
   of remote areas.},

Abstract = {This work aimed at knowing and evaluating the florisitc composition, the
   strucuture and the diversity of the regenerating species in a gully at
   Itumirim, MG. The gully possesses an area of 0.9 ha and was subdivided
   into three sectors named as arms ``A{''}; ``B{''} and ``C{''}. For the
   structural survey of the vegetation the needle method was employed, i.
   e., 574 points distributed systematically across the three arms were
   sampled. Each spot was stratified on the terrain as related to a
   topographic gradient. The indicator species analysis (ISA) was used to
   give statistical support to the standards found. A florisitic survey was
   also conducted with the purpose of recording all the species of
   shrub-tree life form ocorring in the gully. Through the strucutural
   survey, it was found that the species of the group of ``grass-like!' and
   ``ferns{''} dominated widely all the sectors. The indicator species
   analysis performed for each of the arms pointed out that Ludwigia
   elegans (Cambess.) H. Hara presents high fidelity, and, therefore, can
   be regarded as an indicator of the sector slack for arm ``A{''} (p =
   0.002) the group of species which make up the guild ``ferns{''} was
   considered an indicator for the upper third of arm ``C{''} (p = 0.038).
   In the floristic survey concerning the species of shrub-tree life form,
   73 species were recorded in the three arms arms 73, distributed into 63
   genera and 33 botanic families. The families with highest diversities of
   species were Fabaceae, Asteraceae, Melastomataceae and Myrtaceae,
   standing for 46.6\% of the total of recorded species.},

Abstract = {Monitoring through good ecological indicators is still a challenge in
   assessing the results of ecological restoration in Brazil. In this
   sense, the aim of this work was to evaluate ecological indicators of the
   restoration process by applied nucleation implanted two years and seven
   years ago in the south of Brazil. A total of twenty 5 m x 5 m plots were
   evaluated in each area, arranged systematically under the nuclei. All
   shrub-tree individuals with height greater than 30 cm were counted and
   identified. The species were classified according to the dispersion
   syndrome and shade tolerance. Shannon's diversity and Pielou's evenness
   indices were calculated. Canopy coverage was verified by a convex
   spherical densiometer. Analysis of variance (p<0.05) were used to
   compare floristic composition, structure and function group indicators
   between areas. We adjusted simple linear regression models between the
   area occupation of the nucleus and the richness and number of
   individuals of natural regeneration to verify the nuclei expansion. The
   results showed greater richness, diversity and canopy coverage
   percentage in the area with applied nucleation from seven years. There
   was a significant difference for composition, structure and function
   group indicators. The simple linear regression model for the nucleus
   area as a function of the number of individuals was significant
   (p<0.05). We concluded that the nuclei implanted seven years ago are
   being effective for ecological restoration. The post-implantation
   chronological period should be considered as a variable of influence on
   the effectiveness of the restoration.},

Abstract = {Bird abundances on a small island (150 ha) near the mainland of northern
   North Island New Zealand were studied using a standardised, longitudinal
   survey through 38 years (1988-2020), a period during which habitat
   restoration, reintroductions of five native bird species, and control of
   rats (Rattus spp.) and stoats (Mustela ermina) occurred. We estimated
   time-series abundances of 33 bird species and found substantial
   population shifts shared by many taxa. The unique data set from this
   restoration project showed that: (1) more species and more individual
   birds were present at the end of the study than at the beginning; (2)
   rat control made an immediate and lasting difference, increasing
   population growth of the typical species 6\% per year; (3) boosting
   ecological succession by habitat conversion and habitat enrichment
   resulted in a long term population growth of many native bird species;
   (4) shifts in species composition are still ongoing 20 years after
   predator control, with both gradual, long-term increases, and declines.
   In particular, two endemic species, and popokotea (whitehead, Mohoua
   albicilla) proved robust competitors in a predator-free environment,
   increasing in abundance, while most non-native and many native species
   declined. These gradual, longer-term shifts became clear during
   ``maturation{''}, a period beginning about 13 years after predator
   control started.},

Abstract = {The environmental suitability of the property with the environmental
   legislation is a legal requirement today. The present work has as main
   objective to use environmental education as a tool to the process of
   adjusting the properties of the Family Agriculture of Rio Grande do Sul
   State to environmental legislation. In Rio Grande do Sul State, the
   majority of the properties are classified as Family Farming. It's main
   features are the small size of areas for exploration and crops,
   intensive land use, large production of income and use of hand labor per
   unit area and is a producer of staple foods consumed by the population.
   In terms of legislation, the Forestry Code is the principal law package
   acting on the properties of Family Farming. The Forest Code stipulates
   the main forms of environmental preservation of the Permanent
   Preservation Areas and Legal Reserves. These conservation areas have
   many functions for both the property and to society. The producer must
   comply with the dimensions imposed for these areas. To do so takes many
   forms such as netting, natural regeneration and, for example,
   restoration to the legal reserve and natural regeneration, planting
   native species and planting native species combined with natural
   regeneration. Agroforestry can be a solution in the
   restoration/remediation for Permanent Preservation Areas and Legal
   Reserves. Environmental education act as a catalyst in these processes
   leading information. Therefore, the family farmer can adapt itself and
   understand how they can cause or remedy the least possible damage to
   their production systems.},

Journal = {BIOTROPICA},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {46},
Number = {5},
Pages = {516-528},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Herbivory has been identified as a potent evolutionary force, but its
   ecological impacts have been frequently underestimated. Leaf-cutting
   ants represent one of the most important herbivores of the Neotropics
   and offer an interesting opportunity to address the role played by
   herbivorous insects through a perspective that embraces population- to
   ecosystem-level effects. Here we: (1) qualitatively summarize the
   multiple ways leaf-cutting ants interact with food plants and their
   habitats and elucidate the ultimate outcome of such interactions at
   multiple organization levels; (2) update our understanding of
   leaf-cutting ant-promoted disturbance regimes; and (3) examine potential
   ecological roles by leaf-cutting ants within the context of
   human-modified landscapes to guide future research agendas. First, we
   find that leaf-cutting ants show that some herbivorous insects are able
   to generate ecologically important disturbance regimes via non-trophic
   activities. Second, impacts of leaf-cutting ants can be observed at
   multiple spatio-temporal scales and levels of biological organization.
   Third, ecosystem-level effects from leaf-cutting ants are ecosystem
   engineering capable not only of altering the abundance of other
   organisms, but also the successional trajectory of vegetation. Finally,
   effects of leaf-cutting ants are context-dependent, species-specific,
   and synergistically modulated by anthropogenic interferences. Future
   research should examine how leaf-cutting ants respond to deforestation
   and influence remaining vegetation in human-modified landscapes. By
   promoting either heterogeneity or homogeneity, leaf-cutting ants operate
   not only as agricultural pests but also as ecological key players.},

Journal = {AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {84},
Number = {3},
Pages = {361-375},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {This paper compares the financial attractiveness of forest and
   agroforestry plantations promoted by external organizations with tree
   growing practices of Amazonian smallholders. Based on 80 case studies
   and interviews with 112 forestry professionals from Brazil, Bolivia,
   Peru and Ecuador, the paper characterizes the economic, environmental
   and structural implications, and identifies the respective financial
   costs and benefits. Six case studies provided data for in-depth
   financial analyses. The results showed that the expectations of
   externally promoted smallholder tree and agroforestry plantations were
   not met. Despite significant inputs, smallholders generated at best
   annual net incomes of US\$200-\$1,000 per ha from NTFP plantations, and
   up to US\$800-\$1,000 from timber plantations in the year of harvest.
   This corresponded to around one-third of the initially expected returns.
   Overall, only around 1\% of the smallholders participating in such
   initiatives managed to produce and commercialize any plantation
   products. Smallholders' practices of complementary tree growing in
   conjunction with agriculture and managing natural regeneration of timber
   and NTFP products were often underestimated by professionals. They
   required low input, didn't rely on external support, were highly
   flexible in risky environments, and some presented financial returns
   comparable to some well functioning plantations.},

Abstract = {Floodplains in the Amazon are areas of great economic, social and
   ecological importance. Occupation in these areas brings various impacts
   due to its complexity and fragility. This paper aims to analyze dynamics
   of change in land use and land cover in the floodplain of Lago Grande do
   Curuai, near Santarem city, in the state of Para. To that end,
   geotechnologies associated with landscape metrics and an analysis of two
   different geographic clippings of the region were used. The first
   geographic clipping covers the entire hydrographic basin, focusing on
   the analysis of the natural vegetation cover (dryland and lowlands); the
   second geographic clipping shows the area divided in six landscape
   zones, whose criteria are the productive systems and the characteristics
   of use of the region. We classified images from satellites Landsat 5 and
   7 from the years 1985, 1997 and 2014. Landscape metrics established
   patterns that facilitated the comparison between different times. In the
   first geographic clipping, metrics show a moderate dynamic in the
   period. Although there is a decrease in dry land forest areas, the class
   in which there is greater increase is the
   secondary/{''}capoeira{''}vegetation. There are increases in the pasture
   areas, the farmlands, however, remain stable; pasture and farming areas
   occur in a dispersed way in the territory and in small allotments; this
   dynamic revealed by classification indicates that cultivation areas are
   occupied by rotation, being occupied and abandoned over time. In the
   second geographic clipping, zones 3 and 4 concentrate most of the
   processes of replacing the natural vegetation cover by anthropic
   activities. The analysis in different geographic clippings shows the
   researched area has heterogeneous patterns of occupation in time and

Abstract = {The degraded areas in Southern Brazil are undergoing rapid conversion
   from abandoned fields into agroforestry system. Our focus was to
   investigate the impact of land use and soil properties on soil fauna and
   quality in an agroforestry system and a natural ecosystem. The
   agroforestry system had the presence of Cicadidae (0.1 ind trap(-1)),
   Diplura (0.01 ind trap(-1)), Gryllidae (0.2 ind trap(-1)), Gyrinidae
   (0.07 ind trap(-1)), and Larvae (0.3 ind trap(-1)), and it presents
   lower SOC (less 44.3\%) and higher total N (more 29.8\%) and P contents
   (more 68.8\%) when compared with the natural ecosystem. Richness and
   diversity declined (less than 16.3 and 31.8\%, respectively) with
   increasing soil pH. Natural ecosystem showed the greatest diversity (H'
   = 2.44) of soil fauna. A negative correlation was observed between
   diversity and soil pH (-0.91), and positive correlations among diversity
   and SOC (0.97), richness (0.88), and dominance (0.93). In conclusion,
   fauna abundance, precipitation, and soil pH played essential roles in
   soil quality through ecosystem services, habitat, and energy provision,
   which in turn promoted the entire soil food web. Thus, the findings in
   the agroforestry system and natural ecosystem help us to understand how
   land uses impact soil fauna, and soil quality.},

Abstract = {One of the most effective procedures in the evaluation of degraded areas
   has been the use of remote sensing. The aim of this work was to evaluate
   the temporal dynamics of the NDVI and rainfall in detecting the
   degradation of natural resources in a semi-arid region of Brazil. The
   area under study is located to the west of the district of Taud, in the
   State of Ceara, with a predominance of shrub-like caatinga forest.
   Rainfall data was obtained from FUNCEME. Ten images (dry season) were
   acquired from a 27-year historical series (1985-2011) from the
   TM/LANDSAT5 sensor, later converted to surface reflectance using the
   FLAASH/ENVI extension; NDVI indices were obtained and divided into six
   classes corresponding to land usage and occupation. The mean values of
   the NDVI classes were submitted to statistical analysis and compared by
   T-test (p<0.05) and the Pearson correlation matrix. It was found that in
   the years with rainfall above the historical average (1985-1993 and
   19962004) there was a significant increase in degraded areas,
   represented by low values for the NDVI (between 0 and 0.4), due to more
   land being used for subsistence farming. However, during periods of
   drought (1993-1996 and 2004-2011), the opposite behaviour was seen,
   characterised by the natural regeneration of the woody stratum due to
   agricultural areas being abandoned; behaviour that was evidenced by
   increases of up to 1,807\% in the moderately high class of the NDVI
   (between 0.6 and 0.8). The spatial and temporal dynamics of the NDVI and
   the rainfall therefore played a part in detecting evidence of the
   process of degradation of the caatinga biome in an area of the district
   of Taud, in the State of Ceara.},

Abstract = {A constant in the business world is the frequent movement of customers
   joining or abandoning companies' services and products. The customer is
   one of the company's most important assets. Reducing the customer
   abandonment rate has become a matter of survival and, at the same time,
   the most efficient way to maintain the customer base, since the
   replacement of dropouts by new customers costs, on average, 40\% more.
   Aiming to mitigate the churn (customer evasion) phenomenon, this study
   compared predictive models to discover the most efficient method to
   identify customers who tend to drop out in the context of a banking
   organization. A literature review of related works on the subject found
   the neural network, decision tree, random forest and logistic regression
   models were the most cited, and thus the models were chosen for this
   work. Quantitative analyses were carried out on a sample of 200,000
   credit operations, with 497 explanatory variables. The statistical
   treatment of the data and the developments of predictive models of churn
   were performed using the Orange data mining software. The most
   expressive results were achieved using the random forest model, with an
   accuracy of 82\%.</p>},

Abstract = {Termites play an important role in the carbon cycling of several
   ecosystems. Part of this C is directed to the formation of nests or
   mounds, but few published estimations have been made of the proportions
   of this C in relation to those in the vegetation and/or in the litter.
   The dynamics of C of Constrictotermes cyphergaster nests, in the driest
   part of caatinga, in semiarid northeast Brazil, was calculated
   considering all present, formed and abandoned nests in 1 ha, for two
   years. Carbon concentrations were determined from samples taken from the
   core and the external layer of nests. Total aboveground biomasses of
   trees and shrubs in the 1 ha were estimated by allometric equations. C
   concentrations were lower in the external layer (24-33 g kg(-1)) than in
   the nest cores (38-76 g kg(-1)). The stock of C in the nests of the
   sampled ha was 61.5 kg, which represents about 0.6\% of that in the
   plant aboveground biomass (10.25 Mg C ha(-1)). The C in the annual
   formation and abandonment of nests (10.2 kg ha(-1) year(-1))
   corresponded to 16\% of the stock of C in the nests, 1.1\% of the carbon
   in the annual litter production (925 kg C ha(-1) year-1) and 3.1\% of
   the non-leaf litter. Although lower than the few values reported for
   more humid areas, these proportions indicate that C. cyphergaster nest
   formation contributes to C cycling in this very dry semiarid caatinga
   site. (c) 2010 Elsevier BM. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The Late Quaternary climate in Amazonia is an issue still open to
   debate, with hypotheses varying from alternate dry and wet episodes to
   stable climate with undisturbed rainforest. We approach this question
   using C-13, C/N, and, to a lesser extent, N-15 from deposits derived
   from four cores, with the results combined with published pollen data
   from two of these cores. These data were analyzed within the context of
   radiocarbon dating, which revealed ages ranging from 42.8-41.8 to
   2.3-2.2 cal ka BP. Fluvial channel and floodplain deposits with
   freshwater phytoplankton recorded a trend of wet climate with dry
   episodes before similar to 40 cal ka BP, followed by humid and cold
   climate until the Last Glacial Maximum, with intensified aridity towards
   the end of the Late Pleistocene. Peaks of increased contributions in C-4
   land plants in the mid- to late Holocene were not synchronous and have
   no correspondence with Amazonian Holocene dry episodes, being due to
   sedimentary processes related to fluvial dynamics during the
   establishment of herbaceous fields on abandoned depositional sites.
   Thus, the climate remained wet in the Holocene, which would have favored
   the expansion of the Amazonian rainforest as we see today.},

Abstract = {The historical focus in research and policy on forest restoration and
   temperate ecosystems has created misunderstandings for the restoration
   of tropical and subtropical old-growth grassy biomes (TGB). Such
   misconceptions have detrimental consequences for biodiversity, ecosystem
   services, and human livelihoods in woodlands, savannas, and grasslands
   worldwide. Here, we demystify TGB restoration myths to promote a
   positive agenda to increase the likelihood of success of ambitious
   landscape-scale restoration goals of nonforest ecosystems. The 10 TGB
   restoration myths are: (1) grasslands originate from degraded forests,
   (2) tree cover is a reliable indicator of habitat quality, (3) planting
   trees is always good for biodiversity and ecosystem services, (4)
   grasslands are biodiversity-poor and provide few ecosystem services, (5)
   enhancing plant nutrition is needed in restoration, (6) disturbance is
   detrimental, (7) techniques used to restore temperate grasslands also
   work for TGB, (8) grasslands represent early stages of forest
   succession, (9) grassland restoration is only about grasses, and (10)
   grassland restoration is fast. By demystifying TGB restoration, we hope
   that policymakers, scientists, and restorationists come to understand
   and embrace the value of these ecosystems and are motivated to establish
   policies, standards, indicators, and techniques that enhance the success
   of TGB restoration. We must abandon misperceptions and misunderstandings
   of TGB ecology that result in ill-conceived policies and build an

   pioneers},
Journal = {FLORA},
Year = {2003},
Volume = {198},
Number = {6},
Pages = {436-443},
Abstract = {Two pioneer woody plant species with differential growth habits,
   Cecropia latiloba and Senna reticulata, form monospecific stands during
   secondary succession in Amazonian floodplains. The `fugitive strategy'
   of Cecropia latiloba enables vertical evasion from competition by
   continuous height growth without branching. This establishment strategy
   is aided by high submergence tolerance. In contrast to this, the
   `possessive' Senna reticulata shows fast height growth only in the first
   non-flooded period, with extreme lateral branching and effective shading
   of competitors. This strategy is efficient only on higher elevations in
   the flooding gradient where complete submergence does not occur and on
   sites with supposedly high nutrient availability. The present study
   describes the two establishment strategies for floodplain pioneers based
   on structural, physiological and reproductive characteristics of the two
   species, measured in the lower Rio Solimoes/Amazon River, Brazil, and in
   experiments performed at the INPA (Amazon Research Institute, Manaus).
   Despite several traits shared by the two species (many small seeds, high
   germination rates, high CO2-assimilation, fast initial growth, low
   maximum age, wood with high increments and low density), most
   physiognomic, structural and reproductive traits indicate two distinct
   establishment strategies which represent two extremes within a continuum
   of possible growth habits, and emphasize that also in ecosystems which
   have adverse growth conditions with prolonged flooding of up to 230 days
   every year and a water column of more than 10 m, the guild of pioneer
   trees does not necessarily form a homogeneous group.},

Month = {JUN 11},
Abstract = {A new Sciophilinae-Azana atlantica, sp. n. - is described from the
   Atlantic Forest in southeastern Brazil. The species has a number of
   distinctive apomorphic features, including loss of the mid ocellus,
   reduced mouthparts, Sc short and incomplete, first section of Rs
   missing, r-m elongated, longitudinal in position, aligned with the
   second section of Rs ( R-5), unforked medial and cubital veins, R-4
   missing, M-4 entirely absent, gonostyle triangular, with an inner row of
   elongated spines and a basal, digitiform inner projection. Some of these
   features are shared with other genera of the Azana-group of
   Sciophilinae. The shape of the scutum and the strong spines on the
   gonostyle make it clear that the species belongs in Azana, despite the
   features that are distinctive from the remaining species in the genus.
   There are ten species described in Azana to date, from United States,
   Europe, Sri Lanka, Canary Islands, tropical Africa and Baltic amber.
   This is the first Neotropical species belonging to the genus. The
   complete loss of M-4 and the separated gonocoxites suggest that Azana
   atlantica, sp. n. forms a monophyletic group with the Afrotropical
   species of the genus. Azana, Morganiella, Neoaphelomera, Neotrizygia,
   and Trizygia are shown to compose a small clade within the Azana-group
   of genera. The division of the genus into two subgenera - A. ( Azana)
   and A. ( Jugazana) - most probably renders A. ( Azana) paraphyletic and
   it is suggested that this should be for the time being abandoned.},

Abstract = {Bahia state harbours an immense diversity of plant species with several
   cases of endemism, especially in the savanna wetlands, typical
   ecosystems where most Lentibulariaceae representatives occur. In this
   context, we aimed to improve the characterization of these savanna
   wetlands in terms of species richness of Lentibulariaceae, their
   phytogeographic patterns, endemism, forms of rarity, threats to their
   habitats, and conservation efforts. Herein we present the synopsis of
   the 42 species of Lentibulariaceae that occur in Bahia state, providing
   short diagnostic characterization, photographs of living specimens,
   updated geographic distribution displayed in maps, new records, and
   discussion concerning phytogeographic patterns, endemism, rarity,
   habitat characterization and current scenario of threats and
   conservation. Our results show a disjunct distribution and similarity in
   Lentibulariaceae species composition between savanna wetlands,
   corroborating previous hypotheses of vegetation connections during
   moister climatic conditions in the past. Moreover, differences in

Abstract = {Anthropic pressure has caused several changes in the environment, such
   as habitat loss and fragmentation. One effective way to evaluate its
   effects on population genetics is to monitor populations through time.
   We aimed to characterize the population genetics of six plant species at
   two different times (cohorts). We asked (1) if populations show genetic
   divergence between cohorts, (2) if any significant changes are present
   between the genetic index of cohorts and, if so, (3) whether such
   changes are related to the adult cohort fixation index. To address these
   questions, we studied 61 populations of 50 adult and 50 seedling
   individuals genotyped with allozyme markers. We calculated allelic
   richness (Ar), observed (Ho) and expected heterozygosity (He), and
   fixation index (f) for each population cohort; and pairwise F-ST between
   cohorts. Seedlings were genetically similar to the adults (mean pairwise
   F-ST = 0.014). No difference was found in the proportion of populations
   that showed increases and decreases of the genetic indexes over cohorts,
   except f, for which more populations showed a decrease. Adult fixation
   index had a correlation with Ho (r = 0.507, p = 3.10(-5)) and He (r = -
   0.247, p = 0.055). A mean test between cohorts revealed the maintenance
   of high f values in Araucaria angustifolia and Ocotea catharinensis, as
   well as a significant decrease in He of Euterpe edulis, species widely
   explored in the past. Although we only studied two cohorts, general
   trends and significant changes were detected, which could be important
   in the conservation of those six species.},

Title = {Effects of land-use change on soil nutrient dynamics in Amazonia},
Journal = {ECOSYSTEMS},
Year = {2001},
Volume = {4},
Number = {7},
Pages = {625-645},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Over the past several decades, the conversion of native forest to
   agricultural land uses has accelerated across the Amazon Basin. Despite
   a growing body of research on nutrient dynamics in Amazonian primary
   forest and forest-derived land uses, the effects of widespread land-use
   change on nutrient contents and cycles in soil and vegetation are not
   well understood. We reviewed over 100 studies conducted in Amazonia over
   the past 40 years on nutrient dynamics in natural forests and
   forest-derived land uses (pasture, shifting cultivation, and tree
   plantations). Our objectives were to compare soil data from land uses
   across Amazonia and identify any gaps in our present knowledge that
   might offer direction for future research. Specifically, by analyzing
   data we tested the following five widely cited hypotheses concerning the
   effects of land-use change on soil properties compiled from 39 studies
   in multifactorial ANOVA models; (a) soil pH, effective cation exchange
   capacity (ECEC), and exchangeable calcium (Ca) concentrations rise and
   remain elevated following the slash-and-burn conversion of forest to
   pasture or crop fields; (b) soil contents of total carbon (C), nitrogen
   (N), and inorganic readily extractable (that is, Bray, Mehlich I, or
   resin) phosphorus (P-i) decline following forest-to-pasture conversion;
   (c) soil concentrations of total C, N, and P-i increase in secondary
   forests with time since abandonment of agricultural activities; (d) soil
   nutrient conditions under all tree-dominated land-use systems (natural
   or not) remain the same; and (e) higher efficiencies of nutrient
   utilization occur where soil nutrient pools are lower. Following the
   conversion of Amazonian forest to pasture or slash-and-burn agriculture,
   we found a significant and lasting effect on soil pH, bulk density, and
   exchangeable Ca concentrations. Unlike the other three land uses
   studied, concentrations of extractable soil P-i were equally low in both
   forest and pastures of all age classes, which demonstrates that
   postburning pulses in soil P-i concentration following a slash-and-burn
   decrease rapidly after forest-to-pasture conversion, perhaps due to
   accumulation in organic P fractions. Neither the concentrations nor the
   contents of total C and N appeared to change greatly on a regionwide
   basis as a result of forest-to-pasture conversion, but surface soil C:N
   ratios in 5-year-old pastures were significantly higher than those in
   older pastures, suggesting changes in the soil concentrations of at
   least one of these elements with time after pasture creation. Pasture
   soils did have higher total C and N concentrations than land uses such
   as annual cropping and secondary forest fallow, indicating that soil C
   and N maintenance and/or accumulation following forest conversion may be
   greater in pastures than in these other two land uses. The low
   concentrations of C and N in shifting cultivation soils appear to
   persist for many years in secondary forests regenerating from abandoned
   crop fields, suggesting that the recuperation of soil losses of C and N
   resulting during no-input annual cropping is slower than previously
   thought. Soil C, N and P concentrations were strongly related to clay
   content. Across all land uses, efficiencies of N, P, and Ca use
   (estimated as the inverse of litterfall N, P, and Ca contents) were not
   related to the sizes of their soil pools.
   More work is needed to test and standardize P extraction procedures that
   more accurately reflect plant availability. Few studies have been
   conducted to determine the role of organic P fractions and dissolved
   organic N (DON) in the elemental cycles of both natural and managed
   systems in this region. In general, we recommend further study of annual
   and perennial cropping systems, as well as more detailed examination of
   managed pastures and fallows, and secondary forests originating from
   various disturbances, since the intensity of previous land use likely
   determines the degree of soil degradation and the rate of subsequent
   secondary regrowth.},

   applications on yield of sugar cane and soil carbon and nitrogen stocks
   on a plantation in Pernambuco, NE Brazil},

Abstract = {Since the 1970s the area under sugarcane in Brazil has increased from 2
   million to over 5 million ha (M ha), and it is expected to pass the 7 M
   ha mark in 2007. More than half of the cane is harvested to produce
   bioethanol as a fuel for light vehicles. The distilleries produce
   approximately 13 L of distillery waste (vinasse) for each litre of
   ethanol produced. In the 1980s there was considerable concern over the
   long-term effects of the disposal of this material (containing about 1\%
   carbon and high in K) on cane yields if it was applied to the field. At
   the same time there was a growing movement to abandon the practice of
   pre-harvest burning and some research was showing that some Brazilian
   varieties of sugar cane were able to obtain significant contributions of
   N from plant-associated biological nitrogen fixation (BNF). For these
   reasons an experiment was installed on a cane plantation in the state of
   Pernambuco, NE Brazil to investigate the long-term effects of vinasse
   and N fertiliser additions and the practice of pre-harvest burning on
   crop and sugar yield, soil fertility parameters, N balance and soil C
   stocks. The results showed that over a 16-year period, trash
   conservation (abandonment of burning) increased cane yields by 25\% from
   a mean of 46 to 58 Mg ha(-1). Vinasse applications (80 m(3) ha(-1)
   crop(-1)) increased mean cane and sugar yield by 12 to 13\% and the
   application of 80 kg N ha(-1) as urea increased cane yields by 9\%, but
   total sugar yield by less than 6\% (from 7.0 to 7.4 Mg ha(-1) crop(-1)).
   The total N balance for the soil/plant system when only the surface 20
   cm of the soil was considered was positive in plots where no N
   fertiliser was added. However, the data indicated that during the 16
   years of the study considerable quantities of soil organic matter were
   accumulated below 20 cm depth such that the N balance considering the
   soil to 60 cm depth was strongly positive, except where N fertiliser was
   added. The data indicated that there were considerable BNF inputs to the
   system, which was consistent with its low response to N fertiliser and
   low N fertiliser-use-efficiency. There were no significant effects of
   vinasse or urea addition, or trash conservation on soil C stocks,
   although the higher yields proportioned by trash conservation had
   potentially significant benefits for increased mitigation of CO2
   emissions where the main use of the cane was for bioethanol production.},

Abstract = {Large fish are often the most effective seed dispersers, but they are
   also the preferred target for fisheries. We recently started to
   comprehend the detrimental impacts of the extirpation of large
   frugivorous fish species on natural forest regeneration, but we lack a
   general understanding of how intraspecific size-selective harvest
   affects fish-fruit mutualism. Our literature review demonstrated that
   large individuals within populations positively affect diverse aspects
   of seed dispersal, from consuming a higher diversity of seeds to
   enhancing germination. Furthermore, we filled a research gap by studying
   how individual size variations within two small frugivorous fish species
   (<16 cm) affect seed dispersal in flooded savannas. Even within
   small-bodied species, large individuals swallow a higher number of
   intact seeds, but not necessarily a higher proportion. Overall, our
   results demonstrate the disproportional role of large-bodied individuals
   as key seed dispersers in flooded habitats. Consequently, fishing-down
   within both large- and small-bodied species can negatively affect seed
   dispersal and natural regeneration in overfished wetlands.},

Abstract = {Marajo Island shows an abundance of paleochannels easily mapped in its
   eastern portion, where vegetation consists mostly of savannas. SRTM data
   make possible to recognize paleochannels also in western Marajo, even
   considering the dense forest cover. A well preserved paleodrainage
   network from the adjacency of the town of Breves (southwestern Marajo
   Island) was investigated in this work combining remote sensing and
   sedimentological studies. The palimpsest drainage system consists of a
   large meander connected to narrower tributaries. Sedimentological
   studies revealed mostly sharp-based, fining upward sands for the
   channelized features, and interbedded muds and sands for floodplain
   areas. The sedimentary structures and facies successions are in perfect
   agreement with deposition in channelized and floodplain environments, as
   Suggested by remote sensing mapping, The present Study shows that this
   paleodrainage was abandoned during Late Pleistocene, slightly earlier
   than the Holocene paleochannel systems from the east part of the island.
   Integration of previous studies with the data available herein supports
   a tectonic origin, related to the opening of the Par River along fault
   lineaments. This would explain the disappearance of large, north to
   northeastward migrating channel systems in Southwestern Marajo Island,
   which were replaced by the much narrower, south to southeastward flowing
   modern channels.},

Abstract = {Forests provide a wide variety of ecosystem services and international
   conventions and national policies for climate change mitigation and
   biodiversity conservation recommend forest protection and restoration.
   However, global forest cover continues to decline, and recent evidence
   suggests deforestation rates are accelerating. Against this background
   the area of planted forests has increased globally. Recognizing the
   substantial potential of well-managed forest plantations, the new
   generation plantations (NGP) platform was launched in 2007. NGP
   encourages well-managed planted forests in the right places to conserve
   biodiversity and meet human needs. Here we describe the NGP approach and
   analyze data and information from NGP participants and others over 10
   years. This shows that NGP participants are responsible for c.11.1
   million ha of land, much of it previously degraded or abandoned; 43\% is
   managed as timber plantations, with the remainder being wildlife
   reserves, restored natural forest, grassland and agriculture. NGP case
   studies illustrate a range of biodiversity, conservation and
   socio-economic achievements. These achievements, considered together
   with future projections of timber demand and of the land available for
   restoration to tree cover, demonstrate the potential of well-managed
   plantations to protect natural forests, provide timber, conserve
   biodiversity and mitigate climate change. The NGP concept works in a
   variety of countries and contexts; participants have shown that it is
   possible to produce timber while maintaining and enhancing ecosystems
   and contributing to socio-economic development. We present the case for
   forest production, restoration and mitigation/adaptation to limit
   climate and other environmental risks and to improve the resilience of

Abstract = {In Brazilian Amazonia there are 26 million hectares of degraded
   pastures. One of the causes of degradation is assumed to be alterations
   in soil structure that is partly determined by a reduction in soil
   macrofauna diversity. The objective of this case study was to identify
   the consequences of altered macrofaunal diversity on soil structure and
   hydrological processes. After forest clearing for pasture establishment,
   the diversity of soil macroinvertebrates decreased strongly.
   Tensiometric measurements showed the formation of a superficial
   groundwater table in a 4-year-old pasture (P4), and a deeper groundwater
   table in an abandoned pasture (Pa), that was an exceptional situation.
   The forest soil, in contrast, was almost never water-saturated due to
   its microaggregate structure. Once the pasture was abandoned, the soil
   macrofauna was dominated by a single earthworm species, Pontoscolex
   corethrurus, which may modify, in the course of a few years, the
   morphology and hydrological functioning of soils. By placing very wet
   castings on the pasture soil surface, P. corethrurus can form a
   continuous layer that is relatively impermeable to air and water.
   Although initially limited to the surface layer, the episodic conditions
   of water saturation and anoxia may also occur in deeper horizons,
   favoring the development of hydromorphic conditions, even though the
   surface soil structure may be regenerating due to the activity of other
   macrofaunal groups such as termites, after reduction of P. corethrurus
   populations. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The majority of deforested land in the Amazon Basin has become cattle
   pasture, making forest-to-pasture conversion an important contributor to
   the carbon (C) and climate dynamics of the region. However, our
   understanding of biogeochemical dynamics in pasturelands remains poor,
   especially when attempting to scale up predictions of C cycle changes. A
   wide range of pasture ages, soil types, management strategies, and
   climates make remote sensing the only realistic means to regionalize our
   understanding of pasture biogeochemistry and C cycling over such an
   enormous geographic area. However, the use of remote sensing has been
   impeded by a lack of effective links between variables that can be
   observed from satellites (e.g. live and senescent biomass) and variables
   that cannot be observed, but which may drive key changes in C storage
   and trace gas fluxes (e.g. soil nutrient status). We studied patterns in
   canopy biophysical-biochemical properties and soil biogeochemical
   processes along pasture age gradients on two important soil types in the
   central Amazon. Our goals were to (1) improve our understanding of the
   plot-scale biogeochemical dynamics of this land-use change, (2) evaluate
   the effects of pasture development on two contrasting soil types (clayey
   Oxisols and sandy Entisols), and (3) attempt to use remotely sensed
   variables to scale up the site-specific variability in biogeochemical
   conditions of pasturelands.
   The biogeochemical analyses showed that (1) aboveground and soil C
   stocks decreased with pasture age on both clayey and sandy soils, (2)
   declines in plant biomass were well correlated with declines in soil C
   and with available phosphorus (P) and calcium (Ca), and (3) despite low
   initial values for total and available soil P, ecosystem P stocks
   declined further with pasture age, as did a number of other nutrients.
   Spectral mixture analysis of Landsat imagery provided estimates of
   photosynthetic vegetation (PV) and non-photosynthetic vegetation (NPV)
   that were highly correlated with field measurements of these variables
   and plant biomass. In turn, the remotely sensed sum PV+NPV was well
   correlated with the changes in soil organic carbon and nitrogen, and
   available P and Ca. These results suggest that remote sensing can be an
   excellent indicator of not only pasture area, but of pasture condition
   and C storage, thereby greatly improving regional estimates of the
   environmental consequences of such land-use change.},

Abstract = {Oil exploration in the Amazon generally results in the creation of
   clearings. The traditional planting of tree seedlings in these remote
   degraded areas uses air and river transport of machinery and supplies
   resulting in a very expensive restoration process. To develop low cost
   nucleation techniques based on the application of locally available
   natural elements, allowing the natural regeneration of pioneer tree
   species, 5 treatments with 5 replicates, distributed in a 25 x 25 m
   Latin square, were tested, in the region of Urucu, Amazonas: T0
   (control), T1 (application of topsoil on fertilized seedbeds of manually
   scarified soil with sides protected using Cecropia logs), T2
   (application of topsoil on fertilized seedbeds without lateral
   protection), T3 (application of topsoil directly on the fertilized
   surface of the degraded area) and T4 (application of topsoil by
   hydroseeding on seedbed). The effects on apparent density and soil
   fertility, as well as on the density and growth of emerged seedlings,
   were evaluated. After 18 months, the T1, T2 and T3 treatments resulted
   in the establishment of 3, 1 and 1 individuals m(-2), respectively, with
   similar heights, originating from the topsoil. The T0 and T4 treatments
   had no seedling emergence. The soil density was higher in treatments
   (>1.3 g cm(-3)) compared to the forest (0.95 cm(-3)). While the
   application of fertilizer and limestone promoted an increase in the soil
   fertility in the treatments, the levels of nitrogen and organic matter
   were higher in the forest.},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Increased prices and political pressure are boosting illegal gold mining
   in the Brazilian Amazon, threatening forests, indigenous people, and
   conservation of biodiversity in protected areas. The rate of illegal
   mining deforestation increased more than 90\% from 2017 to 2020,
   reaching 101.7 km(2) annually in 2020 compared to 52.9 km(2) annually in
   2017. In that period, illegal mining deforestation rate grew more than
   the rate of clearing within mining leases. While formal mining is
   required to comply with environmental regulations, most small-scale or
   artisanal mining and especially illegal mining areas are abandoned after
   reserves are exhausted, without proper rehabilitation. Deforestation due
   to illegal mining is likely to increase in the next years, calling for
   coordination between local and regional policies as well as for
   strengthening and expanding international mechanisms to increase
   traceability of mineral supply chains with certification schemes to help
   to curb illegal mining.},

   Atlantic Forest reserve},
Journal = {TROPICAL CONSERVATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2014},

Abstract = {Reintroduction is an increasingly important tool to restore local
   extinctions and ecological interactions. Evaluating the success of
   reintroduction projects allows conservationists to learn from previous
   experience. Here we report on the reintroduction of agoutis, Dasyprocta
   leporina, to a Brazilian Atlantic Forest reserve in order to (1)
   determine the short-term status of the reintroduction; (2) describe and
   evaluate the management procedures that contributed to reintroduction
   success; and (3) identify the fruits and seeds consumed and buried by
   the agoutis, as an indication of their role in restoring ecological
   processes. We captured and tagged 21 adult individuals from a
   semi-captive population and reintroduced four males and seven females.
   One male died and almost all individuals lost weight (range=0-620 g;
   n=11) during quarantine (median=133 days; range=67-243 days; n=20). Six
   males and three females died, but the others gained weight during
   acclimatization (range=150-260 g; n=5). Individuals abandoned the food
   supplement up to 87 days after release, establishing home-ranges at
   least three times larger than in natural populations of agoutis. The
   estimated annual survival rate was 0.83, and 10 nature-born cubs were
   observed. The reintroduction was considered successful in the
   short-term. Among the main recommendations for future reintroductions,
   we suggest the reduction of quarantine and the maintenance of
   acclimatization periods, with structural improvements for both. Agoutis
   were seen eating fruits and seeds of 10 species and burying seeds of
   three of them. The buried seeds are from zoochoric large-seeded trees,
   thus enhancing recruitment in a disperser-impoverished forest.},

Abstract = {In this work the re-fixation of mobilized copper (Cu) that was released
   from a deactivated pilot Cu ore dressing plant in the tropical rain
   forest at Southeastern Amazon (Carajas) was studied. Samples of top
   soils, decay leaf litter deposited on soils, roots and leaves of
   standing biomass were taken for the determination of Cu concentration in
   order to evaluate the distribution of it between different environmental
   compartments. In the sampling points near to the now extinct plant,
   total Cu concentrations in the soil reached an average value of 2140 mu
   g g(-1) above the natural level of about 40 mu g g(-1), being that
   bioavailable Cu estimated by DTPA method varied from 1.9 to 20.7\% of
   this total. From the data was possible to calculate that the soil
   compartment is able to hold around 10 kg Cu/m(2) of ground. Roots of the
   standing biomass in that area hold around 17 g Cu/m(2), while the Cu
   content in leaves showed to be largely independent of the Cu level in
   the soil. Copper in the leaves was estimated as around 1 g/m(2) of
   ground area. In turn, the decay leaf litter deposited on soil can hold
   about 1.6 g Cu/m(2). The terrestrial system surrounding the abandoned
   pilot plant demonstrated great buffer capacity to retain mobile Cu
   released by anthropogenic activities in the area. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Title = {Propagation distance thresholds of woody Cerrado species in a pasture
   matrix},
Journal = {APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {25},
Number = {2},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Question: Is there a decrease in the richness, structural variables and
   composition similarity of woody Cerrado species with habitat-matrix
   distance, potentially influenced by soil compaction and propagule
   dispersal strategies in the pasture matrix?
   Location: We studied three landscapes of a pasture matrix in areas of
   the Cerrado biome in southwestern Sao Paulo, Brazil.
   Methods: We sampled 110 plots of 2 m x 2 m in the matrix, stratified in
   ranges perpendicular to the edge of the habitat, and 10 plots in the
   forest with no edge effect (60 m from the edge). We undertook soil
   sampling and collected information about the plants (taxonomy, height,
   circumference and establishment form by germination or resprouting). We
   defined habitat distance as the predictor variable for the following
   response variables: abundance, richness, establishment form, mean
   height, mean diameter at soil height and dispersal syndrome of the
   individuals sampled; in addition to the porosity and bulk density of the
   sampled soil.
   Results: We found significant differences between habitat and matrix for
   abundance, richness, mean height and germination number, but
   non-significant differences for resprouting number and mean diameter at
   soil height. There was no relationship regarding matrix-habitat
   distances for structural variables, and habitat species composition was
   similar only for the first 10 m distance from the habitat edge.
   Conclusion: Pasture did not prevent plant establishment but might act as
   an environmental filter. Pasture matrices modify the composition and
   diversity of the plant community compared with the Cerrado community.
   Pastures are dominated by resprouting, autochory and grassland species.
   Regenerating plants from the propagule bank of the matrix showed the
   potential for natural regeneration of Cerrado areas in pasture as a
   restoration strategy.},

Abstract = {Araucaria angustifolia is an extinction-threatened arboreal anemophilous
   conifer species native to Argentina and Brazil. A progressive scarcity
   of seeds that affects the natural regeneration and the development of
   new plantations has been observed. Taking into account that seed
   formation depends on pollination, pollen productivity was analyzed and
   the influence of the climate on the different reproductive phenophases
   evaluated. Two Argentine populations were compared: San Antonio (SA),
   located in the subtropical province of Misiones within its natural area,
   and 25 de Mayo (25M) in the temperate province of Buenos Aires.
   Gravimetric pollen traps were used during 2014, 2015, and 2016. It was
   found that the average of annual pollen productivity in 25M doubled that
   of SA (9440 and 5291 pollen cm(-2) year(-1)), and that seed productivity
   was 10 times higher in 25M with 104 seeds per cone compared to 12 in SA.
   High maximum summer temperatures were favorable to the induction of
   reproductive structures, low minimum temperatures in August favored the
   maturation of pollen grains, and precipitations in the main month of
   pollination reduced the amount of pollen. The weather in Buenos Aires
   Province is more favorable for the production of reproductive material.
   In this context, ex situ seed banks offer the chance of enhancing and
   restoring native forests and in situ reforestation. (C) 2018 Published

Journal = {AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF SOIL RESEARCH},
Year = {2005},
Volume = {43},
Number = {3},
Pages = {319-326},
Abstract = {Fire is commonly used to establish and maintain pastures in the Amazon.
   Fire is also known to induce soil water repellency but few published
   data exist for the humid tropics. The objectives of this study were to
   characterise the intensity and spatial variability of water repellency
   on previously burned pasture soils in the Amazon, and its effect on the
   nutrient status of the forage grass Brachiaria brizantha (Hochst.)
   Stapf. Surface soils of pastures and forests in north-western Mato
   Grosso, Brazil, were found to exhibit soil water repellency using MED
   and WDPT tests. Soil water repellency was found only within 0 - 0.01 m
   of the mineral soil surface, with soil below 0.01 m found to be
   hydrophilic in all cases.
   Spatial variability of repellency was high for both pasture and forest
   soils. For pasture soils, soil water repellency was strongest on
   recently burned pastures, which exhibited some extremely high values (
   MED > 8M). Repellency decreased rapidly with time following burning.
   Increasing soil water repellency was associated with decreasing N: P
   ratios of B. brizantha above-ground biomass (r(2) = 0.66, P= 0.004).
   These findings indicate that soil water repellency and pasture
   productivity are inversely related. Since pasture abandonment fuels
   continued deforestation, disrupting the processes causing pasture
   degradation may lead to more sustainable land use in the Amazon.},

Abstract = {Secondary vegetation (SV) from land abandonment is a common transition
   phase between agricultural uses following tropical deforestation. The
   impact of SV on carbon sequestration and habitat fragmentation across
   tropical forest frontiers therefore depends on SV dynamics and
   demographics. Here, we used time series of annual MapBiomas land cover
   data to generate the first estimates of SV extent, age, and net carbon
   uptake in the Brazilian Amazon between 1985 and 2017. SV increased over
   time, totaling 12 Mha in 2017, 44\% of which was <= 5 years old. Between
   1988 and 2017, 19.6 Mha of SV was cleared, adding 45.5\% to the area of
   primary deforestation detected by the Brazilian monitoring system
   (PRODES). Rates of SV loss have exceeded PRODES deforestation since
   2011. Based on the age and extent of gains and losses, SV was a small
   net carbon sink during this period (8.9 Tg C yr(-1)). As SV is not
   formally protected by national environmental legislation or monitored by
   PRODES, long-term benefits from SV in the Brazilian Amazon remain
   uncertain.},

Volume = {18},

Abstract = {Direct tree planting restoration systems are frequently used for
   recovering degraded tropical landscapes. Although manual planting tends
   to be more viable economically and logistically over small areas, in
   large restorations the use of agricultural equipment that optimizes
   effort is preferable. The aim of this study was to investigate the
   efficiency of the two native tree species planting systems-manual and
   mechanized-used in the restoration of Atlantic Forest landscapes that
   have been converted to pasture. In recently abandoned grazing areas with
   abundant cover of the exotic grass Brachiaria humidicola, 393 seedlings
   of 6 species were planted in two treatments: a mechanized planting
   system (soil prepared with a rotary tiller attached to a tractor;
   seedlings in polypropylene tubes) and a manual planting system (holes
   dug with a manual excavator; seedlings wrapped in polyethylene bags).
   After 12 months, survival (manual: 85\%; mechanized: 71\%) and growth
   rates (RGR(height): manual = 0.88 +/- 0.06 and mechanized = 0.98 +/-
   0.06 cm/cm; RGR(diameter): manual = 0.77 +/- 0.05 and mechanized = 0.86
   +/- 0.05 cm/cm) were high in both treatments, but no differences were
   found between them. Both planting systems proved efficient for planting
   native tree seedlings in pastures. The excellent results demonstrated in
   this study by the mechanized planting system are important because this
   cheap and readily available technique provides a good, but less
   frequently used, alternative to the manual planting system.},

Journal = {SCIENTIA FORESTALIS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {45},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The objective of this study was to assess the impacts of logging,
   firewood (DBH < 30 cm) and logs (DBH >= 30 cm), on the structure of the
   native understory vegetation in an area of legal reserve planted with
   Eucalyptus saligna Smith., abandoned for 40 years. The three analyzed
   treatments were: CCV - conventional harvesting with mechanized
   extraction for firewood and for logs; CIR1 - reduced impact harvesting
   with mechanized extraction for firewood and for logs; and CIR2 - reduced
   impact harvesting for firewood associated with animal extraction and
   with mechanized extraction for logs. The variables for studies on
   effects of vegetation structure were: a) three classes of tree damages:
   intact, damaged and dead; and b) remaining basal area (m(2). ha(-1)).
   The reduced impact harvesting treatments resulted in the lowest tree
   mortality rates, CIR1 of 32\% and CIR2 of 38\%. CIR1 differed
   statistically from CCV that presented 49\% of mortality. In the
   harvesting for firewood, the CIR2 that used animal traction in the
   logging caused a reduction of 10\% of initial basal area of the
   understory settlement, statistically differing from CIR1 and from CCV
   that used mechanical logging and resulted in a reduction of 26\% and
   30\% of basal area, respectively. After extraction of logs or the end of
   Eucalyptus wood harvesting, the CIR1 had the lowest basal area reduction
   rate of 26\%; statistically differing from CCV that caused 43\%
   reduction, while the CIR2 caused 30\% reduction. Therefore, it is
   possible to minimize the negative effects using mitigating impact
   techniques and, finally, the reduced impact harvesting systems are the
   best alternatives to logging in abandoned stands of Eucalyptus and they
   are a viable forest management to turn them into areas of legal reserve.},

Abstract = {Primate thanatology, or the study of primate responses to dying and
   death, has become increasingly relevant in recent years. However, the
   number of reports remains small and the quality of published records is
   highly variable. Here, we extend the literature on comparative
   thanatology with observations on a population of the northern muriqui
   (Brachyteles hypoxanthus). We compiled all seven cases of muriqui
   responses to dead, dying, or abandoned infants observed by trained
   researchers of the Muriqui Project of Caratinga between 1998 and 2020.
   Four different adult females were observed carrying their dead offspring
   (n = 4) and one of these females was also observed carrying her dead
   grand-offspring (n = 1). Five of the seven cases involved dead newborns,
   one involved a newborn abandoned by its mother on the forest floor, and
   one involved a 1.6-year-old infant that was visibly ill and died after
   its mother left it on the ground. Dead newborns were carried for 1-3
   days, and all cases occurred during the dry season months. No other
   age-sex classes were observed to interact with the dead or dying
   immatures. Our observations are consistent with hypotheses concerning
   the predominance of dead-infant carrying in other primates, and with the
   effects of climate on rates of corpse disintegration. They also show the
   value of long-term studies for obtaining and understanding anecdotal
   records of rare behavior.},

   burning, tillage and fallow-land were studied. Deforestation and tillage
   were responsible for a decreasing content and qualitative changes in
   organic matter; fulvic acid content first increased, then humic acid
   content decreased, giving rise to an increasing destruction of
   clay/organic complexes in the A horizon. As a result, a greater
   dispersion and migration of fine particles occurred, causing the
   obstruction of macropores and an increase in bulk density. Crop
   production decreased in two years, and the soil had to be abandoned. A
   secondary vegetation developed, and yielded organic residues which
   stimulated faunal activity. After three years under fallow, the above

Abstract = {Society has high expectations regarding the potential of ecological
   restoration to help confront the global environmental crisis, but the
   huge gap between restoration science and practice may undermine the
   recovery of native ecosystems in vast areas of degraded lands. In this
   paper, we explore the potential application of an innovation approach to
   bridge the gap between knowledge and action in restoration. The most
   promising innovation strategy for restoration is the adaptation of
   solutions developed in other fields of activity, for which market forces
   have historically supported programs of research and development.
   However, innovations in restoration may not rely only on technological
   took requiring high investments. Rather, there are many opportunities
   for making better use of the existing funds and for low-cost solutions
   if restoration science and practice are reframed and integrated. If
   research projects are conceived to promote a co-production of knowledge
   with end users, valuable solutions for restoration problems may arise
   without extra investments. For restoration practice, substantial
   advances in our capacity to revert degradation could be obtained by
   shifting the focus from plot-scale, expensive solutions to the promotion
   of natural regeneration in sites where it is ecologically viable and
   socioeconomically feasible. For capacity building, promising approaches
   include emulating other models of technology transfer, mainly those used
   in agriculture, and fostering the use of web-based solutions. For
   governance, we recommend the promotion of `'policy triggers{''} and
   better use of technology to obtain and integrate information. Finally,
   multi-stakeholder coalitions may contribute by linking these different
   fields of restoration and promoting the co-creation of solutions in
   complex socio-ecological systems. Large-scale restoration will not be
   achieved by the simple sum of small-scale projects implemented by
   traditional restoration approaches, so innovation can play an utmost
   role to fulfill the decades-old promise of restoration to reverse
   degradation at the landscape scale.},

   mixture mapping suggests a revised conceptual model of deforestation},
Journal = {REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {24},
Number = {4},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The Amazon Basin is experiencing large-scale land use conversion from
   primary forest to pasture. While several land cover datasets map cleared
   areas in the Amazon, the percent cover of woody vegetation (trees and
   shrubs) in cleared areas and its association with clearing age, soil
   type, and geology is poorly understood, despite its importance for
   carbon emissions, biodiversity, land-atmosphere interactions, and
   monitoring of pasture condition. We used temporal mixture analysis on
   Sentinel-2 imagery from 2019 to map woody vegetation cover on cleared
   areas in Rond \& ocirc;nia, Brazil. Binary woody vegetation masks were
   generated at 10-m resolution using a threshold of the evergreen
   endmember, with an overall accuracy of 84\%. The age of clearing for
   each pixel was calculated from MapBiomas (Sousa and Davis, Remote Sens
   Environ 247, 2020) with a 2019 base year. We find little evidence of
   large-scale abandonment of pasture: most (53\%) of the cleared area in
   2019 was ``clean pasture{''} (< 10\% woody vegetation cover), 34\% was
   ``dirty pasture{''} (10-90\% woody vegetation cover), 10\% was forest
   (90-100\% woody vegetation cover), and 3\% was early stage clearing (>
   10\% woody vegetation cover, cleared 1-5 years ago). Recently cleared
   areas (1-2 years) had high (60\%) woody vegetation cover, woody
   vegetation cover decreased with pasture age, and older pastures (20-34
   years) had consistently low woody vegetation cover (25\% on average).
   The commonly observed decrease in greenness with increasing clearing
   age, which is sometimes interpreted as decreasing grass health, was due
   in part to decreasing woody vegetation cover as pastures were gradually
   cleared over a decade. These results suggest modifications to existing
   conceptual models that describe clearing as a rapid process with high
   rates of secondary growth. We found a gradual and semi-permanent
   clearing of woody vegetation and proposed a revised conceptual model of
   deforestation dynamics.},

Abstract = {(1) Vegetation composition, structure, and biomass accumulation were
   studied on thirteen forest sites that had been cut and burned, used as
   cattle pasture, and then abandoned in the eastern Amazon near
   Paragominas, Para, Brazil. (2) The study sites were of two ages (two to
   four years and seven to eight years) and had received light, medium or
   heavy use for up to thirteen years. (3) Forest regenerated vigorously on
   sites of previously light use. Above-ground biomass accumulation
   averaged 10 t ha-1 y-1 or 80 t after eight years (roughly one-quarter of
   mature forest levels). Tree species richness was also high (about 20 per
   100 m2) and almost all species also occurred in native forest.
   Moderately grazed pastures also developed forest but biomass
   accumulation was only 5 t ha-1 y-1. Tree species richness was also lower
   than on light-use sites and there were fewer forest trees. Abandoned
   pastures subjected to heavy use had the least distinct patterns of
   succession. The single eight-year-old site was dominated by grasses and
   forbs with fewer than one tree per 100 m2 and an above-ground biomass
   accumulation of 0.6 t ha-1 y-1, a value only about 6\% of that found on
   light-use sites. (4) The light-use sites had significantly higher
   biomass and species richness in both age-classes than either moderate-
   or heavy-use sites. Site age was a good predictor of above-ground
   biomass accumulation on light- and moderate-use sites, but not on
   heavy-use sites. (5) These Amazon ecosystems generally can recover after
   large-scale pasture disturbances. Only where land has been used too
   intensively for long periods is reforestation uncertain, but probably
   less than 10\% of the pasture land in northern Para has degraded to this
   level. Nevertheless, the re-growth forest, regardless of pasture-use
   history, will not necessarily have the same characteristics of
   physiognomy or species composition as that originally occupying the
   site. Moreover, as burning becomes more prevalent in eastern Amazonia,
   abandoned sites may not develop into forest and the irreversible
   degradation of the entire regional ecosystem must be contemplated.},

Abstract = {Jubaea chilensis (Molina) Baill., also named Chilean palm, is an endemic
   species found in the coastal area of Mediterranean sclerophyllous forest
   in Chile. It has a highly restricted and fragmented distribution along
   the coast, being under intense exploitation and anthropogenic impact.
   Based on 1038 SNP markers, we evaluated the genetic diversity and
   population structure among six J. chilensis natural groups encompassing
   96\% of the species distribution. We observed low levels of genetic
   diversity, a deficit of heterozygotes (mean H-E = 0.024; H-O = 0.014),
   and high levels of inbreeding (mean F-IS = 0.424). The fixation index
   (F-ST) and Nei's genetic distance pairwise comparisons indicated low to
   moderate structuring among populations. There was no evidence of
   isolation by distance (r = -0.214, p = 0.799). In the cluster analysis,
   we observed a closer relationship among Culimo, Cocalan, and Candelaria
   populations. Migration rates among populations were low, except for some
   populations with moderate values. The K value that best represented the
   spatial distribution of genetic diversity was Delta K = 3. Habitat
   fragmentation, deterioration of the sclerophyllous forest, lack of
   long-distance dispersers, and a natural regeneration deficit may have
   driven inbreeding and low levels of genetic diversity in the palm groves
   of J. chilensis. Although extant populations are not at imminent risk of
   extinction, the rate of inbreeding could increase and migration could
   decrease if the effects of climate change and human impact become more

Abstract = {In eastern Amazon, parameters related to the soil organic matter such as
   litter mass, microbial biomass and organic carbon were measured at sites
   which were reforested after mining. Treatments of the same age were
   compared with the control (primary forest): two 1-year-old reforested
   sites, with and without topsoil replacement before the plantation; two
   11-year-old sites, one with natural regeneration and the other one
   reforested.
   Litter accumulation was lower in both 1-year-old sites than in the
   control. The 11-year-old sites had similar litter mass in the wet and
   dry season but both were greater than the control, confirming that their
   litter production may be higher than that of the climax forest. As
   expected, sites with topsoil replacement showed higher soil organic
   carbon than sites without topsoil. Soil organic carbon in the
   11-year-old sites were similar though lower than in the control,
   suggesting that the recovery of the organic carbon stock needs more than
   a decade. There were no differences in microbial biomass between the
   1-year-old sites with and without topsoil. Differences in soil microbial
   biomass were found neither between the two 11-year-old sites nor between
   each one and the control, indicating that microbial biomass were fully
   recovered within that time.},

Abstract = {Forest fragmentation, a result of deforestation, not only decreases the
   amount of habitat available for wildlife, but also increases the
   isolation of the remaining fragments and the area of edges surrounding
   them. Also, deforestation often leads to the creation of a dynamic
   regenerating matrix where cleared land is subsequently abandoned. Here
   we examine the effects of fragmentation and landscape change on the
   nutritional condition of Amazonian rainforest birds at the Biological
   Dynamics of Forest Fragments Project, near Manaus, Brazil. We analyzed
   ptilochronology-based measurements of feather growth rate in 12 species
   living in fragments within a dynamic landscape over 21 years.
   Ptilochronology serves as an index of nutritional condition by revealing
   energy available for maintenance over 1-2 weeks while the feather is
   grown, allowing intraspecific comparison across treatments. Feather
   growth rate decreased in fragments surrounded by young second-growth
   borders but increased as fragment size and age of adjacent second-growth
   vegetation increased. Results from this simple, yet informative, measure
   of nutritional condition reveal physiological impacts of land cover
   change, including the response of birds to changes occurring at both
   local and landscape levels. Our results highlight the importance of
   looking beyond presence/absence data to describe fragmentation effects,
   and support the value of landscape-scale approaches for the conservation
   of tropical forest biodiversity. (C) 2018 Associacao Brasileira de

Abstract = {We studied the conditions that permit the shrub, Cordia multispicata, to
   establish in Amazon pastures and the potential role of this shrub as a
   `succession facilitator' near the town of Paragominas, Para State,
   Brazil.  Local disturbances that reduce cover such as grazing and
   burning helped C. multispicata establish in pastures in active use. 
   Germination of C. multispicata was significantly improved on sites
   subjected to simulated grazing and seedling growth was hastened
   following pasture burning.  We found that below-ground competition,
   evaluated using root ingrowth cores, was reduced by burning and grazing.
   Recently abandoned pastures are frequently composed of a mix of forbs
   and grasses but as succession proceeds a mosaic of more discrete
   vegetation patches appears.  At our site, a five-year-old abandoned
   pasture, grass patches (primarily Panicum maximum) and shrub patches
   (mainly C. multispicata) were common.  We compared physical and biotic
   characteristics of zones dominated by C. multispicata and P. maximum and
   found:  (1) the rain of bat and bird dispersed seeds of woody species
   was much greater in the zones of C. multispicata (92 seeds/m2/year) than
   in the patches of grass (6 seeds/m2/year); (2) the density of woody
   seedlings was eight times greater in the C. multispicata patches
   (0.65/m2) than in the zones of P. maximum (0.08 woody individuals/m2);
   (3) soil nutrient availability and litter nutrient concentrations were
   greater in the shrub zones than in the grass zones; and (4)
   photosynthetic photon flux density at the soil surface was generally
   more favorable for rainforest tree seedling growth in C. multispicata
   patches (16\% of full sunlight) as compared to the grass zones (7.7\% of
   full sun).  We conclude that the shrub, C. multispicata, acts as a
   magnet, attracting volant seed vectors, and as a nurse plant,
   facilitating the establishment of woody species in abandoned Amazon
   pastures.},

   an endemic palm tree ( Attalea pindobassu Bondar) from the
   Brazilian semi-arid},
Journal = {JOURNAL FOR NATURE CONSERVATION},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {84},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Attalea pindobassu is a palm tree endemic to the northern of the Espinha
   \& ccedil;o chain, found in the Caatinga domain, and it is a key
   non-timber forest product (NTFP) resource for the livelihood and income
   of people in the Brazilian semi-arid. We assessed the influence of
   environmental (soil features) and anthropogenic factors (type of land
   use and harvest intensity) on the natural regeneration and population
   structure of A. pindobassu, identifying the relative importance of these
   factors in the abundance of life stages. We sampled populations in 14
   sites distributed in 63 plots, totaling 9.6 ha. Our sampling ranged from
   well-preserved sites, in natural areas (30 x 0.045 ha plots), to highly
   disturbed pastures in the agroecosystems (33 x 0.25 ha plots), covering
   an extensive area of the species distribution. Differences in the plot
   size occurred due to the conditions of land use, the density of
   individuals, and the spatial distribution in the sampled areas. We
   considered five life stages (seedling, sapling, juvenile, immature
   adult, and reproductive adults), in which seedling and sapling were
   fitted as regenerants. Recruitment failure occurs mostly in sites in
   agricultural and intensive pasture areas, in which habitats with a low
   rate of chronic anthropogenic disturbance showed a higher density of
   regenerants. In these habitats, marked by recruitment bottlenecks,
   populations are likely to become locally extinct. The fruit harvesting
   levels did not affect the density of regenerants. The social and
   economic importance of this species is an ecological asset that can
   foster the development of public policies, further promoting multiple
   sustainable uses of habitat remnants to ensure the application of the
   conservation strategy of under use.},

Abstract = {Fishing in rivers and lakes has traditionally been a longstanding and
   dependable means of sustenance for the people of inland Scandinavia.
   However, our understanding of pre -modern fishing traditions has been
   hampered by a lack of written sources, as well as a scarcity of
   archaeological data. However, a recent excavation and comprehensive
   dendrochronological analysis of a fish trapping enclosure system in Lake
   Nord-Mesna (520 masl.), in the boreal forests of inland Norway, has
   provided unique insight into freshwater fishing traditions, techniques
   and organization. The excavated structure, believed to be a fish weir
   with lath screen traps set into shallow water, was established in the
   late 1200s. In the following years it was regularly maintained in the
   spring/early summer. The last documented repair was in 1343. Its
   abandonment is interpreted as resulting from a recession likely induced
   by factors such as plague and climatic deterioration, that affected
   inland areas of Scandinavia in the 1300s. These results provide
   archaeological evidence of medieval utilization of effective enclosure
   traps in the region. This contradicts the prevailing notion that this
   form of fishing was later introduced by Forest Finns who migrated to the
   area in the 17(th) century. In addition, the findings give new and
   significant information about the organization and practice of medieval
   fishing in inland Scandinavia.},

Journal = {QUATERNARY},
Year = {2023},

Number = {2},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Phytolith analysis is a well-established archaeobotanical tool, having
   provided important insights into pre-Columbian crop cultivation and
   domestication across Amazonia through the Holocene. Yet, its use as a
   palaeoecological tool is in its infancy in Amazonia and its
   effectiveness for reconstructing pre-Columbian land-use beyond
   archaeological sites (i.e., `off-site') has so far received little
   critical attention. This paper examines both new and previously
   published soil phytolith data from SW Amazonia to assess the robustness
   of this proxy for reconstructing pre-Columbian land-use. We conducted
   the study via off-site soil pits radiating 7.5 km beyond a geoglyph in
   Acre state, Brazil, and 50 km beyond a ring-ditch in northern Bolivia,
   spanning the expected gradients in historical land-use intensity. We
   found that the spatio-temporal patterns in palm phytolith data across
   our soil-pit transects support the hypothesis that pre-Columbian peoples
   enriched their forests with palms over several millennia, although
   phytoliths are limited in their ability to capture small-scale crop
   cultivation and deforestation. Despite these drawbacks, we conclude that
   off-site soil phytolith analysis can provide novel insights into
   pre-Columbian land use, provided it is effectively integrated with other
   land-use (e.g., charcoal) and archaeological data.},

Abstract = {A project to restore a degraded area must Firstly reestablish organic

   influence of indigenous tree plantations on changings in soil fertility
   and organic matter dynamics, an experiment was installed at the Poco das

   Six treatments involved mature forests (F), 8-year-old mixed plantations
   of indigenous tree species (P), and abandoned pastures (G), at both the
   flooding (V) and the sloping (M) areas of the Reserve. The experimental
   design was completely randomized. Soil samples were collected at the
   layers 0-2.5cm; 2-5-7.5cm; and 7.5-20cm to evaluate soil pH, and Al,
   Ca+Mg, P, K, C and N contents. The PV treatment showed higher values for
   the exchangeable cations, C and soil organic matter (SOM) contents,
   indicating high cycling rates and biological activity. Sol] stability
   was considered to be high in all treatments, since C:N ratio was lower
   than 12: 1. Organic matter fragmentation showed a higher amount of
   fulvic acids (FA), humic acids (HA) and humin (HU) in the PV treatment,
   for the three soil layers. The plantation on the sloping areas (PM)
   showed the highest values of (FA+HA)/HU ratio, Suggesting a lower
   stability condition.Results suggest indigenous tree plantations have
   great potential to restore nutrient cycling and soil organic matter
   contents in short term period in areas where forests have been converted
   into pastures. Techniques to accelerate the development of trees
   plantation on the sloping areas must be adopted.},

Abstract = {State regulation on restoration techniques is a recent development in
   Brazil, and to the best of our knowledge, it is unprecedented in the
   world. Not surprisingly controversy exists among Brazilian researchers
   and professionals about the appropriateness of such legislation. Here we
   offer a critical analysis of the resolution SMA 08 of the Secretary of
   Environment of the State of Sao Paulo. a law which aims to standardize
   the mixed planting of degraded areas. We believe that the State rules
   are based on assumptions not supported by scientific experimentation,
   since the present understanding of ecological processes involved in the
   restoration of tropical forests is jar from being sufficient for
   standards or norms to be established as yet on this vast subject. In
   addition, the technicians who prepare projects and those who license and
   monitor such projects do not have the knowledge necessary to implement
   the rules of the Resolution. We also argue that strict rules are likely
   to constrain creativity and inhibit initiatives of scientists and
   restoration practitioners, and thus constitute a barrier to innovation
   and creativity It also may well retard expansion of restoration to wider
   areas. From the perspective of biodiversity conservation objectives, we
   also believe that the creation of commercial demand for propagation
   material of rare and threatened species could endanger the conservation
   of natural populations of these species, which should be targeted for
   specific programs. In conclusion, we suggest that the Resolution has not
   helped to accelerate the expansion of restored areas nor does it
   increase the probability of success of restoration initiatives.},

Abstract = {Strong anthropogenic pressure, mainly mineral extraction, is one of the
   main factors leading to degradation of the Brazilian coastal
   environment. Strategies to recover these areas include replanting native
   plant species, and symbiotic fungi from the neighboring area might be
   important for the establishment of the new vegetation. Species richness,
   diversity and community composition of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi
   (AMF) were investigated in NE Brazil in two natural areas, `restinga'
   forest and seaside `restinga', and in two areas of revegetated dunes
   after mining activity 20 and 8 years ago. Soil samples were collected
   during the dry (March) and wet (September) seasons of 2009 in Mataraca,
   Paraiba State, Brazil. Based on glomerospore morphology, 34 species of
   AMF were recorded, of which 29 were identified in field samples and five
   after trap culturing, with the greatest diversity and richness found in
   the dune revegetated 8 years ago. The sampling effort allowed an
   assessment of between 70 and 80 \% of the species estimated for the
   areas by the first-order Jackknife index. Among the generalist species
   Gigaspora margarita was the only one found in all areas and during both
   collection periods. The similarity of AMF species between the
   revegetated areas and the seaside `restinga' was > 60 \%, supporting the
   hypothesis that this area represents a source of propagules, but the
   substrate used for seedling production may also bring other species,
   enabling the recovery of the AMF community in the mined and revegetated
   dunes.},

Abstract = {We document the expansion of the breeding distribution of the Little
   Blue Heron Egretta caerulea (Linnaeus, 1758) to 850 km beyond its
   previous southern limit in South America. In addition we present data on
   abundance, breeding biology and food of the species in the Patos Lagoon
   estuary, the area which the species recently colonized. The maximum
   abundance recorded in the breeding colony and in a nocturnal roosting
   site was 53 and 49 individuals respectively. Nesting occurred from
   September to March. Birds nested in a mixed breeding colony together
   with about 3,000 breeding pairs of seven other species of
   Pelecaniformes, in a swampy forest near the margin of the estuary. Five
   nests were between 1.5 and 4.3 m from the ground, on the shrub
   Daphnopsis racemosa (Thymelaeaceae), on the trees Sebastiana
   brasiliensis (Euphorbiaceae) and Mimosa bimucronata (Leguminosae), or on
   the bamboo Bambusa sp. (Poaceae). Four nests produced two fledglings
   each, while one nest was abandoned. Of 13 grouped samples of food
   regurgitated by five nestlings, Pink Shrimp Farfantepenaeus paulensis
   (Perez-Farfante, 1967) constituted 70\% in mass, while total length of
   ingested fishes and shrimps varied mostly between 20 and 50 mm.
   Estuarine prey items represented 99\% of the total food mass. The recent
   southward expansion of the breeding range of the Little Blue Heron in
   South America may be a response to climate warming of the Patos Lagoon
   estuary. Degradation of estuaries in the southwestern Atlantic may also
   be forcing the birds to breed in areas outside previous geographical
   range.},

Month = {APR 11},
Abstract = {Although the impacts of climate change on biodiversity are increasing
   worldwide, few studies have attempted to forecast these impacts on
   Amazon Tropical Forest. In this study, we estimated the impact of
   climate change on Amazonian avian assemblages considering range shifts,
   species loss, vulnerability of ecosystem functioning, future
   effectiveness of current protected areas and potential climatically
   stable areas for conservation actions. Species distribution modelling
   based on two algorithms and three different scenarios of climate change
   was used to forecast 501 avian species, organized on main ecosystem
   functions (frugivores, insectivores and nectarivores) for years 2050 and
   2070. Considering the entire study area, we estimated that between 4 and
   19\% of the species will find no suitable habitat. Inside the currently
   established protected areas, species loss could be over 70\%. Our
   results suggest that frugivores are the most sensitive guild, which
   could bring consequences on seed dispersal functions and on natural
   regeneration. Moreover, we identified the western and northern parts of
   the study area as climatically stable. Climate change will potentially
   affect avian assemblages in southeastern Amazonia with detrimental
   consequences to their ecosystem functions. Information provided here is
   essential to conservation practitioners and decision makers to help on
   planning their actions.},

Abstract = {The tropical vegetation growing in dystrophic soils is capable of
   recycling nutrients through litterfall and thus maintaining soil
   fertility. However, climate changes can alter this production and,
   consequently, the litter layer over the soil, affecting the carbon cycle
   and the integrity of the ecosystem. In this study, we investigated
   whether a reduction in rainfall increased the litterfall and the litter
   layer (stock) and, if so, whether the effects are more evident in
   degraded environments. We compared the litterfall and the litter layer
   in years with higher (1575.3 mm) and lower (1360.8 mm) rainfall rates in
   three environments: ``cerradao{''} (CD; savanna woodland), typical
   ``cerrado{''} (savanna-like vegetation) and successional area (SA). We
   recorded increasing litterfall in the SA and in the litter layer in the
   three environments during the year with lower rainfall rates. We also
   detected alterations to the seasonal variation in the litter layer and
   the production of reproductive parts. The reduction in rainfall
   increased the return of carbon to the soil, especially in open areas.
   Our results indicate that climatic extremes (e.g., reduced rainfall) can
   modify the availability of nutrients and their absorption by plants and
   therefore compromising important ecosystem functions, such as carbon
   cycle.},

Abstract = {Amazonian Dark Earths (ADE) or Terra Preta de Aindio formed in the past
   by pre-Columbian populations are highly sustained fertile soils
   supported by microbial communities that differ from those extant in
   adjacent soils. These soils are found in the Amazon region and are
   considered as a model soil when compared to the surrounding and
   background soils. The aim of this study was to assess the effects of ADE
   and its surrounding soil on the rhizosphere bacterial communities of two
   leguminous plant species that frequently occur in the Amazon region in
   forest sites (Mimosa debilis) and open areas (Senna alata). Bacterial
   community structure was evaluated using terminal restriction fragment
   length polymorphism (T-RFLP) and bacterial community composition by V4
   16S rRNA gene region pyrosequencing. T-RFLP analysis showed effect of
   soil types and plant species on rhizosphere bacterial community
   structure. Differential abundance of bacterial phyla, such as
   Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria, Verrucomicrobia, and Firmicutes, revealed
   that soil type contributes to shape the bacterial communities.
   Furthermore, bacterial phyla such as Firmicutes and Nitrospira were
   mostly influenced by plant species. Plant roots influenced several soil
   chemical properties, especially when plants were grown in ADE. These
   results showed that differences observed in rhizosphere bacterial
   community structure and composition can be influenced by plant species
   and soil fertility due to variation in soil attributes.},

Abstract = {Agricultural intensification practices have been adopted in the
   Brazilian savanna (Cerrado), mainly in the transition between Cerrado
   and the Amazon Forest, to increase productivity while reducing pressure
   for new land clearing. Due to the growing demand for more sustainable
   practices, more accurate information on geospatial monitoring is
   required. Remote sensing products and artificial intelligence models for
   pixel-by-pixel classification have great potential. Therefore, we
   developed a methodological framework with spectral indices (Normalized
   Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalized Difference Water Index
   (NDWI), and Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI)) derived from the
   Harmonized Landsat Sentinel-2 (HLS) and machine learning algorithms
   (Random Forest (RF), Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), and Extreme
   Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)) to map agricultural intensification
   considering three hierarchical levels, i.e., temporary crops (level 1),
   the number of crop cycles (level 2), and the crop types from the second
   season in double-crop systems (level 3) in the 2021-2022 crop growing
   season in the municipality of Sorriso, Mato Grosso State, Brazil. All
   models were statistically similar, with an overall accuracy between 85
   and 99\%. The NDVI was the most suitable index for discriminating
   cultures at all hierarchical levels. The RF-NDVI combination mapped best
   at level 1, while at levels 2 and 3, the best model was XGBoost-NDVI.
   Our results indicate the great potential of combining HLS data and
   machine learning to provide accurate geospatial information for
   decision-makers in monitoring agricultural intensification, with an aim

Journal = {JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {79},
Number = {6},
Pages = {1315-1323},

Abstract = {P>1. For animal species inhabiting heterogeneous landscapes, the
   tortuosity of the dispersal path is a key determinant of the success in
   locating habitat patches. Path tortuosity within and beyond perceptual
   range must differ, and may be differently affected by intrinsic
   attributes of individuals and extrinsic environmental factors.
   Understanding how these factors interact to determine path tortuosity
   allows more accurate inference of successful movements between habitat
   patches.
   2. We experimentally determined the effects of intrinsic (body mass and
   species identity) and extrinsic factors (distance to nearest forest
   fragment and matrix type) on the tortuosity of movements of three
   forest-dwelling didelphid marsupials, in a fragmented landscape of the
   Atlantic Forest, Brazil.
   3. A total of 202 individuals were captured in forest fragments and
   released in three unsuitable matrix types (mowed pasture, abandoned
   pasture and manioc plantation), carrying spool-and-line devices.
   4. Twenty-four models were formulated representing a priori hypotheses
   of major determinants of path tortuosity, grouped in three scenarios
   (only intrinsic factors, only extrinsic factors and models with
   combinations of both), and compared using a model selection approach.
   Models were tested separately for individuals released within the
   perceptual range of the species, and for individuals released beyond the
   perceptual range.
   5. Matrix type strongly affected path tortuosity, with more obstructed
   matrix types hampering displacement of animals. Body mass was more
   important than species identity to determine path tortuosity, with
   larger animals moving more linearly. Increased distance to the fragment
   resulted in more tortuous paths, but actually reflects a threshold in
   perceptual range: linear paths within perceptual range, tortuous paths
   beyond.
   6. The variables tested explained successfully path tortuosity, but only
   for animals released within the perceptual range. Other factors, such as
   wind intensity and direction of plantation rows, may be more important
   for individuals beyond their perceptual range.
   7. Simplistic scenarios considering only intrinsic or extrinsic factors
   are inadequate to predict path tortuosity, and to infer dispersal
   success in heterogeneous landscapes. Perceptual range represents a
   fundamental threshold where the effects of matrix type, body mass and
   individual behaviour change drastically.},

Abstract = {DINAMICA, a spatially explicit simulation model of landscape dynamics
   has been developed. DINAMICA is a cellular automata model that presents
   multi-scale vicinity-based transitional functions, incorporation of
   spatial feedback approach to a stochastic multi-step simulation engine,
   arid the application of logistic regression to calculate the spatial
   dynamic transition probabilities. This model was initially conceived for
   the simulation of Amazonian landscape dynamics, particularly the
   landscapes evolved in areas occupied by small farms. For testing its
   performance, the model was used to simulate spatial patterns of land-use
   and land-cover changes produced by the Amazonian colonists in clearing
   the forest, cultivating the land, and eventually abandoning it for
   vegetation succession. The study area is located in an Amazonian
   colonization frontier in the north of Mato Grosso state, Brazil. The
   model was run for two sub-areas of colonization projects, using an
   8-year time span, from 1986 to 1994. The simulated maps were compared
   with land-use and land-cover maps, obtained from digital classification
   of remote sensing images, using the multiple resolution fitting
   procedure and a set of landscape structure measures, including fractal
   dimension, contagion index, and the number of patches for each type of
   land-use and land-cover class. The results from the validation methods
   for the two areas showed a good performance of the model indicating that
   it can be used for replicating the spatial patterns created by landscape
   dynamics in Amazonian colonization regions occupied by small farms.
   Possible applications of DINAMICA include the evaluation of landscape
   fragmentation produced by different architectures of colonization
   projects and the prediction of a region's spatial pattern evolution
   according to various dynamic phases. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All

Title = {Cost-Benefit Analysis of Landscape Restoration: A Stocktake},
Journal = {LAND},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {9},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {With the increase in demand for landscape restoration and the limited
   resources available, there is need for economic analysis of landscape
   restoration to help prioritize investment of the resources. Cost-benefit
   analysis (CBA) is a commonly applied tool in the economic analysis of
   landscape restoration, yet its application seems limited and varied. We
   undertake a review of CBA applications to understand the breadth, depth,
   and gaps. Of the 2056 studies identified in literature search, only 31
   met our predefined criteria. Three studies offered a global perspective,
   while more than half were conducted in Africa. Only six countries
   benefit from at least 2 CBA studies, including Brazil, Ethiopia, Kenya,
   Vietnam, South Africa, and Tanzania. About 60\% focus on agroforestry,
   afforestation, reforestation, and assisted natural regeneration
   practices. Only 16\% covered all cost categories, with opportunity costs
   being the least covered. Eighty-four percent apply direct use values,
   while only 16\% captured the non-use values. Similarly, lack of reliable
   data due to predictions and assumptions involved in data generation
   influenced CBA results. The limited number of eligible studies and the
   weaknesses identified hereinabove suggest strong need for improvements
   in both the quantity and quality of CBA to better inform planning,
   policies, and investments in landscape restoration.},

Abstract = {This paper presents innovative methods for using satellite image time
   series to produce land use and land cover classification over large
   areas in Brazil from 2001 to 2016. We used Moderate Resolution Imaging
   Spectroradiometer (MODIS) time series data to classify natural and
   human-transformed land areas in the state of Mato Grosso, Brazil's
   agricultural frontier. Our hypothesis is that building high-dimensional
   spaces using all values of the time series, coupled with advanced
   statistical learning methods, is a robust and efficient approach for
   land cover classification of large data sets. We used the full depth of
   satellite image time series to create large dimensional spaces for
   statistical classification. The data consist of MODIS MOD13Q1 time
   series with 23 samples per year per pixel, and 4 bands (Normalized
   Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI),
   near-infrared (nir) and mid-infrared (mir)). By taking a series of
   labelled time series, we fed a 92 dimensional attribute space into a
   support vector machine model. Using a 5-fold cross validation, we
   obtained an overall accuracy of 94\% for discriminating among nine land
   cover classes: forest, cerrado, pasture, soybean fallow, fallow-cotton,
   soybean-cotton, soybean-corn, soybean-millet, and soybean-sunflower.
   Producer and user accuracies for all classes were close to or better
   than 90\%. The results highlight important trends in agricultural
   intensification in Mato Grosso. Double crop systems are now the most
   common production system in the state, sparing land from agricultural
   production. Pasture expansion and intensification has been less studied
   than crop expansion, although it has a stronger impact on deforestation
   and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Our results point to a significant
   increase in the stocking rate in Mato Grosso and to the possible
   abandonment of pasture areas opened in the state's frontier. The
   detailed land cover maps contribute to an assessment of the interplay
   between production and protection in the Brazilian Amazon and Cerrado
   biomes.},

Title = {On the natural history of the South American pepper frog,
   Leptodactylus labyrinthicus (Spix, 1824) (Anura: Leptodactylidae)},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF NATURAL HISTORY},
Year = {2005},
Volume = {39},
Number = {7},
Pages = {555-566},
Abstract = {Some species of Leptodactylus of the L. pentadactylus group lay their
   eggs outside water but the tadpoles need to reach water to complete the
   larval phase; other species complete development in terrestrial nests.
   Here we present details of the reproduction of L. labyrinthicus in
   south-eastern Brazil. ne proportion of tadpoles and trophic eggs in aged
   egg clutches was determined, as well as the growth of the tadpoles while
   in the nest. The gut contents of tadpoles that were in egg clutches of
   frogs were analysed. Adult males did not differ from females in size and
   had hypertrophied forearms and an enlarged spine on the thumb.
   Reproduction was initiated with the first rains of August/September and
   extended to mid-January. Calling and spawning occurred at permanent or
   temporary water bodies. The foam nests were built in excavated basins
   outside of, but close to the water. The male determined the place of the
   basin construction; after amplexus, the female completed the excavation.
   The amplexus was axillary. One female spent the day after spawning in
   the foam. The eggs were pale grey, the yolk averaging 2.3 mm, in
   diameter. The mean number of eggs was 2101 per egg clutch. The number of
   tadpoles in individual nests varied between 0.05\% and 11.40\% in
   relation to the total laid eggs. The tadpoles entered water when rains
   flooded the basin. The tadpoles grew to 12 times the weight of an
   individual egg while in the nest; no nesting tadpole was beyond stage
   25. The longest time we followed tadpoles in a nest was 25 days.
   Tadpoles were found preying upon eggs of three other frog species and
   upon conspecific eggs. Males fought by grasping each other in a
   belly-to-belly position; the powerful arms and the thumb spines
   represent weapons. Even though males can reach maturity in the season
   following birth, small size would prevent them from establishing their
   own territory. All the species of the L. pentadactylus group may build
   their foam nests within excavated basins. The basins may protect the
   eggs and embryos from cannibalistic tadpoles and may have an
   anti-desiccation effect. In order to produce trophic eggs, the female
   may delay laying additional unfertilized eggs until after the male has
   abandoned the foam nest. Anuran eggs represent an important food item
   for tadpoles after they leave the nest.},

Abstract = {The mining and metallurgical industry sector activities often release
   potential toxic elements (PTE) surrounding exploitation area. We
   evaluated the addition of phosphate and lime using the dosage of 0.5:1,
   1:1, and 2:1 molar ratio of PO43- and CO32- to the sum of PTE,
   respectively, and also, biochar and biosolids using the dosage of 2.5,
   5, and 10\% (m:m) to immobilize PTE in contaminated forest soil (Pb (270
   mg kg-1) and Zn (858 mg kg-1)) near an abandoned mine site in Brazil.
   The desorption by stirred flow kinetics revealed that 15\% of the total
   Zn and 12\% Pb contents are mobile before any amendment application.
   Phosphate amendment decreased Pb desorption but increased Zn desorption.
   Biochar and biosolids immobilize high amounts of Zn and Pb because of
   their high cation exchange capacities and alkaline properties; however,
   20\% biosolid dose increased Pb desorption. X-ray absorption
   spectroscopy suggested Zn-kerolite as the major species in the
   contaminated soil, likely from mine dust. The change in Zn speciation
   after soil amendment addition indicated that biochar and lime kept a
   high proportion of Zn-Al species, whereas phosphate and biosolids led to
   more Zn-Fe species. Our results pointed out that lime might reduce both
   Pb and Zn mobilities; however, field trials are crucial to confirm the
   immobilization efficiency of lime and other amendments over long term.},

Abstract = {The intensification of the anthropization process, associate with the
   characteristics of the Cerrado soils, which are largely oligotrophic and
   weathered, are an impediment to natural regeneration of forest species,
   requiring human intervention to restore the natural landscape. The
   present study had as objectives to indicate species to initiate the
   process of recovery of degraded areas of the Cerrado with presence of
   plintite and established erosion process. In this way, we analyze the
   rates of increase in diameter and height; and the survival and mortality
   rate of 963 individuals planted near the ciliary area, at different
   spacings and with different species composition model. Increment and
   survival values varied greatly from species to species. Of the 17 trees
   species planted eight presented survival rates equal to or greater than
   80\%. The rates of increase in height and diameter were classified into
   three groups: low, medium and high increment. Regarding the height,
   about 50\% of the species tested showed high to medium increment. Eight
   species had values of increments considered low and two species were not
   measured due to the high mortality. For the distribution of the
   diametric increments, except for I. laurina all species showed low
   increment value. In general, the low values of increments observed in
   this experiment are explained, greatly, by the abiotic factors, mainly
   the edaphic characteristics of the area. The absence of horizon A and
   the petroplinthic character reduces the total volume of soil available
   to be explored by the roots, put at risk the plants growth rates.
   However, even under unfavorable environmental conditions, the studied
   species showed a rusticity. Among the arboreal species studied, T.
   urumeuva, A. aculeata, A. niopoides, G. ulmifolia, E. nitens, G.
   americana and I. laurina presented a high to medium survival rate with
   high increases. These characteristics indicate that the species
   mentioned are apt to initiate the recovery process.},

Month = {APR 25},
Abstract = {The ``Critically Endangered{''} Alagoas Antwren Myrmotherula snowi is
   found only in the Atlantic Rainforest of north-east Brazil. We surveyed
   all sites where the species has been recorded, as well as 15 other
   potential sites. We summarise all observations of the species, focusing
   on the period from 2016 onwards, and including systematic censuses in
   three breeding seasons (October-March 2018/19, 2019/20, and 2020/21) at
   the type locality, Murici, where we also searched for nests of the
   species. We did not locate any individuals at sites other than Murici.
   The number of apparent individuals detected declined by 67\% over seven
   years (a decline of 50\% over the three years in which standardised
   systematic counts were made), and only six adults were observed in the
   most recent breeding season. The global population is now likely to be
   in single-digit figures. Of five nests found, four failed, through
   predation by snakes and opossums, and abandonment. We installed
   protective barriers to protect two of these nests from predators, which
   may have contributed to the single successful fledging. Such methods
   offer most hope for now of stalling the decline. Efforts to develop
   captive breeding methods with model species have been underway since
   2019 but face many difficulties. Improving habitat protection and
   restoration is crucial but will only take effect in the long term.},

Abstract = {Agroforestry systems are an alternative option for sustainable
   production management. These systems contain trees that absorb nutrients
   from deeper layers of the soil and leaf litter that help improve the
   soil quality of the rough terrain in high altitude areas, which are
   areas extremely susceptible to environmental degradation. The aim of
   this study was to characterize the stock and nutrients in litter, soil
   activity and the population of microorganisms in coffee (Coffea arabica
   L.) plantations under high altitude agroforestry systems in the
   semi-arid region of the state of Pernambuco, Brazil. Samples were
   collected from the surface litter together with soil samples taken at
   two depths (0-10 and 10-20 cm) from areas each subject to one of the
   following four treatments: agroforestry system (AS), native forest (NF),
   biodynamic system (BS) and coffee control (CT). The coffee plantation
   had been abandoned for nearly 15 years and, although there had been no
   management or harvesting, still contained productive coffee plants. The
   accumulation of litter and mean nutrient content of the litter, the soil
   nutrient content, microbial biomass carbon, total carbon, total
   nitrogen, C/N ratio, basal respiration, microbial quotient, metabolic
   quotient and microbial populations (total bacteria, fluorescent bacteria
   group, total fungi and Trichoderma spp.) were all analyzed. The systems
   that were exposed to human intervention (AS and BS) differed in their
   chemical attributes and contained higher levels of nutrients when
   compared to NF and CT. BS for coffee production at high altitude can be
   used as a sustainable alternative in the high altitude zones of the
   semi-arid region in Brazil, which is an area that is highly susceptible
   to environmental degradation.},

Abstract = {The cattle sector in Brazil (and in other countries of South America) is
   substantial in terms of size and potential impacts in world markers. Due
   to the sheer magnitude and potential of the Brazilian cattle sector, it

   rules for trade in livestock products and more effective control of hoof
   and mouth disease in some ar eas of Brazil could cause it to become a
   more formidable beef importer. Brazil also warrants attention because of
   the controversial practice of deforestation for cattle production in the
   Amazon rain forest. A vocal environmental lobby has decried cattle
   production in the Amazon, but this practice continues. This paper
   reviews the status, prospects and controversies of the beef sector in

Abstract = {Over the past forty years, Itacolomi State Park (ISP), located in the
   region of Ouro Preto/Minas Gerais, has been subject to several changes
   in its patterns of land use and occupation. These changes were recorded
   and quantified using remote sensing and GIS techniques, which allowed
   for the construction of four land use maps, representing the changes in
   the area during the last four decades. In order to evaluate these
   changes, the following classes of vegetation were defined: Seasonal
   Semideciduous Forest, Rocky outcrops and Anthropogenic Areas. First,
   land use maps from 1966 and 1974 were compared, defining the first
   period of analysis; then, 1974 and 1986 maps were considered in the
   second period of analysis, and finally the third period of analysis used
   1986 and 2000 maps. The changes that occurred in ISP were predominantly
   of anthropogenic origin, with greater intensity in the seventies. As a
   result of the abandonment of these activities and also due to greater
   monitoring and control of human actions performed at ISP during the
   following decades, the abandoned areas are gradually being occupied by
   native plants such as ``candeia{''} (Eremanthus sp), rehabilitating the
   region.},

Title = {Facilitation and allelopathy mediate phylogenetic and functional
   diversity under Atlantic Rainforest trees},
Journal = {FLORA},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {317},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Plant phylogeny, diversity, and production of germination inhibiting
   chemicals can be used as patterns for inferring key drivers of plant
   community construction and assembly. We conducted the study in a
   restoration area of Atlantic Rainforest from Southeast Brazil. In this
   context, we aimed to investigate community assembly rules by
   simultaneously evaluating the relationships of species with a
   phylogenetic, functional, and ecophysiological (allelopathy) approach
   and multifaceted beta diversity (taxonomic, phylogenetic, and
   functional). We measured the plant canopy height and diameter at soil
   height for all individuals and determined successional group and
   dispersal syndrome for all species regenerating in open areas and below
   18 adult individuals of each tree species Bixa atlantica Antar \& Sano,
   Inga laurina (Sw.) Willd., Joannesia princeps Vell. and Senna multijuga
   subsp. multijuga var. verrucosa (Vogel) H.S.Irwin \& Barneby.
   Phylogenetic and functional indexes of community structure were
   calculated with the net relatedness index and the nearest taxon index.
   Taxonomic, phylogenetic, and functional diversities (respectively, TD,
   PD, and FD) for the regenerating community in each area were calculated
   and pairwise comparisons were made for TD, FD, and PD components of beta
   diversity. Tests of tree species allelopathy derived from leaf extract
   were performed with seeds of Lactuca sativa L. (Asteraceae). The effects
   of diversity and extracts on seed germination were analyzed using
   generalized linear models. The phylogenetic and functional structure of
   the regenerating communities under the four tree species did not differ
   from random for the four studied tree species. The PD was significantly
   higher for the communities that regenerated under Joannesia, while the
   FD was higher under both Joannesia and Senna, compared to communities
   from open sites, evidencing a facilitation mechanism for these two
   species. Only Senna and Inga differed from random in relation to beta TD
   and beta FD, suggesting possible environmental changes in these areas.
   Seeds irrigated with the extracts of Inga, Joannesia, and Senna
   inhibited germination in an intermediate way, whereas seeds irrigated
   with Bixa extract had only 1 \% germination, indicating allelopathic
   effects. In this way, the planted species directly influence the
   organization of communities that regenerate below their canopies. It is
   therefore important to choose species that can contribute to improving
   diversity, and thus favor the success of restoration projects.},

Title = {Effects of topsoil transposition on the taxonomic and functional

Journal = {AUSTRAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {47},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Topsoil transposition has been identified as an environmental
   restoration technique capable of accelerating regeneration in degraded
   areas. In addition to the seed bank, topsoil contains invertebrates and
   microorganisms essential in ecological succession. This study evaluated
   the temporal variation in the macrofauna community structure in an
   experiment with topsoil transposition. We hypothesized that the
   morphospecies richness, functional groups and macrofauna biomass would
   be higher in the plots with topsoil and native vegetation compared with
   plots with no topsoil. We further hypothesized that the composition of
   macrofauna community and the proportion of functional groups in the
   topsoil and the reference plots would become more similar over time. The
   community was compared between plots that received topsoil, plots that
   did not receive topsoil and plots in a natural vegetation, over 14
   months. The macrofauna biomass and the diversity of functional groups
   were equivalent in the degraded area and the topsoil. The effect of
   treatment on richness depended on time, and it was possible to observe
   higher values of macrofauna richness in the topsoil compared with the
   degraded area in some months. The compositions of the macrofauna
   communities in the degraded area and the topsoil showed greater
   similarity to each other. In contrast, the reference area showed the
   greatest dissimilarity with the other treatments. In general, the
   macrofauna community in the topsoil remained more similar to the
   degraded area. However, in the topsoil plots, we found higher macrofauna
   richness during rainy months and an increase in predator biomass. In
   conclusion, the macrofauna community in the topsoil, which has changed
   over time, presented higher values of morphospecies richness in some
   months and the increase in predator biomass, indicating an increase in
   the complexity of the community. Besides, the topsoil can improve
   biodiversity, but this does not produce the natural communities found at
   reference sites, in a small-time scale experiment.},

Abstract = {While land use change in Brazil is characterized by strong cropland
   expansion, the federal state of Rio de Janeiro, located in Southeast
   Brazil, shows an opposite trend: a significant amount of cropland has
   been abandoned. The temporal and spatial distribution of farmland
   abandonment in Rio de Janeiro state was analyzed at the municipal level
   from 1991 to 2013. Developments differ strongly between the different
   regions. The Norte Fluminense Region, which holds the highest share of
   cropping area in the state, showed the highest cropland abandonment.
   This decrease was mainly due to a reduction of the areas used for the
   cultivation of banana, maize, and sugarcane. In the Baixadas and
   Metropolitan regions, the reduction of areas for orange plantations
   played an important role, while the reduction of areas for coffee
   production was important for mountainous areas. Another transition seems
   to be the substitution of sugarcane cultivation with pineapple
   cultivation. Areas for coconut crop production increased mainly in the
   Quissama municipality. Areas for manioc crop production remained stable
   throughout the analysis. The patterns identified in this paper will
   provide an important background for the policy-makers in implementing
   spatially explicit plans for the agricultural sector.},

Abstract = {Phyllomedusa tarsius is an arboreal frog species that suspends its eggs

   necessary for embryo development. I compared the hatching Success of P.
   tarsius in ponds located in pasture, Vismia spp. regrowth, Cecropia spp.
   regrowth, forest fragments and continuous forest at a site in central
   Amazonia. Reproductive success of P. tarsius is measured as percentage
   of clutches producing at least one tadpole and number of tadpoles
   produced per clutch. Reproductive success was higher in Cecropia
   regrowth, forest fragments and continuous forest, compared to pasture
   and Vismia regrowth. Desiccation and flooding were the main causes of
   clutch loss in pasture and Vismia regrowth, while predation was more
   frequent in forest and Cecropia regrowth. The levels of successful of P.
   tarsius clutches observed across all habitat types suggests that a
   landscape mosaic including pasture, secondary growth and forest
   fragments may allow for recolonization and genetic exchange to occur in

Abstract = {Headwater Control is about integrated land management. Effective
   headwater management requires better information, better technologies,
   better management structures, change in land husbandry and direct
   engineering interventions. Headwater regions often waste their
   resources. In Jammu and Kashmir, 40\% (and in South Africa and Iranian
   Azerbaijan 60\%) of the water resource runs to waste. Azerbaijan's
   planners believe that 25\% could be collected for agriculture. In
   Xinjiang, China, by contrast, over-utilisation of the headwater
   resources in the Tarim Basin has caused desertification and large-scale
   farmland abandonment downstream Better systems of water resource
   accounting are required. Eventually, the Lesotho Highlands Water Project
   may generate 25\% of that nation's foreign exchange earnings.
   Acidification is linked to the human impact in headwaters. Previously,
   pH was controlled by climatic, lithologic, edaphic and biologic factors.
   New Japanese work stresses the role of the weathered layer beneath the
   soils of tropical steeplands in moderating the hydrologic impacts of
   forestation and acid precipitation Elsewhere, pollution plays a critical
   role, especially the deposition of air pollutants. Time trends of NO3-
   and SO42- deposition may be dwarfed by natural geographical variations
   within a smalt basin. However, the chief agencies are decreasingly
   SO42-, increasingly NO3- and more generally agricultural chemicals and
   other human wastes. Riverine microbial biofilms act as both sinks and
   sources for pollutants. In Canada, effective prevention of
   non-point-source pollution required a compromise between the net welfare
   of farmers, the wider non-farm community and the environment. Better
   systems of water quality management are required. The riparian zone is
   often counted critical. Fragmentation of both the riparian zone and its
   management rank among the most serious challenges for land managers.
   However, while restoring riparian vegetation reduces sediment loads and
   increases the biodiversity of affected rivers, it may not mitigate
   acidification. Mathematical models for predicting runoff from alpine
   catchments are evaluated. USDAHL with GIS, HEC-1 and RUNOFF-5 are
   generally satisfactory and HYRROM is useful for engineering.
   Empirical studies show that forests moderate hydrological and erosional
   processes. In Serbia, 15-years study in steep headwater basins finds
   that forest covers > 70\%, rather than < 49\%, yield smaller flood peaks
   and provide a more sustained flow (dry for 13.4 days/year-1 vs. 121.4 or
   more). In Japan's mountain headwaters, reforestation reduces water
   losses. Here, increased evapotranspiration is compensated by decreased
   deep seepage. In Alaska, tree roots prove as important as pore water
   pressure in regulating landsliding on steep dopes with shallow soils.
   Soil erosion remains a major problem. In Brazil, regional estimates of
   soil loss were a seventh of those due to rill and gully erosion in
   fields under conventional tillage. In Lithuania, soil depth declines
   ranging from 0.12 - 0.94 m and soil fertility declines ranging from 22\%
   to 63\% are reported. In the Himalaya soil nutrient deficiencies are
   widespread and agricultural inputs are inadequate to the maintenance of
   fertility levels. Overgrazing, forest conversion, the harvesting of wild
   medicinal herbs, road construction and mining cause soil degradation and
   permit ecological invasion by alien weed species. The situation of the
   headwater farmer, struggling with land degradation, contrasts with that
   of the padi farmer downstream, whose fields are enriched with soils and
   nutrients lost from the uplands. Elsewhere, sediment and agrochemical
   pollution causes problems downstream In Canada, conservation tillage
   proves best pollution control practice for both the farmers and non-farm
   community. In Brazil, rill and gully erosion was eliminated by the
   adoption of no-till agriculture. In Lithuania, returning steeper slopes
   to pasture reduced soil losses to zero. Cover management reduced soil
   losses in Algeria Small grain cultivation reduced soil losses to a half
   or a third of bare fallow. In Japan, stone mulches prove effective
   against erosion. In Yunnan, China, contour cultivation with straw
   mulching is more effective against erosion than contour cultivation and,
   in descending order, inter-cropping, no-till, polythene mulching or
   conventional agriculture. Soil losses are widely linked to individual
   aggressive rainfall events. In Nepal the two most severe storms each
   year commonly account for >80\% of total soil loss. In the Himalaya and
   Sierra Nevada, overgrazing, and in Brazil, India, and China,
   agricultural extension, are other major causes. In Serbia, headwater
   depopulation reduced soil losses, Headwater Control requires improved
   land husbandry. The empowerment of local communities is the best route.
   UNCED's Chapter 13 echoes the MC belief in working with local
   communities to match economic land use with land capability. New
   participatory institutional frameworks, based on public trust doctrines
   and `basin citizenship', are introduced.},

Abstract = {Despite recent advances in revealing the evolutionary history of
   speciose tropical plant clades, many species radiations are still poorly
   understood phylogenetically. One of these is the species-rich
   neotropical genus Tachigali (similar to 90 spp.), a caesalpinioid legume
   lineage of mostly ant-housing canopy trees that has diversified in the
   tropical rainforest biome across the Andean foothills, Amazon basin, and
   Atlantic Coastal Forest of Brazil. It is also ecologically dominant
   across the fire-prone savanna vegetation of the Brazilian Cerrado. The
   taxonomic history of Tachigali has long been confounded with the genus
   Sclerolobium, with the two differing in floral symmetry. Here, we
   reconstruct the phylogeny of Tachigali using densely sampled Bayesian
   and maximum likelihood analyses of nuclear ribosomal (ITS/5.8S) and
   plastid (matK and trnL intron) DNA sequences for 67 species. All
   phylogenetic analyses support Tachigali as monophyletic. We recognize a
   broad circumscription of Tachigali encompassing species exhibiting both
   radially and bilaterally symmetrical flowers, and we suggest that the
   traditional generic concept of Sclerolobium should be abandoned. The
   poor resolution in the Tachigali phylogeny is suggestive of rapid
   diversification, which has been observed in other species-rich
   rainforest-inhabiting plant clades across the Neotropics.},

Abstract = {One of the ways to evaluate the success of restoration strategies in
   degraded areas, in terms of restoring pollination, key process for the
   reproduction of most angiosperm species, is evaluating species traits,
   how they respond to changes in the environment and influence their
   interacting partners. In this study we asked: (i) does the phenological
   variation, the restoration strategy and the restoration age influence
   species richness, abundance, species composition and distribution of
   traits of bees and plants? (ii) do functionally similar species tend to
   interact with the same mutualistic partners? (iii) what are the most
   important traits that explain the similarity of interacting partners? We
   analyzed bee and plant communities in restored areas in the Atlantic
   Forest. We found that bee richness and abundance did not vary, and plant
   richness varied temporally. Bee and plant composition changed over time
   and among restoration strategies. Plant composition also varied with the
   restoration age. Functional composition, especially of bees, varied
   little among the tested factors. We also found that species with similar
   traits tended to interact with similar partners, and bee size, proboscis
   length and nesting sites were the most important traits to explain the
   interactions, while for plants, the most important traits were form of
   life, corolla color and shape. Our study demonstrated that interactions
   between bees and plants can be mediated by plant phenology and,
   considering that plant traits filter pollinators' traits, the choice of
   plant traits in restoration areas is fundamental for interactions.},

Abstract = {Although biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) is considered the main input
   of N in mature and regenerating native tropical vegetation, it has
   seldom been quantified. Biomass and N accumulation and fixation were
   determined for spontaneously occurring herbaceous species in caatinga
   areas in four regeneration stages (2, 17, 39 and > 50 years after
   abandonment from agricultural use). BNF was estimated using the N-15
   natural-abundance method. The 2-year regeneration area had the highest
   total herb (6,355 kg ha(-1)) and legume (262 kg ha(-1)) biomass
   production, N stocks (82 kg ha(-1)) and fixed N (5.0 kg ha(-1)).
   N-2-fixing legumes (nine species in the sampled area) contributed over
   97 \% of legume biomass in all areas. Macroptilium gracile added the
   largest amount of N (3.9 kg ha(-1) in the 2-year regeneration area)
   because of its large biomass production (205 kg ha(-1)), although it was
   not the species with the highest proportion of fixed N (76 \%). All of
   the N-2-fixing species obtained large proportions of their N from
   symbiosis, most of them more than 50 \%.However, the amounts of fixed N
   per unit area were relatively low (0.22-5.00 kg ha(-1)) because the
   biomass of N-2-fixing species was always less than 5 \% of the total
   herb biomass.},

Title = {Agricultural land-use change in Brazilian Amazonia between 1980 and
   1995: Evidence from integrated satellite and census data},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT},

Volume = {87},

Abstract = {As cropland and pasture have replaced forest and cerrado in Brazilian
   Amazonia, concern has mounted over the effects of changing the
   biogeochemical and hydrological properties of one of the world's great
   storehouses of biomass and biodiversity. Although much recent effort has
   focused on the location, effects, and causes of deforestation and
   cerrado conversion, much less is known about the basin-wide spatial
   distribution and density of the land use following conversion for crops
   or pasture.
   In this paper, we use census and satellite records to develop maps of
   the distribution and abundance of major agricultural land uses across
   4.5 x 10(8) ha of Brazilian Amazonia in 1980 and 1995. Results indicate
   an overall expansion of 7.0 x 10(6) ha in total agricultural area in
   Brazilian Amazonia between 1980 and 1995. The net change during this
   period is estimated for three different land-use types: croplands (an
   increase of 0.8 x 10(6) ha), natural pastures (a decrease of 8.4 x 10(6)
   ha), and planted pastures (an increase of 14.7 x 10(6) ha). These
   estimates, the first spatially explicit quantifications of agricultural
   land-use activities in 1980 and 1995 across Brazilian Amazonia, are
   shown to be consistent with the results of applying a land use change
   and secondary regrowth model to published deforestation rates for the
   period.
   The resulting time slices, presented for each land-use category at 5-min
   (similar to9 km) spatial resolution, allow for the quantification of
   land-use changes in this region for biogeochemical, demographic and
   economic models. Several foci of agricultural change existed within
   Brazilian Amazonia during this period: in the state of Pari, cropland
   was lost and planted pasture increased markedly; in Mato Grosso, both
   cropland and planted pasture increased; in Rondonia, planted pasture
   replacing forest was the primary route to agricultural expansion. (C)

Abstract = {Artisanal and small-scale gold mining (ASM) is becoming a significant
   cause of environmental degradation in tropical ecosystems. In this
   study, we conducted a rapid assessment on the impact of an ASM gold mine
   on the vocalizing avian and anuran communities in the buffer zone of the
   Tambopata National Reserve in Peru. We used seven audio recorders (three
   near an active mine, two in an abandoned mine, and two in an adjacent
   forest) to collect 2900 recordings to generate soundscapes and compare
   acoustic activity patterns of birds and anurans among sites. We
   identified 56 bird species during the morning chorus (05:00-07:00) and 9
   anurans species in the evening chorus (18:00-20:00). Bird species
   richness was similar between the forest (28 bird species), the abandoned
   mine (25 species) and the active mine (24 species), but species richness
   of birds sensitive to disturbance was much lower in the active mine. In
   contrast, anuran species richness was highest in the active mine (5
   species) and lowest in the forest (2 species). Results indicate that
   acoustic monitoring and soundscape analysis can be effective tools for
   evaluating the impact of mining activities on vocalizing species, and
   could become useful tools in rapid environmental impact assessments for
   mitigation and conservation strategies in ASM mining regions.},

Title = {Combined fire and grazing of surrounding grassland does not prevent
   saxicolous lichens growth},
Journal = {PLANT ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {148},
Number = {3},
Pages = {311-317},
Abstract = {Background and aims - The use of fire as a managing tool influences and
   maintains many types of vegetation and may determine landscape
   physiognomy and species composition. Fire has a strong effect on lichens
   but studies about their recolonization or resistance are rare.
   Considering this, the objectives of this study are to investigate how
   fire impacts the structure of saxicolous lichen communities on rocks in
   grassland, considering richness, cover and lichen taxa composition and
   to verify if there are changes on functional diversity and redundancy
   among sites with different fire events.
   Methods - The study was undertaken in an area composed of mosaics of
   native Araucaria forests and grasslands, in southern Brazil, where two
   sites were sampled. One of them experienced a recent intense fire
   episode, after being fifteen years without fire or grazing influence,
   and the other was regularly subjected to grazing and annual fire
   episodes.
   Key results - The sites differed in lichen cover, lichen taxa richness
   and composition. Regarding the environmental and structural variables of
   the surrounding vegetation, significant influence on saxicolous lichen
   communities was also observed, with taller vegetation and greater
   vegetation cover on the rocky outcrops from the site with only one and
   intense recent fire event. Functional diversity and functional
   redundancy was also significantly different between both sites.
   Conclusion - Based on these results it is possible to affirm that
   managing southern Brazilian natural grasslands with annual fire and
   grazing, unless it is not too intense, does not prevent the development
   of saxicolous lichen communities. The effect of fire on abandoned
   grasslands, with a high quantity of organic matter and taller
   vegetation, is importantly negative to saxicolous lichen community.
   Lichens take more time to grow and occupy the rock than the surrounding
   vegetation recovers, which can cause microclimate changes. The
   recolonization of these rocky outcrops can therefore take a long time
   and the new lichen community will probably never be the same as the
   former one.},

Abstract = {Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) are an important biotic factor that
   influences tropical ecological succession and differently affect the
   woody species belonging to different successional stages. However,
   little is known about the influence of AMF on growth and reproduction of
   herbaceous and shrubby species of early phases of tropical succession.
   Thus, we assessed the effect of AMF on the development of 27
   heliophilous herbaceous and shrubby tropical species. Plants were grown
   in greenhouse, in low-and high-fertility soils, with or without AMF, for
   100 d. Most species grown with AMF exhibited high root infection
   intensity (approximate to 80\%), irrespective of soil fertility. In the
   low-fertility soil, non-mycorrhizal plants exhibited about 88\% less
   shoot dry mass (SDM) than mycorrhizal plants, and AMF were crucial for
   the survival of most species. Non-mycorrhizal plants also had lower
   relative growth rate (RGR), total leaf area (TLA), leaf area expansion
   (LAE) and total root length (TRL). Six species flowered in the
   low-fertility soil, and flowering increased with AMF in one plant
   species and four species only flowered when mycorrhizal. In the
   high-fertility soil, non-mycorrhizal plants exhibited about 13\% less
   SDM than mycorrhizal plants and also exhibited lower TLA, LAE, and
   nutrient concentrations in shoots. On the other hand, no major changes
   were observed for RGR, TRL and root dry mass for most of the species.
   Sixteen plant species flowered in the high-fertility soil, but most had
   earlier (11) and more abundant (10) flowering when mycorrhizal. Thus,
   AMF have different influences on the survival, growth and flowering of
   herbaceous and shrubby tropical species, depending on soil fertility: in
   low-fertility soil, AMF especially affect the survival, growth and
   flowering, whereas in high-fertility soil, AMF mainly influence the
   shoot nutrient concentrations and flowering.},

Abstract = {Generally, palaeoenvironmental interpretations consider only allogenic
   processes, when autogenic factors may have a strong influence on proxies
   of stratigraphic sequences. For instance, the Holocene history of the
   vegetation along the southern littoral of the State of Bahia in
   north-eastern Brazil is characterized by mangrove dynamics controlled by
   allogenic processes. However, over smaller timescales (similar to
   700years), autogenic processes may have controlled vegetation dynamics
   and hence observed pollen distribution. This work proposes tidal channel
   dynamics as one of the main cause for changes in pollen assemblage along
   the studied stratigraphic profiles during the last centuries, based on
   sedimentology, pollen and elemental analysis (C-13, N-15 and C/N) and
   radiocarbon dating of sedimentary organic matter from two cores sampled
   from an abandoned meander and a tidal flat at the mouth of the Jucurucu
   River. One core was sampled from a mangrove formed during the past
   similar to 550cal yr bp. Another core recorded sediments in a varzea
   forest (swamp seasonally and permanently inundated by freshwater)
   located similar to 2.7km from the current shoreline, which displayed a
   maximum age of similar to 680cal yr bp. Two facies associations were
   identified: tidal channel (A) and tidal flat/oxbow lake (B). This work
   proposes allogenic processes as the main driving forces controlling the
   wetlands dynamics at the studied site during the Holocene. However, our
   data also reveal that part of the changes in vegetation over the last
   similar to 700years reflect tidal channels and tidal flats development,
   which represent autogenic processes. The change in timescale analysis
   from the Holocene to recent centuries may have weakened the influence of
   allogenic factors. However, this needs interpretation with reference to
   the spatial scale of the depositional environment as the larger the
   depositional system analyzed, the stronger the influence of autogenic
   processes on stratigraphic sequences over longer timescales. Copyright

Abstract = {From towers constructed at the interface between second-growth forest
   and an active and an abandoned pasture, we observed inter-habitat
   movements of fruit-eating birds in eastern Amazonia. The abandoned
   pasture was composed of grasses and forbs with a scattering of shrubs
   and small trees. The active pasture contained a low, uniform bed of
   grass. A total of 47 frugivorous bird species was recorded in the
   second-growth forest. We observed that 18 of these species frequented
   the adjacent abandoned pasture but only 3 were found in the adjacent
   active pasture. Fruit-eating birds flying from second-growth forest
   typically, spent only a few minutes in the abandoned pasture, and their
   movements were generally restricted to a pasture belt of 1-80 m along
   the border with the second-growth forest. Most inter-habitat movement
   occurred during the rainy season, which coincided with a peak in fruit
   availability in the abandoned pasture. Just three bird species,
   Ramphocelus carbo, Tachyphonus rufus, and Thraupis episcopus, accounted
   for all estimated 70\% of the total movement of frugivores between the
   second-growth forest and the abandoned pasture. All three species spent
   most of the time in the abandoned pasture foraging on shrubs and trees
   but exhibited differences in their preference for specific habitat
   elements and in their seed-defecation habits. All understanding of bird
   behaviors in altered landscapes provides important information to
   planners and policy makers concerned with protecting regional
   biodiversity, and maintaining landscape integrity. This research
   provides a rationale for placing limits on the size of clearings in the
   Brazilian Amazon.},

Abstract = {Capuchin monkeys are omnivorous platyrrhines with a high frequency of
   faunivory and can survive in urban forest fragments. Predation of wild
   vertebrates (high-quality foods) by capuchin monkeys has been frequently
   reported in many species of Cebus and Sapajus. However, predation of
   domestic animals is unknown. We describe a rare episode of predation,
   consumption, and sharing of an adult domestic chicken (Gallus gallus
   domesticus) by individuals from a social group of robust capuchin
   monkeys (Sapajus sp.) living in a small urban park in the city of Foz do
   Igua \& ccedil;u, southern Brazil. This relatively large prey is freely
   farmed at the study site. The capture, slaughter, preparation (removal
   of feathers from the body), and consumption of the prey by the capuchins
   lasted 22 min. The dominant adult male ate the chicken's head and
   tolerated the approach of two juveniles. The juveniles shared the
   remainder of the prey after the adult abandoned it. These juveniles
   scared other group members that approached the carcass. We recorded an
   opportunistic hunt for easily accessible domestic prey, a case of human
   resource use by urban primates that shared passively the atypical and
   valuable food. Though a rare event, the predation on a domestic animal
   indicates a potential source of conflict with humans that can have
   negative impacts on urban primates.},

Title = {A META-ANALYSIS OF PHYSICOCHEMICAL CHANGES IN THE RHIZOSPHERE AND BULK
   SOIL UNDER WOODLANDS},
Journal = {BIOSCIENCE JOURNAL},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {40},
Abstract = {Monoculture for timber production has been replacing natural
   environments as the demand for renewable energy sources increases. The
   lack of nutrient compensation may increase the risk of soil depletion,
   thus changing soil properties. To summarize the impact of forestry
   activities in edaphic environments, we present a meta -analysis on the
   rhizosphere effects of coniferous and broadleaved trees established as
   monoculture and natural regeneration on soil physicochemical properties.
   Records of soil attributes published in peer -reviewed journals from
   eight countries were collected. Clay content changed only in monoculture
   sites, decreasing 55.51\% in the rhizosphere, while silt and sand
   presented significant variations in both monoculture and naturally
   regenerated areas. Conifers affected the soil more than broadleaved
   trees, evidenced by higher pH reduction (-2.96\% vs. -1.98\%) and higher
   increase of Al3+ (197.43\% vs. 50.68\%), K+ (80.40\% vs. 69.90\%), CEC
   (24.61\% vs. 17.35\%), and total organic carbon (82.21\% vs. 69.89\%).
   Also, the rhizosphere affected regeneration soils more than monoculture,
   indicated by higher Al3+ (50.68\% vs. ns) and available P (32.31\% vs.
   ns), K+ (203.44\% vs. ns), CEC (34.90\% vs. 20.93), and total organic
   carbon (91.55\% vs. 63.23\%). These results indicate higher nutrient
   availability in naturally regenerated than monoculture sites, as higher
   species diversity and better plant litter quality are expected. This
   meta -analysis shows that coniferous and naturally regenerated trees had
   a higher influence on the rhizosphere and soil properties than
   broadleaved and monocultures. Management practices must be revisited to
   ensure the long-term sustainability of forestry activity, and studies in
   tropical zones must be intensified.},

Abstract = {In many tropical landscapes, agroforestry systems are the last forested
   ecosystems, providing shade, having higher humidity, mitigating
   potential droughts, and possessing more species than any other crop
   system. Here, we tested the hypothesis that higher levels of shade and
   associated humidity in agroforestry enhance coffee ant richness more
   during the dry than rainy season, comparing ant richness in 22 plots of
   three coffee agroforestry types in coastal Ecuador: simple-shade
   agroforests (intensively managed with low tree species diversity),
   complex-shade agroforests (extensively managed with intermediate tree
   species diversity) and abandoned coffee agroforests (abandoned for 10-15
   yr and resembling secondary forests). Seasonality affected responses of
   ant richness but not composition to agroforestry management, in that
   most species were observed in abandoned coffee agroforests in the dry
   season. In the rainy season, however, most species were found in
   simple-shade agroforests, and complex agroforestry being intermediate.
   Foraging coffee ants species composition did not change differently
   according to agroforestry type and season. Results show that shade
   appears to be most important in the dry seasons, while a mosaic of
   different land-use types may provide adequate environmental conditions
   to ant species, maximizing landscape-wide richness throughout the year.},

Abstract = {In the humid tropics of Latin America, considerable proportions of
   agro-scapes are covered with degraded pastures that were taken over by
   dense weedy shrub canopies hampering further forest succession. While
   tree seeds are still constantly dispersed by bats and birds, these often
   do not reach the soil but got stuck in the dense shrubby vegetation.
   While manual up-rooting of weedy shrubs or tree replantation is too
   expensive, we tested if burrowing pigs or trampling cattle can enhance
   proportions of bare soils for fallow restoration. These hypotheses were
   tested in on-farm experiments at Igarape-Acu, northeastern Para.
   Soil-opening effects of ten pigs (40 days + nights) and ten oxen (40
   overnight stays), respectively, were tested against manual clearing and
   control on three plots per treatment, respectively. Ground cover
   percentages of bare soil, weedy shrubs, grasses, and tree species were
   visually determined in 40 plots/treatment before and directly after
   treatments, and half a year later (n = 480 samples). Both animal
   treatments could not really match manual clearing (62\%) but pigs
   reached above 36\% bare ground cover, while cattle just 20\%. As pigs
   are almost omnipresent on Amazonian smallholdings and even give a modest
   economic refund, the use of pigs is recommended to smallholders who want
   to break up the lush weed layers for the benefit of forest restoration.},

Abstract = {Since 1980s, the settlement and occupancy into abandoned or
   non-cultivated land by poor peoples or landless peasantsbecame popular
   in Brazil. These people sometimes lack agricultural experiences to
   yieldsufficient production for livelihoods and it lead them to abandon
   the land and repeating forest clearance. Sufficient and sustainable
   agricultural production for subsistence and crop sale is important,
   especially during the early stage of immigration, in order to settlers
   to remain the land they had occupied. To elucidate the difference in
   crop selection tendencies between households with production sales and
   those without sales, we categorised the households within a single study
   area in Brazil into three types: (1) households with sales income from
   agricultural products (SA), and households without sales income in which
   the variety among cultivated crops was (2) low (NL) or (3) high (NH).
   The crops were divided into six types: (1) tubers and herbaceous crops
   that can be harvested within or around a year; tree crops that can be
   harvested within 3 years either (2) seasonally or (3) year-round; tree
   crops that can be harvested only after 4 years either (4) seasonally or
   (5) year-round; and (6) tree crops for timber, colouring, and oil use.
   Our survey results indicate that the SA households had a well-designed
   combination of crop species, including both commercial and subsistence
   crops, whereas the NH and NL households were lacking in short- and
   long-term sales. None of the NH had any sales income, even though they
   had the highest calculated number of calories coming from the
   consumption of agricultural products. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by

Abstract = {Fallow periods used in slash-and-burn agriculture in the Bragantina
   region, the oldest agricultural frontier in the Brazilian Amazon, are
   being reduced. The objective of this study was to analyze the effects of
   a shortened fallow period on the Bragantina landscape dynamics and
   equilibrium. Dynamics were characterized by landscape structural
   changes, particularly in the spatial distribution of secondary forests,
   and by transition matrix. Equilibrium was defined by temporal and
   spatial parameters, and by the increment of agricultural areas from 1985
   to 1996, analyzed with 6 LANDSAT-TM images. I worked with 6 areas of 250
   ha each, 3 with short fallow periods (2-4 years) and 3 with long fallow
   periods (about 10 years). Results showed that short fallow period areas
   did not present an equilibrium situation. In these areas, developed
   secondary vegetation tended to disappear and agricultural areas were
   being expanded at an average rate of 3\% per year. Landscape structure
   changes pointed out that a reduction in fallow period was occurring in
   already short fallow period areas. Long fallow period areas presented a
   shifting mosaic steady-state condition, where punctual changes due to
   agricultural uses were compensated by field abandonment rate. Both
   agricultural uses and field abandonment rates were lower in long fallow
   period areas when compared with short ones. Comparisons with indigenous
   traditional cropping-fallow cycles indicate that sustainable conditions
   could be maintained with 11 years of fallow for each cropping year,
   while shorter cycles would break down the system if agricultural
   improvements are not implemented.},

   assessments identified extreme new soil conditions with low chemical and
   physical fertility, characterized by coarse texture and rock fragments,
   which hinder revegetation, especially during prolonged dry seasons.
   These degraded soils were classified as Entisols and Technosols
   according to Soil Taxonomy and the World Reference Base. Over time,
   natural regeneration and plantations improved soil formation, aligning
   with recognized soil classification systems. Under current management
   practices, restoration planning should prioritize selected shrub and
   tree species, and consider soil amendments to initiate soil recovery.
   This approach aligns with self-sustaining successional stages and
   contributes to the objectives of Land Degradation Neutrality,
   Appropriate Mitigation and Adaptation Actions, and Sustainable
   Development Goals.},

Title = {Observations of albedo and radiation balance over postforest land

Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLIMATE},
Year = {1997},
Volume = {10},
Number = {5},

Abstract = {Regional climatic change, including significant reductions in Amazon
   Basin evaporation and precipitation, has been predicted by numerical
   simulations of total tropical forest removal. These results have been
   shown to be very sensitive to the prescription of the albedo shift
   associated with conversion from forest to a replacement land cover.
   Modelers have so far chosen to use an `'impoverished grassland''
   scenario to represent the postforest land surface. This choice maximizes
   the shifts in land surface parameters, especially albedo (fraction of
   incident shortwave radiation reflected by the surface). Recent surveys
   show secondary vegetation to be the dominant land cover for some
   deforested areas of the Amazon. The characteristics of secondary
   vegetation as well as agricultural land covers other than pasture have
   received little attention from field scientists in the region. This
   paper presents the results of field measurements of radiation flux over
   various deforested surfaces on a small farm in the eastern Amazonian
   state of Para. The albedo of fields in active use was as high as 0.176,
   slightly less than the 0.180 recently determined for Amazonian pasture
   and substantially less than the 0.19 commonly used in GCM simulations of
   deforestation. For 10-yr-old secondary vegetation, albedo was 0.135,
   practically indistinguishable from the recently published mean primary
   forest albedo of 0.134. Measurements of surface temperature and net
   radiation show that, despite similarity in albedo, secondary vegetation
   differs from primary forest in energy and mass exchange. The elevation
   of midday surface temperature above air temperature was found to be
   greatest for actively and recently farmed land, declining with time
   since abandonment. Net radiation was correspondingly lower for fields in
   active or recent use. Using land cover analyses of the region
   surrounding the study area for 1984, 1988, and 1991, the pace of change
   in regional-mean albedo is estimated to have declined and appears to be
   leveling at a value less than 0.03 above that of the original forest
   cover.},

Abstract = {Movement ecology is an important tool for understanding animal behaviour
   toward basic needs, as well as to design conservation and management
   priorities. Animals usually do not move randomly and may prefer certain
   types of habitats over others. The yellow anaconda (Eunectes notaeus) is
   one of the largest snakes in South America. However, little is known
   about its natural history. Here, we present results from a telemetry
   study to quantify movement patterns and habitat use of eight yellow
   anacondas in a protected, seasonally flooded area in Midwestern Brazil.
   Yellow anacondas were associated to small channels with macrophyte
   stands and bushy vegetation. They moved relatively little (188 m
   monthly) and had small home range (mean 6.2 ha); they used native
   pastures and abandoned farmlands with forest patches more than expected
   by chance. Our results contribute to the understanding of dispersal
   patterns, habitat choices, and life history of this large aquatic snake
   and to the body of knowledge needed for management and conservation of
   its populations and habitats.},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The traditional agricultural system of Brazil is based on speculative
   gain and invested in monoculture. This is marked by 4 periods: (1) sugar
   period of 16th and 17th centuries; (2) gold and diamond mining of 18th
   century; (3) coffee planting of the 19th century terminating in 1930;
   (4) speculation in rubber, cacao, oranges, sisal, etc. The basic support
   of rural settlement is pasturing of cattle. The terrain is hilly to
   mountainous. Current trends indicate that in spite of an increasingly
   rapid migration from rural districts into expanding cities, the rural
   population has continued to grow. Crop production has risen but the
   productivity of the individual rural farm worker is low, and declining
   because of the persistent use of manual implements. Agriculture is thus
   wasteful, inefficient and costly. When production drops the land is
   abandoned to pasturage. With the destruction of tropical forest closest
   to urban markets by exploitative practices, there is a continued rise of
   food prices due to transportation costs. The traditional system of land
   rotation is destroying a large part of the virgin areas, and the end of
   uncut tropical forest is in sight. Scientific farming has been
   demonstrated in Brazil, but since there are no speculative profits,
   little capital is invested. Application of the principles of scientific
   agriculture might change the pattern of cultivation. Although scientific
   farming is feasible and will increase productivity and lower the cost of
   food production, it will decrease population in thinly centered areas
   and make for a further concentration in the already densely populated
   places.},

Abstract = {The critically endangered black-faced lion tamarin, Leontopithecus
   caissara, has a restricted geographical distribution consisting of small
   mainland and island populations, each with distinct habitats in coastal
   southeastern Brazil. Necessary conservation management actions require
   an assessment of whether differences in habitats are reflected in use of
   space by the species. We studied two tamarin groups on the mainland at
   Sao Paulo state between August 2005 and March 2007, and compared the
   results with data from Superagui Island. Three home range estimators
   were used: minimum convex polygon (MCP), Kernel, and the new technique
   presented dissolved monthly polygons (DMP). These resulted,
   respectively, in home ranges of 345, 297, and 282 ha for the 12-month
   duration of the study. Spatial overlap of mainland groups was extensive,
   whereas temporal overlap was not, a pattern that indicates resource
   partitioning is an important strategy to avoid intraspecific
   competition. L. caissara large home ranges seem to be dynamic, with
   constant incorporation of new areas and abandonment of others through
   time. The main difference between mainland and island groups is the
   amount and variety of sleeping sites. A better understanding of the home
   range sizes, day range lengths, and territorial behavior of this species
   will aid in developing better management strategies for its protection.
   Additionally, the presented DMP protocol is a useful improvement over
   the MCP method as it results in more realistic home range sizes for
   wildlife species. Am. J. Primatol. 73: 1114-1126, 2011. (C) 2011 Wiley

Abstract = {One of the greatest threats to the Brazilian Amazon is the
   reconstruction and paving of the formerly abandoned Highway BR-319,
   which would link one of the most conserved blocks in the Amazon forest
   to the ``arc of deforestation{''} on the southern edge of the region
   where most forest has already been destroyed. BR-319 and its planned
   side roads would allow the actors and processes from the arc of
   deforestation to move into vast areas of unprotected rainforest. In the
   specific case of this highway, a judicial decision that is not subject
   to further appeal established that environmental studies for the first
   section of the highway to be reconstructed ({''}Lot C{''}) must be
   carried out before paving. The federal highway department and the
   ``Civil House{''} of President Bolsonaro's presidential office ignored
   this decision and issued a call for bids for the construction work. Due
   to the current lack of governance in the BR-319 area and the history of
   deforestation whenever Amazonian highways are built, the decision on
   whether to suspend the contract for the ``Lot C{''} is critical for the
   maintenance of both the ecosystem services of the Amazon forest and the
   way of life of indigenous and riverside people. This decision is
   expected to be made shortly by a single person.},

Abstract = {The Brazilian Cerrado is one of the most biodiverse savannas in the
   world, yet 46\% of its original cover has been cleared to make way for
   crops and pastures. These extensive land-use transitions (LUTs) are
   expected to influence regional climate by reducing evapotranspiration
   (ET), increasing land surface temperature (LST), and ultimately reducing
   precipitation. Here, we quantify the impacts of LUTs on ET and LST in
   the Cerrado by combining MODIS satellite data with annual land use and
   land cover maps from 2006 to 2019. We performed regression analyses to
   quantify the effects of six common LUTs on ET and LST across the entire
   gradient of Cerrado landscapes, Results indicate that clearing forests
   for cropland or pasture increased average LST by similar to 3.5 degrees
   C and reduced mean annual ET by 44\% and 39\%, respectively. Transitions
   from woody savannas to cropland or pasture increased average LST by 1.9
   degrees C and reduced mean annual ET by 27\% and 21\%, respectively.
   Converting native grasslands to cropland or pasture increased average
   LST by 0.9 and 0.6 degrees C, respectively. Conversely,
   grasslandto-pasture transitions increased mean annual ET by 15\%. To
   date, land changes have caused a 10\% reduction in water recycled to the
   atmosphere annually and a 0.9 degrees C increase in average LST across
   the biome, compared to the historic baseline under native vegetation.
   Global climate changes from increased atmospheric greenhouse gas
   concentrations will only exacerbate these effects. Considering potential
   future scenarios, we found that abandoning deforestation control
   policies or allowing legal deforestation to continue (at least 28.4 Mha)
   would further reduce yearly ET (by -9\% and -3\%, respectively) and
   increase average LST (by +0.7 and +0.3 degrees C, respectively) by 2050.
   In contrast, policies encouraging zero deforestation and restoration of
   the 5.2 Mha of illegally deforested areas would partially offset the
   warming and drying impacts of land-use change.},

   reference area of Native Forest (NF) and three managed areas: Permanent
   Pasture (PP), Direct Sowing b(DS), and an area of Private Natural
   Heritage Reserve (PNHR) in the process of natural regeneration. Soil
   samples from the 0.0-0.05, 0.05-0.10, and 0.10-0.20 m layers were
   collected to assess soil density (Sd), TOC contents, with subsequent
   calculations of the stratification index (SI), carbon stock (StockC),
   and variation of the total organic carbon stock (A,StockC), in addition
   to the determination of daily emission and calculation of total C-CO2
   accumulation. The NF area had the highest levels and stocks of TOC,
   reaching 16.42 g kg-1 and 20.90 Mg ha-1, respectively. On the other
   hand, the PP and PNHR areas had the lowest content and StockC. The areas
   of PP, DS, PNHR, and NF presented SI values of 1.08, 1.13, 1.32, and
   1.61, respectively. The NF area showed higher peaks and a higher total
   accumulation of C-CO2, inferring the highest biological activity in this
   area. By multivariate analysis, none of the managed areas was close to
   the NF in quality. The worst results considering the evaluated
   attributes were observed in the areas of PP and PNHR due to the stage of
   degradation of these areas as a result of exploration and land use

   wet and dry seasons in 1997. Ten anuran, five lizard, and three snake
   species were captured in plots over the study. Assemblage composition
   was most similar at logged and unlogged sites. The logged forest
   herpetofauna had higher species richness and abundance than the unlogged
   forest, but diversity was greater in the unlogged forest due to greater
   evenness. In contrast, the pine plantation site had the highest
   richness, abundance, and evenness of the three study sites, but species
   composition was distinct from the other areas. Herpetofaunal densities
   were significantly lower in all three areas during the dry season than
   in the wet season. During the dry season, soil moisture, litter mass,
   topography, shrub cover, and number of fallen logs were significant
   positive predictors of herpetofaunal presence in litter plots, but only
   soil moisture was significant in the wet season. The interaction of
   moisture and topography appears to be important in determining seasonal
   patterns of litter herpetofaunal distribution. Comparison of litter
   herpetofaunal studies across the tropics have shown that mid-elevation
   faunas generally support fewer species than lowland faunas. Compared
   with other tropical mid-elevation litter faunas, Kibale supports an
   intermediate number of species, but at lower densities than observed at
   any other mid-elevation site reported in the literature.},

Title = {Multifunctional shade-tree management in tropical agroforestry
   landscapes - a review},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY},
Year = {2011},

Abstract = {P>1. Agricultural intensification reduces ecological resilience of
   land-use systems, whereas paradoxically, environmental change and
   climate extremes require a higher response capacity than ever.
   Adaptation strategies to environmental change include maintenance of
   shade trees in tropical agroforestry, but conversion of shaded to
   unshaded systems is common practice to increase short-term yield.
   2. In this paper, we review the short-term and long-term ecological
   benefits of shade trees in coffee Coffea arabica, C. canephora and cacao
   Theobroma cacao agroforestry and emphasize the poorly understood,
   multifunctional role of shade trees for farmers and conservation alike.
   3. Both coffee and cacao are tropical understorey plants. Shade trees in
   agroforestry enhance functional biodiversity, carbon sequestration, soil
   fertility, drought resistance as well as weed and biological pest
   control. However, shade is needed for young cacao trees only and is less
   important in older cacao plantations. This changing response to shade
   regime with cacao plantation age often results in a transient role for
   shade and associated biodiversity in agroforestry.
   4. Abandonment of old, unshaded cacao in favour of planting young cacao
   in new, thinned forest sites can be named `short-term cacao
   boom-and-bust cycle', which counteracts tropical forest conservation. In
   a `long-term cacao boom-and-bust cycle', cacao boom can be followed by
   cacao bust due to unmanageable pest and pathogen levels (e.g. in Brazil
   and Malaysia). Higher pest densities can result from physiological
   stress in unshaded cacao and from the larger cacao area planted.
   Risk-averse farmers avoid long-term vulnerability of their agroforestry
   systems by keeping shade as an insurance against insect pest outbreaks,
   whereas yield-maximizing farmers reduce shade and aim at short-term
   monetary benefits.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Sustainable agroforestry management needs
   to conserve or create a diverse layer of multi-purpose shade trees that
   can be pruned rather than removed when crops mature. Incentives from
   payment-for-ecosystem services and certification schemes encourage
   farmers to keep high to medium shade tree cover. Reducing pesticide
   spraying protects functional agrobiodiversity such as antagonists of
   pests and diseases, pollinating midges determining cacao yields and
   pollinating bees enhancing coffee yield. In a landscape perspective,
   natural forest alongside agroforestry allows noncrop-crop spillover of a
   diversity of functionally important organisms. Knowledge transfer
   between farmers, agronomists and ecologists in a participatory approach
   helps to encourage a shade management regime that balances economic and
   ecological needs and provides a `diversified food-and-cash crop'
   livelihood strategy.},

Pages = {265-274},
Abstract = {The South American Cerrado is a world biodiversity hotspot and at the
   same time is one of the fastest degrading biomes on Earth. About half of
   the original vegetation cover of the Cerrado has been converted to
   agriculture, pasture, urban area, and infrastructure. There are 223
   non-native plant species known to be naturalized in the Cerrado, which
   is equivalent to almost 2\% of the flora of the biome. Among those
   plants, at least 56 species are considered invasive. There are also 13
   species of flies, pertaining to the family Drosophilidae, that have been
   introduced from other biogeographical regions. These insects are
   equivalent to approximately 10\% of the total drosophilid insects in the
   biome. In this chapter, we review the primary literature on species
   invasions in the Cerrado and discuss how invasions might be contributing
   to biotic homogenization with a focus on grasses and flies. Existing
   research suggests that current high levels of habitat conversion and
   degradation, associated with low levels of conservation efforts, imply
   that the Cerrado is becoming dominated by non-native species, either in
   the form of cultivated crops and pasture, naturalized, or invasive
   species. It also suggests that more native species are increasingly
   threatened by extinction due to habitat losses. Furthermore, there are
   numerous abandoned and unrestored pastures inside national parks and
   other reserves. Through invasions and extinctions, biotic homogenization
   increases the similarity of biotas. Hence, there is an urgent need to
   increase both awareness and management efforts to reduce the threat
   posed by invasive species and habitat losses.},

Abstract = {There is little information about variation in growth, wood density and
   carbon concentration in native tree and shrub species in Africa. This
   information is needed to make realistic projections about carbon
   sequestration of different species in different environments. Farmers
   manage natural regeneration of many native species in the drylands of
   Niger, so there is interest in carbon sequestration potential of the
   species. The objectives of this study were to determine: (1) if tree
   height, stem diameter, mean ring width, wood density and carbon
   concentration differ among five tree and shrub species (Combretum
   glutinosum, Combretum micranthum, Combretum nigricans, Guiera
   senegalensis, Piliostigma reticulatum) in Niger; (2) if variation within
   species is affected by land use type (parkland agroforests, woodlands),
   soil type (sandy, rocky), terrain type (temporarily flooded, flat, hill
   slope) and mean annual rainfall; and (3) if growth variables, wood
   density and carbon concentration are correlated in the five species.
   Environmental variables did not have strong effects on growth and wood
   variables of the species, and some effects differed among species.
   Height across species increased with mean annual rainfall. Stem diameter
   and mean ring width across species were greater in parkland agroforests
   than in woodlands. Carbon concentration was positively correlated with
   growth variables of four species, but was not correlated with wood
   density in most species. Correlations between wood density and growth
   differed in sign among some species. We conclude that above-ground
   carbon sequestration per tree probably increases with mean annual
   rainfall and is greater in parkland agroforests than in woodlands.},

Abstract = {Respiratory diseases reach one of the main systems of the human body and
   affect a large part of the Brazilian population. In severe cases, they
   can limit the functionalities and the muscular strength of the disease
   carriers, decreasing their quality of life, because of the impact on
   simple daily activities. Pulmonary Rehabilitation Programs help to treat
   these diseases. The Pulmonary Rehabilitation Program of Feevale
   University helps patients with chronic respiratory diseases in the
   community and aims to improve their quality of life through the
   development of educational and assistance actions. The information about
   the patients and the treatment results are stored in a database. The
   amount of data disturbs the analysis of results. Through of a systematic
   review, it was possible to see that does not exist a model to predict
   abandonment trends of patients in Pulmonary Rehabilitation Programs.
   Therefore, this paper proposes a model to apply machine learning
   techniques in the database of the Pulmonary Rehabilitation Program of
   Feevale University. The model aims to identify the abandonment trends of
   patients entering the treatment and to extract knowledge about this
   database to contribute to the application of pulmonary rehabilitation
   treatment. In addition, this paper presents the development of a tool to
   apply the model proposed and provides visualizations to assist reading
   the data and results by healthcare professionals. The Support Vector
   Machine, Decision Tree and Random Forest techniques were compared. A
   predictive model created with the Random Forest technique demonstrated
   the best performance in the abandonment predictions, reaching 69.82\% of
   accuracy. Thus, it is possible to use machine learning to predict
   abandonment trends of patients in Pulmonary Rehabilitation Programs.},

Abstract = {The harvest of plant parts and exudates from wild populations
   contributes to the income, food security and livelihoods of many
   millions of people worldwide. Frankincense, an aromatic resin sourced
   from natural populations of Boswellia trees and shrubs, has been
   cherished by world societies for centuries. Boswellia populations are
   threatened by over-exploitation and ecosystem degradation, jeopardizing
   future resin production. Here, we reveal evidence of population collapse
   of B. papyrifera- now the main source of frankincense-throughout its
   geographic range. Using inventories of 23 populations consisting of
   21,786 trees, growth-ring data from 202 trees and demographic models on
   the basis of 7,246 trees, we find that over 75\% of studied populations
   lack small trees, natural regeneration has been absent for decades, and
   projected frankincense production will be halved in 20 yr. These changes
   are caused by increased human population pressure on Boswellia woodlands
   through cattle grazing, frequent burns and reckless tapping. A
   literature review showed that other Boswellia species experience similar
   threats. Populations can be restored by establishing cattle exclosures
   and fire-breaks, and by planting trees and tapping trees more carefully.
   Concerted conservation and restoration efforts are urgently needed to
   secure the long-term availability of this iconic product.},

Abstract = {Aim To investigate the influence of Holocene climatic and human-induced
   changes on a region of high biodiversity in southern Peruvian Amazonia.
   Location Four palaeoecological records from separate lakes within a lake
   district close to the modern city of Puerto Maldonado, Peru.
   Results The lakes provide a palaeoecological record spanning the last
   8200 years. A mid-Holocene dry event is documented in all of the records
   that extend back > 6000 years. The dry event appears to have lasted from
   c. 7200 yr BP until c. 3300 yr Bp. The onset of wetter conditions
   coincides with the formation of the youngest of the four lakes. The
   earliest occupation of these sites is inferred from the presence of
   charcoal at 7200 yr Bp, and the first crop pollen is found at 3630 yr
   Bp. Lakes that were regularly occupied were colonized soon after they
   formed. A reduction in charcoal concentration and the absence of crop
   pollen after c. 500 BP in all lakes is consistent with site abandonment
   following conquest.
   Main conclusions The mid-Holocene dry event is suggested to be part of a
   time-transgressive drying that tracked from north to south in both the
   Andes and the Amazon lowlands. The last millennium may represent the
   period of highest sustained lake levels within the Holocene. The
   proximity of the four lakes allows a landscape-scale analysis of the
   spatial extent of human disturbance centred on a known site of human
   occupation and reveals the highly localized nature of pre-Columbian
   anthropogenic disturbance in Amazonian landscapes. Inferences regarding
   widespread pre-Columbian landscape modification by indigenous peoples
   must take into account key site attributes, such as seasonality and
   proximity to rivers.},

Abstract = {The temporal evolution of L-band microwave backscatter for several land
   cover types in the Tapajo's National Forest is analysed using JERS-1.
   Five images were acquired from 1993 to 1997. Samples of the studied land
   cover types were identified after analysis of a Landsat Thematic Mapper
   (TM) dataset of 12 images obtained from 1984 to 1999. The following land
   cover types were investigated: bare soil, agriculture, pastures, forest
   regrowth from 1 to 23-year-old and primary forest. Backscatter behaviour
   of regrowth stands is influenced by the previous land use and by human
   impacts such as fire and selective logging. This selective logging can
   be mechanized or not, because people who live in the Amazon usually cut
   trees to build houses, bridges, fences, etc. Backscatter of young
   regrowth stands on sites immediately abandoned after slash and burn
   increases at a faster rate than young regrowth on sites abandoned after
   some years of agriculture. Backscatter of old regrowth stands also
   behaves differently where there are disturbances such as fire or
   selective logging. In the presence of such disturbances, one finds an
   oscillating pattern over time, while undisturbed forest shows either a
   progressive trend or a stable pattern, depending on the age of the
   stand.},

Abstract = {Most of Brazilian Amazonia faces important limitations for conventional
   agriculture and pastures due to a generally poor chemical fertility as
   well as the region's environmental conditions, especially high
   temperature and moisture. Without proper management, degradation of the
   soil and resulting unsustainability of agricultural and ranching
   production occur within a few years, leading to land abandonment. Use of
   perennial crops, especially those based on native tree species, would be
   instrumental in order to achieve best management such as that which
   assure recycling processes similar to those in the primary forest.
   Recommended alternative land uses are those producing high soil organic
   matter, recycling of nutrients, substantial agricultural production, and
   economic viability. These include agroforestry systems, enrichment of
   second growth with valuable native timber or fruit species, accelerated
   fallow regrowth via enrichment plantings, sequential agroforestry with
   slash-and-mulch, and diversified forest plantations. Improvement of
   agricultural soils can be based on lessons learned from the study of
   processes involved in the formation and maintenance of the rich ``dark
   earths{''} (terra preta), which owe their high carbon content and
   fertility in part to high content of charcoal. Adding powdered charcoal
   combined with selected nutrients can increase soil carbon in modern
   agriculture. Considering that limitations to expansion of intensified
   land uses in Amazonia are serious, regional development should emphasize
   the natural forest, which can maintain itself without external inputs of
   nutrients. Instead of creating conditions to further expand
   deforestation, these forests may be used as they stand to provide a
   variety of valuable environmental services that could offer a
   sustainable basis for development of Amazonia.},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Succession is defined as a directional change in species populations,
   the community, and the ecosystem at a site following a disturbance.
   Succession is a fundamental concept in ecology as it links different
   disciplines. An improved understanding of succession is urgently needed
   in the Anthropocene to predict the widespread effects of global change
   on succession and ecosystem recovery, but a comprehensive successional
   framework (CSF) is lacking. A CSF is needed to synthesize results, draw
   generalizations, advance successional theory, and make improved
   decisions for ecosystem restoration. We first show that succession is an
   integral part of socio-ecological system dynamics and that it is driven
   by social and ecological factors operating at different spatial scales,
   ranging from the patch to the globe. We then present a CSF at the local
   scale (patch and landscape) at which succession takes place and explain
   the underlying successional processes and mechanisms operating at that
   scale. The CSF reflects the increasingly broader perspective on
   succession and includes recent theoretical advances by not only focusing
   on species replacement but also on ecosystem development, considering
   succession as part of a socio-ecological system, and taking the effect
   of past and current land use, the landscape context, biotic
   interactions, and feedback loops into account. We discuss how the CSF
   can be used to integrate and synthesize successional studies, and its
   implications for ecosystem restoration.},

Abstract = {Tropical forest countries are struggling with the partially conflicting
   policy objectives of socioeconomic development, forest conservation, and
   safeguarding the livelihoods of local forest-dependent people. We worked
   with communities in the lower Tapajs region of the central Brazilian
   Amazon for over 10 years to understand their traditional and present
   land use practices, the constraints, and decision making processes
   imposed by their biophysical, socioeconomic, and political environment,
   and to facilitate development trajectories to improve the livelihoods of
   forest communities while conserving the forest on the farms and in the
   larger landscape. The work focused on riverine communities initially in
   the Tapajs National Forest and then in the Tapajs-Arapiuns Extractive
   Reserve. These communities have a century-old tradition of planting
   rubber agroforests which despite their abandonment during the 1990s
   still widely characterize the vegetation of the river banks, especially
   in the two protected areas where they are safe from the recent expansion
   of mechanized rice and soybean agriculture. The project evolved from the
   capacity-building of communities in techniques to increase the
   productivity of the rubber agroforests without breaking their low-input
   and low-risk logic, to the establishment of a community enterprise that
   allowed reserve inhabitants to reforest their own land with tree species
   of their choice and sell reforestation (not carbon) credits to local
   timber companies while retaining the ownership of the trees. By making
   land use practices economically more viable and ecologically more
   appropriate for protected areas, the project shows ways to strengthen
   the system of extractive and sustainable development reserves that
   protects millions of hectares of Amazon forest with the consent of the
   communities that inhabit them.},

   located at the Serra do Cipo, southeastern Brazil. Seedling survival,
   biomass partitioning and growth rate were recorded every 15 days,
   between 30 and 90 days after transplanting in soils with increasing
   nutritional availability. We found reduced seedling survival and higher
   biomass accumulation and growth rate with increasing nutrient
   availability indicating a clear trade-off between these parameters.
   There are evidences that the high phenotypic variability shown by B.
   dracunculifolia seedlings may play an important role in the capacity of
   this species to colonize disturbed areas with contrasting nutrient

Abstract = {The floristic composition of the rupestrian grasslands comprises a
   mosaic of species with different adaptations exhibiting high diversity
   and endemism. However, the plant species from rupestrian grasslands are
   dependent on site-specific conditions and their reproduction is almost
   always limited, making natural regeneration after disturbances
   difficult. The soil seed bank represents a potential factor for the
   regeneration of this environment. The objective was to evaluate the soil
   seed bank of different depths of a rupestrian grassland area, collected
   in two climatic seasons and submitted to different light conditions. The
   samples composed of litter and soil (0-5 cm) were collected in 13 plots
   of 100 m(2), in a rupestrian grassland area in Serra do Cipo (Minas
   Gerais state), in dry and rainy seasons. The samples were subjected to
   full sun and shading conditions. In total, 185 seedlings of 31 species
   and nine botanical families emerged. The richest families were
   Cyperaceae, Poaceae and Asteraceae. There was variation in richness,
   abundance and floristic composition among the soil strata, but no
   variation was observed in relation to seasonality and light conditions.
   The soil samples presented higher values of the evaluated parameters in
   relation to those ones of litter, showing that the seed bank is more
   representative in the soil stratum. These results demonstrate that there
   is potential for rupestrian grassland regenerations through the seed
   bank, especially the soil stratum.},

Volume = {10},

Abstract = {The spatial distribution of human activities in forest frontier regions
   is strongly influenced by transportation infrastructure. With the
   planned paving of 6000 km of highway in the Amazon Basin, agricultural
   frontier expansion will follow, triggering potentially large changes in
   the location and rate of deforestation. We developed a land-cover change
   simulation model that is responsive to road paving and policy
   intervention scenarios for the BR-163 highway in central Amazonia. This
   corridor links the cities of Cuiaba, in central Brazil, and Santarem, on
   the southern margin of the Amazon River. It connects important soybean
   production regions and burgeoning population centers in Mato Grosso
   State with the international port of Santarem, but 1000 km of this road
   are still not paved. It is within this context that the Brazilian
   government has prioritized the paving of this road to turn it into a
   major soybean exportation facility. The model assesses the impacts of
   this road paving within four scenarios: two population scenarios (high
   and moderate growth) and two policy intervention scenarios. In the
   `business-as-usual' policy scenario, the responses of deforestation and
   land abandonment to road paving are estimated based on historical rates
   of Amazon regions that had a major road paved. In the `governance'
   scenario, several plausible improvements in the enforcement of
   environmental regulations, support for sustainable land-use systems, and
   local institutional capacity are invoked to modify the historical rates.
   Model inputs include data collected during expeditions and through
   participatory mapping exercises conducted with agents from four major
   frontier types along the road. The model has two components. A
   scenario-generating submodel is coupled to a landscape dynamics
   simulator, `DINAMICA', which spatially allocates the land-cover
   transitions using a GIS database. The model was run for 30 years,
   divided into annual time steps. It predicted more than twice as much
   deforestation along the corridor in business-as-usual vs. governance
   scenarios. The model demonstrates how field data gathered along a 1000
   km corridor can be used to develop plausible scenarios of future
   land-cover change trajectories that are relevant to both global change
   science and the decision-making process of governments and civil society
   in an important rainforest region.},

Title = {Global potential assessment of available land for bioenergy projects in
   2050 within food security limits},
Journal = {LAND USE POLICY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {105},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {This paper evaluates the potential of available land area for bioenergy
   projects in 2050 without compromising food security. The paper?s novelty
   is the qualitative and quantitative assessment of parameters interfering
   with land availability for bioenergy projects. Unlike previous studies,
   the projections consider food waste, areas of degraded or abandoned land
   due to low productivity, and parameters generally overlooked by other
   authors, such as urban agriculture and insect protein consumption.
   Population?s food demand, agricultural productivity changes, and surplus
   land availability for biofuel production are bases for the methods
   employed. Three (3) different scenarios were defined: business as usual
   (Pessimistic Scenario - CP), the best of the realistic scenarios
   (Optimistic Conservative Scenario - CC), and the ideal situation (Ideal
   Scenario - CC). The authors did not consider social segmentation
   variations in land access, characterizing a weakness of the study.
   Projections disregard economic and market influences governing land use
   and distribution. Despite the risks to biodiversity because of
   agricultural frontiers? expansion, there is enough arable land in the
   world to feed the population in 2050 in the three proposed scenarios.
   However, choosing to prioritize forest preservation and going for
   shrubland areas as the next agricultural frontiers, no arable land would
   remain in the Pessimistic Scenario for biofuels. Otherwise, agriculture
   would cause deforestation of 24\% of forest area (935 million hectares)
   and causing massive environmental impacts. In the Optimistic
   Conservative Scenario, 5.7\% of agricultural land would remain,
   supplying 92\% of the 2100 target, and in the Ideal Scenario, 42.0\% of
   agricultural land would remain, with the potential of reach the 2100
   target more than 6 times. Bioenergy could contribute to 5?17.7\% of the
   global energy matrix in the most realistic scenarios.},

Title = {Responses of transplanted native tree species to invasive alien grass
   removals in an abandoned cattle pasture in the Lacandon region, Mexico},
Journal = {TROPICAL CONSERVATION SCIENCE},

Volume = {5},

Pages = {192-207},
Abstract = {We tested the early performance of 16 native early-, mid-, and
   late-successional tree species in response to four intensities of grass
   removal in an abandoned cattle pasture dominated by the introduced,
   invasive African grass, Cynodon plectostachyus, within the Lacandon
   rainforest region, southeast Mexico. The increase in grass removals
   significantly improved the performance of many species, especially of
   early-and mid-successional species, while performance of
   late-successional species was relatively poor and did not differ
   significantly among treatments. Good site preparation and at least one
   additional grass removal four months after seedling transplant were
   found to be essential; additional grass removals led to improved
   significantly performance of saplings in most cases. In order to
   evaluate the potential of transplanting tree seedlings successfully in
   abandoned tropical pastures, we developed a ``planting risk index{''},
   combining field performance measurements and plantation cost
   estimations. Our results showed a great potential for establishing
   restoration plantings with many early-and mid-successional species.
   Although planting risk of late-successional species was considered high,
   certain species showed some possibilities of acclimation after 18 months
   and should be considered in future plantation arrangements in view of
   their long-term contributions to biodiversity maintenance and also to
   human welfare through delivery of ecosystem services. Conducting a
   planting risk analysis can help avoid failure of restoration strategies
   involving simultaneous planting of early-, mid-, and late-successional
   tree species. This in turn will improve cost-effectiveness of initial
   interventions in large-scale, long-term restoration programs.},

Abstract = {Morphologies related to paleochannels are widespread through large areas
   of the Brazilian Amazonia. Despite the relevance for reconstructing the
   evolution of the largest fluvial system on Earth, detailed mapping of
   most of these features is still unavailable. The lack of works
   emphasizing Amazonian paleochannels represents an enormous bias toward
   the understanding of both migrating dynamics of Amazonian rivers through
   time and processes (e.g. tectonics, climate, sea-level fluctuation) that
   might have promoted channel abandonment. A few previous studies have
   demonstrated the successful application of digital elevation model (DEM)
   collected during the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) for mapping
   morphologies related to paleochannels still preserved under forested
   lowland Amazonian areas. The present study applies different remote
   sensing techniques, including JERS-1 90m, SAR/SIPAM-6m, Landsat, and
   ASTER, to successfully unravel a myriad of paleochannels in Marajo
   Island (Amazon mouth), which were previously undetected using solely
   SRTM data. The results presented in this work are promising for mapping
   paleodrainage in other forested areas of the Amazonas basin. Considering
   the several problems involved on data acquisition aiming to approach the
   evolution of Amazonian rivers in space and time (e.g. large dimension,
   lack of natural geological exposures, difficult access, dense forest
   cover, and high cloud volume), a proper mapping of Amazonas
   paleodrainage using different remote sensing techniques is crucial to
   visualize potential paleochannel morphologies and patterns that are of
   high relevance for reconstructing the Amazonian fluvial dynamics through
   time. Copyright (C) 2010 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Journal = {RESTORATION ECOLOGY},
Year = {2024},

Abstract = {Knowledge on seed ecology is foundational for effective seed-based
   restoration including seedling production, direct seed sowing, topsoil
   transplant, and natural regeneration. Consequently, quantifying
   available knowledge and biases in seed-based research allows
   practitioners to better plan and implement seed-based restoration
   programs and identify research priorities. Using a systematic review
   comprising 45 papers, 401 species, and 2,415 case studies, we provide an
   overview of seed ecology research in the Pantanal, the world's largest
   tropical wetland. We identified geographic, taxonomic, and ecological
   biases, as well as knowledge gaps in seed functions including
   production, dispersal, dormancy, germination, predation, and stress
   tolerance. Studies concentrated near large cities resulting in extensive
   unexplored sites in central Pantanal, in Paraguay, and in Bolivia.
   Unexpectedly, the most studied species were conducted with dry-fruited,
   terrestrial forbs, or shrubs with autochoric or zoochoric dispersal
   syndromes. Seed banks, stress tolerance, and dispersal were the most
   studied topics, whereas studies on dormancy and seedling establishment
   remain rare. We also found disproportionate research interest across the
   angiosperm tree of life with many examples of underrepresented and
   overrepresented families. Altogether, persistent knowledge gaps in
   seed-based research in the Pantanal hinder upscaling restoration
   programs and consequently the likelihood of achieving the targets of UN
   Decade of Ecosystem Restoration. We propose an integrated agenda
   consisting of a series of orchestrated actions to overcome such
   barriers, close biodiversity knowledge shortfalls, and promote
   successful large-scale restoration programs in the Pantanal.},

Title = {Arthropod Facilitation by Wood-Boring Beetles: Spatio-temporal
   Distribution Mediated by a Twig-girdler Ecosystem Engineer},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INSECT SCIENCE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {18},
Number = {5},
Month = {OCT 15},
Abstract = {The twig-girdler beetle Oncideres albomarginata chamela (Chemsak and
   Giesbert) (Cerambycidae: Lamiinae) detaches branches of Spondias
   purpurea L. (Sapindales: Anacardiaceae) that fall on the forest floor or
   remain suspended on vegetation. Many wood-boring beetles also oviposit
   in these branches and larval development creates cavities that are
   abandoned when the adults emerge. The objective of this study was to
   evaluate the role of wood-boring beetles as facilitators by creating new
   habitats for arthropods, and test for vertical stratification and
   temporal variation of arthropods associated with S. purpurea branches
   that were previously engineered by O. albomarginata chamela in a
   tropical dry forest (TDF) in Jalisco, Mexico. In order to determine the
   effects of vertical strata and seasons on branch colonization by
   arthropods, we placed 60 branches on the forest floor (ground stratum)
   and 60 were placed in trees (vegetation stratum) from February to April
   (dry season), and from August to October 2016 (rainy season), for 240
   branch samples in total. We collected 8,008 arthropods, which included
   7,753 ants (14 species) and 255 nonsocial arthropods (80 species) from
   13 different orders. We observed a greater arthropod abundance in the
   branches in the vegetation stratum in the dry season compared with the
   rainy season, whereas the richness and abundance of arthropods in the
   ground stratum were greater in the rainy season compared with the dry
   season. We concluded that wood-boring beetles are important habitat
   facilitators for arthropods, and that the vertical position of branches
   and the seasonal variations in TDFs differently affect the colonization
   of the abandoned cavities by arthropods.},

Abstract = {The sediments from the Coari lake, a ``terra firme{''} lake sculpted
   into Plio-Pleistocene deposits, and the Acara lake, a flooding-type lake
   developed on Quaternary sediments in the floodplain of the mid-Solimoes
   river, in the western Amazonia, Brazil, were studied to investigate the
   environmental condition of their developing. This study includes mineral
   composition, geochemistry, Pb isotope, palinology, radiocarbon-age and
   morphological framework of the lakes obtained from SRTM satellite
   images. The geological and the environmental conditions in the two lakes
   are highly variable and suggest that their evolution reflect autogenic
   processes under humid rainforest condition. Although kaolinite, quartz,
   muscovite, illite, and smectite are the main minerals in both lakes, the
   geochemistry indicates distinct source, the Acara lake sediments have
   higher concentrations of Al2O3, Fe2O3, FeO, CaO, K2O, MgO, Na2O, P2O5,
   Ba, V, Cu, Ni, Zn, Pb, Sr, Li, Y and La and have more radiogenic Pb than
   the Coari lake sediments. The radiocarbon ages suggest that at 10160 yr
   BP the Coari lake started to be developed due to avulsion of the
   Solimoes river, and the Acara lake was formed by the meander abandonment
   of Solimoes river retaining its grass dominated shore at ca. 3710 yr BP.},

Abstract = {The rapid expansion of human altered landscapes affects biodiversity on
   every continent. A fundamental goal of conservation biologists is to
   understand why certain species are at risk of extinction while others
   are able to persist in human altered landscapes. Afforestation, the
   conversion of unforested lands to planted forest, is rapidly altering
   many natural landscapes worldwide. In the Cerrado (Brazilian savanna), a
   global biodiversity hotspot, a shortage of government incentives has the
   landscape riddled with abandoned plantation forests that are not subject
   to active restoration projects. Studies investigating the impacts of
   abandoned plantations on biodiversity are strikingly limited. We examine
   the effects of abandoned Eucalyptus plantations on the structure of
   Cerrado lizard communities. We assessed changes in lizard capture,
   richness and equitability along cerrado sensu stricto-Eucalyptus
   transects. Our results indicate abandoned Eucalyptus plantations have
   subsets of Cerrado species persisting with a great loss of endemic
   species. The cerrado sensu stricto-Eucalyptus linear transect analysis
   demonstrated distance from native habitat is positively correlated with
   loss of biodiversity. We performed correspondence analyses to summarize
   the variation in species captures across different sites, habitats and
   pitfall array positions. These analyses depicted strong species
   associations between habitats and their pitfall array positions. This
   study is the first to show the negative impacts of abandoned Eucalyptus
   plantations on Cerrado lizard communities, serving as a cautionary tale
   of Cerrado biodiversity non-resilience in abandoned Eucalyptus
   plantations. Mitigation requires that abandoned Eucalyptus plantations
   are made more suitable to Cerrado lizards by implementing targeted
   habitat heterogeneity restoration.},

Abstract = {Artisanal mining is intensely carried out in developing countries,
   including Brazil and especially in the Amazon. This method of mineral
   exploration generally does not employ mitigation techniques for
   potential damages and can lead to various environmental problems and
   risks to human health. The objectives of this study were to quantify the
   concentrations of rare earth elements (REEs) and estimate the
   environmental and human health risks in cassiterite and monazite
   artisanal mining areas in the southeastern Amazon, as well as to
   understand the dynamics of this risk over time after exploitation. A
   total of 35 samples of wastes classified as overburden and tailings in
   active areas, as well as in areas deactivated for one and ten years were
   collected. Samples were also collected in a forest area considered as a
   reference site. The concentrations of REEs were quantified using
   alkaline fusion and ICP-MS. The results were used to calculate pollution
   indices and environmental and human health risks. REEs showed higher
   concentrations in anthropized areas. Pollution and environmental risk
   levels were higher in areas deactivated for one year, with considerable
   contamination factors for Gd and Sm and significant to extreme
   enrichment factors for Sc. Human health risks were low (< 1) in all
   studied areas. The results indicate that artisanal mining of cassiterite
   and monazite has the potential to promote contamination and enrichment
   by REEs.},

   behavior of two spider species under influence of the penultimate instar
   larvae of E. unilabiana. The cocoon webs built by parasitized Eurymorion
   sp. are structurally similar to those of Sphecozone sp. induced by the
   same parasitoid species. The areas of the sheets and the length of the
   interception threads of the cocoon webs were significantly smaller than
   those of normal webs. Several individuals of the two species of host
   spiders are induced to abandon their normal webs to build a cocoon web

Journal = {NATURE CONSERVATION RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {7},

Abstract = {The introduction of nurse species on degraded sites of Permanently
   Protected Areas represents a useful strategy for vegetation recovery in
   riparian forest. Species of the genus Baccharis (Asteraceae) have been
   documented as potential nurse plants being able of restructuring the
   native plant community. This study was aimed to evaluate the potential
   nursing role of Baccharis dracunculifolia in the recovery of a native
   plant community of a degraded Atlantic rainforest in a short-time
   period. The study was developed in two abandoned pasture areas in a
   riparian forest in the River Piranga basin, one in which B.
   dracunculifolia was planted (Restored treatment) to promote restoration,
   and a second area with no intervention (Degraded = Control treatment).
   Sampling took place 18 months after the planting of B. dracunculifolia.
   We set up 20 plots of 2 x 2 m in each treatment type (n = 40 plots),
   where all plant species were recorded (with the exception of the
   introduced Baccharis individuals and grasses), classifying them as
   native, ruderal, or alien. Plant richness was twice higher in the
   Restored treatment than the Degraded treatment. Furthermore, the
   observed values of alpha, gamma and beta diversity were also higher in
   Restored treatment. Restored treatment had 17 exclusive native species,
   while the Degraded treatment had only three non-exclusive native
   species. In addition, fewer ruderal and alien species were recorded in
   the restored plots with B. dracunculifolia compared to degraded plots.
   We concluded that, even in a short time period, planting B.
   dracunculifolia had a positive effect on promoting the assembly of the
   native plant community and possibly decreasing the chances of invasion
   by alien species.},

Abstract = {{[}1] We describe spatiotemporal variation in land cover over 80,000 km
   2 in central Rondonia. We use a multistage process to map primary
   forest, pasture, second growth, urban, rock/savanna, and water using 33
   Landsat scenes acquired over three contiguous areas between 1975 and
   1999. Accuracy of the 1999 classified maps was assessed as exceeding
   85\% based on digital airborne videography. Rondonia is highly
   fragmented, in which forests outside of restricted areas consist of
   numerous, small irregular patches. Pastures in Rondonia persist over
   many years and are not typically abandoned to second growth, which when
   present rarely remains unchanged longer than 8 years. Within the state,
   annual deforestation rates, pasture area, and ratio of second growth to
   cleared area varied spatially. Highest initial deforestation rates
   occurred in the southeast (Luiza), at over 2\%, increasing to 3\% by the
   late 1990s. In this area, the percentage of cleared land in second
   growth averaged 18\% and few pastures were abandoned. In central
   Rondonia (Ji-Parana), deforestation rates rose from 1.2\% between 1978
   and 1986 to a high of 4.2\% in 1999. In the northwest (Ariquemes),
   initial deforestation rates were lowest at 0.5\% but rose substantially
   in the late 1990s, peaking at 3\% in 1998. The ratio of second growth to
   cleared area was more than double the ratio in Luiza and few pastures
   remained unchanged beyond 8 years. Land clearing was most intense close
   to the major highway, BR364, except in Ariquemes. Intense forest
   clearing extended at least 50 km along the margins of BR364 in Ji-Parana
   and Luiza. Spatial differences in land use are hypothesized to result
   from a combination of economic factors and soil fertility.},

   Informal Green Spaces: Lessons from Central European City},
Journal = {LAND},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {13},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Urban informal green spaces (IGS) represent valuable reservoirs of
   biodiversity within urban areas and are increasingly recognized as
   integral components of green infrastructure. They are perceived as
   temporary ecosystems, and the management of their vegetation is
   relatively understudied. The development time of spontaneous vegetation
   on transformed lands is considered to be in the range of decades, which
   makes it even more necessary to provide managers with better guidelines
   for such a long period. Two suggested management approaches for these
   areas involve: (1) retaining vegetation at various stages of succession
   (non-forest IGS) and (2) protecting advanced developmental stages
   (forest IGS), with options for balanced intervention or complete
   non-intervention. However, the differences in biodiversity between these
   two types in cities across Central Europe remain unknown, as well as
   whether the predictors of biodiversity at both local and landscape
   scales are consistent for non-forest and forest IGS. We examined factors
   such as habitat continuity, landscape structure, soil quality, and human
   impact to shed light on pathways for enhancing urban floristic
   diversity. Conducting extensive botanical surveys in existing informal
   green spaces (IGS) in Warsaw, we derived various parameters, including
   the total number of species, Shannon-Wiener biodiversity index,
   hemeroby, urbanity, share of species from distinct ecological groups,
   and the number of rare and ancient forest plant species. Tracing habitat
   continuity from the early 20th century using digitized aerial imagery
   provided a unique long-term perspective on IGS development. We revealed
   that no management is pivotal for the conservation of select rare and
   ancient forest species. On the other hand, partial abandonment with
   occasional maintenance may enrich species diversity across different
   successional phases. We uncovered the significant influence of landscape
   structure and human activity on vegetation species composition within
   IGS. Notably, IGS proximate to extensive forest landscapes displayed a
   marked abundance of forest species, alongside a greater prevalence of
   rare species. However, the presence of other vegetation types in the
   vicinity did not yield similar effects. Our findings indicate that IGS,
   when left untouched for decades near forested areas, are valuable for
   urban biodiversity. As cities across the globe seek sustainable paths,
   this research underscores the importance of properly understanding and
   integrating IGS into urban ecological planning.},

Abstract = {Aquatic contamination by potentially toxic metals is a problem that has
   been aggravated, especially due to the quantity and the diversity of
   sources. Locating these sources is not always an easy task, especially
   because of the wide variety of possibilities. In this context, the
   application of geostatistical methods may represent an excellent tool to
   find out sources of metal contaminants in aquatic systems. Thus, the
   objective of this work was to elaborate an approach to identify sources
   of potentially toxic metals (Zn, Ba, Pb, Cr, Mn and Fe), by relating
   their spatial-temporal variations with the local land use patterns,
   along a longitudinal profile of the Pirapora River, located in the State
   of Sao Paulo, Brazil. For this purpose, water samples were collected at
   different points, taking into consideration each specific land use
   pattern and quantifying the metals contents by microwave plasma atomic
   emission spectrometry. In this work, thirteen land use patterns have
   been identified: mining, forestry, abandoned pasture, water, urban area,
   human occupation, floodplain, bare soil, temporary crop, roads, forest,
   streets and pasture. The results revealed temporal variations for the
   metals Ba, Cr, Fe, and Pb and spatial for Zn and Mn, making possible to
   correlate the presence of these two latter metals with mining and
   forestry, the most proeminent activities in the region. Overall, this
   work proposes a model which brings together geoprocessing and analytical
   methods, in order to correlate spatial-temporal variations of
   potentially toxic metals with specific land use patterns of a determined
   region, aiming the environmental monitoring.},

   observed in each plot. A total of 675 individuals, with 201 recorded in
   the first sampling and 474 in the second, were recorded. In total, 24
   species and 11 families were identified, and a group of six was
   indeterminate, where four species were found in the first sampling and
   two species in the second sampling. Families with superior wealth in
   relation to the total were Asteraceae (26.92 \%) and Melastomataceae
   (15.38 \%); however, the families that had a higher number of
   individuals in the sample were Poaceae and Verbenaceae, with 33.33 \%

   Portulacaceae and Verbenaceae, with 93.03 \%, 68.16 \% and 35.82 \%,
   respectively. Among the habits found, herbaceous was highlighted, with
   65.63 \% of the sampled individuals, followed by 6.22 \% for shrubs,
   5.48 \% for subshrubs and 1.18 \% for trees. The sterile substrate stack
   does not have to establish favorable conditions for vegetation because

Abstract = {In northeastern Para, smallholder agriculture systems are still based on
   secondary forest fallows, nationally called ``capoeira{''}, presumed to
   contain a remarkable amount of underutilized valuable woody species, for
   instance as supplementary forage for cattle. We tested five promising
   capoeira species, namely Phenakospermum guyannense, Cecropia palmata,
   Attalea maripa, Inga edulis, and Abarema jupunba by comparing its
   relative palatability-i.e., the palatability differences between the
   tested species and the reference forage legumes, forage grass, and
   between the other tested species-, heights, biomass production, and main
   nutritive values with the well-known tropical forage legumes Cratylia
   argentea and Flemingia macrophylla. Additionally, the locally common
   domesticated species Tithonia diversifolia, Mangifera indica, and
   Racosperma mangium were also included in the trial, all implemented in a
   randomized block design on a Brachiaria-pasture (n = 2000 saplings, 8
   replication blocks). After two years of establishment, four steers with
   an average body mass of 506 kg browsed the trial (2 AU/ha). The relative
   palatability testing showed that A. jupunba, M. indica and also
   surprisingly R. mangium (all >20\% of its respective total biomass)
   matched the consumed biomass of F. macrophylla, while C. palmata (>60\%)
   even surpassed very palatable C. argentea. R. mangium also had the
   highest biomass production, while the other species showed just regular
   growth and establishing rates. Protein contents of all species were
   above 6\%, most of them higher than 10\% and in the case of T.
   diversifolia even above 20\%. Thus, all tested species almost reached
   the quality of the reference legumes. However, as plant secondary
   compounds were not regarded in this trial, recommendations as
   supplementary forage plants can only be given with reservations. The
   results suggest that smallholders possess cheap forage supplement
   alternatives on their farms and even on their pasture plots, which
   simply have to be tolerated by just pruning them into accessible heights
   for animals. However, sapling transplantation from shady capoeiras on
   old slightly degraded pastures for biomass enrichment cannot be
   recommended. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Journal = {APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {133},
Pages = {160-165},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The time interval in which a community plant recovers after a
   disturbance is strongly associated with the availability of nutrients
   and soil organic matter, factors that are widely known as limiting for
   the establishment of pioneer species. The nest refuse (NR) produced by
   leaf cutting ants may act to favour herbaceous regeneration in newly
   disturbed areas, but little is known about its effects in this process.
   In the present study, we experimentally verified the effect of NR on
   plant regeneration in a newly deforested area, testing the hypothesis
   that plots with NR act as hot spots for plant establishment, promoting
   greater aboveground biomass and altering the vegetation structure in
   comparison to control sites. Thirty plots of 30 x 30 cm were installed,
   where half of the plots received a layer of 3 cm of soil from the same
   site (control) while the other plots received a layer of 3 cm of a
   mixture of control soil + NR, in a 3:1 ratio (25\% organic refuse).
   After 150 days of natural regeneration, we evaluated the diversity of
   herbaceous species that colonised each plot and the aboveground dry
   biomass. The species composition differed between treatments and the
   aboveground biomass was 45\% higher in the plots with NR than control
   soil. In this way, refuse dumps can act as regeneration sites, favouring
   pioneer species in newly deforested areas.},

   Conservation: a Review},
Journal = {NATUREZA \& CONSERVACAO},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {11},
Number = {2},
Pages = {108+},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {There is good evidence that the results of a restoration program depend
   largely on the landscape context such as habitat cover, connectivity and
   isolation. Such evidence, however, is not coherently presented in the
   scientific literature. This review aims to provide an overview of how
   landscape ecology has been used in restoration projects in the last 15
   years. We found only 54 empirical restoration studies published in
   international journals from 1997 to 2011 that used a landscape approach,
   mostly published between 2009 and 2011. The majority of the studies were
   carried out in temperate zones and forests, with habitat loss and
   fragmentation as the major disturbance factor (77\%). Biotic
   manipulation was the most common management protocol (39\%), followed by
   abiotic manipulation, land abandonment, and control of disturbance
   sources. Most of the studies (84\%) demonstrate that the landscape
   context plays an important role in restoration processes. Particularly,
   a positive influence of the landscape context on restoration
   effectiveness was observed for restored areas in close proximity to
   neighboring patches and in landscapes with high habitat cover. However,
   we found that the effect of landscape characteristics on restoration
   outcomes may vary with species characteristics, and differ according to
   the population or community parameters (e.g. abundance, richness,
   composition) considered. In addition, different landscape aspects
   mediated the effects of restoration on biological communities, and thus
   there is not a unique set of landscape indices that can be universally
   used for restoration planning and monitoring. Although the literature
   has important gaps, since most studies are restricted to few habitat and
   disturbance types and consider only a limited set of landscape
   attributes, our findings demonstrate that landscape characteristics can
   be as important as local factors in influencing restoration outcomes and
   should be incorporated in restoration projects and programmes. By
   considering a wide range of landscape resilience and disturbance
   condition since the beginning of future restoration plans, we expect
   that the main gaps of knowledge identified here can be filled in the
   near future, helping then to reveal a more general pattern relating
   landscape structure to restoration outcomes.},

Abstract = {Because of some catastrophic events which occurred in Mexico during the
   1980 decade, the utilization of ``tepescohuite{''} bark against skin
   wounds and burns was popularized. The media manipulated the lack of
   available information about its medical properties and gave erroneous
   information to the society propagating a lot of myths. Therefore, the
   aim of this paper is to determine its taxonomic identity and to study
   the distribution, bark and wood anatomy of this species, and to
   determine its actual and historic uses, and the compilation of the
   information about bark pharmacology and toxicity. Its taxonomic identity
   is established as Mimosa tenuiflora (Willd.) Poir.
   (Fabaceae-Mimosoideae). It blooms and fructifies from November to June,
   occurring in Mexico (the states of Oaxaca and Chiapas), Guatemala,
   Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Panama, Colombia, Venezuela and
   Brazil. at altitudes of 0-1110 (-1520) m. In Mexico, it is found in dry
   forests, thorny thickets, Pinus and Pinus-Qeurcus forests, and in M,
   tenuiflora pure thickets, along roads and in resting or abandoned
   culture lands. This species has an aggregate distribution in the forests
   and a uniform one in the thickets. It presents a mean density of 9
   individuals per m(2), with 0.45 of frequency per quadrat and 1.69 m(2)
   of mean coverture, and it has a wide range of tolerance to climatic and
   edaphic factors. confirming their invasive character. Regionally, the

Abstract = {Dispersal limitation severely impairs the trajectory of restoration,
   mainly due to the lack of seed vectors bringing seeds from nearby
   habitats; a role played by many frugivorous vertebrates that can be
   absent or reduced in restored or degraded sites. Here we propose a new
   technique named Induced Seed Dispersal, that amplifies the role that
   many generalist frugivores have in seed dispersal. It consists in the
   offering of seeds embedded in the pulp of commercial fruits or whole
   native fleshy fruits in feeders to generalist frugivores, which ingest
   the seeds and defecate them elsewhere. We set feeders in a restored site
   and monitored the visiting pattern of these frugivores with
   cameras-traps. We also set seed traps to retrieve seeds dispersed by
   frugivores and offered around 1,500 seeds ofCecropia
   hololeuca(Urticaceae) per week for 1 year. We recorded at least 24
   generalist frugivore species of terrestrial mammals, bats and birds,
   which ingested/removed the seeds/fruits from the feeders. Seeds ofC.
   hololeucadispersed by marmosets were retrieved in the seed traps and
   germinated. We estimated a potential seed rain of more than 600C.
   hololeucaseeds ha(-1) mo(-1). Synthesis and applications. Our study
   demonstrates that this new technique can make use of generalist
   frugivores to assist restoration or regeneration into sites where seed
   dispersal is compromised by the lack of dispersers or limited seed
   arrival. Inducing seed dispersal by generalist frugivores is a low-cost
   and easy-managed technique that can be applied year-round in restoration
   and forest enrichments at all scales.},

   meta-analysis},
Journal = {ACTA OECOLOGICA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {118},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Anthropogenic changes in natural landscapes are identified as a major
   driver of biodiversity loss worldwide. Consequently, important ecosystem
   functions, such as seed dispersal by animals, can be lost, which
   threaten the stability of essential ecological processes. Given the
   current scenario of large seed disperser's loss, secondary dispersal by
   ants has been identified as an important alternative to mitigate the
   impacts caused by human changes. However, empirical evidence shows
   contradictory effects of anthropogenic disturbances on diaspore removal
   by ants. Here, we conducted a global meta-analysis from 22 studies (65
   comparisons) comparing dia-spore removal by ants in disturbed versus
   preserved areas to investigate general trends to different anthropogenic
   disturbances. Specifically, we evaluate: (i) the effects of
   anthropogenic disturbances on diaspore removal by ants comparing
   temperate and tropical regions, and (ii) comparing different disturbance
   types (agriculture related disturbances, fragmentation, mining, fire,
   etc.) on diaspore removal by ants. We found an overall negative effect
   of anthropogenic disturbances on diaspore removal by ants (26\%
   decrease), both in temperate and tropical regions (38\% and 19\%
   decrease, respectively). In addition, diaspore removal by ants responded
   negatively to disturbances related to fragmentation (24\% decrease) and
   mining (83\% decrease). However, we found no evi-dence of effects in
   areas subjected to agricultural processes (0.9\% decrease). Our findings
   suggest that human disturbances might compromise crucial early stages to
   the natural regeneration in ecosystems such the seed dispersal.},

Abstract = {Todos os Santos (all Saints) Bay area on Brazil's east coast is known
   for one of the most significant cases of lead contamination in the
   country owing to the past activities of a Pb-smelter plant. This work
   was carried out to assess the concentration and sources of Pb based on
   Pb isotopes and enrichment factor of soil profiles surrounding Todos os
   Santos Bay in order to understand the expansion of contamination and to
   help the establishment of Pb regulatory standards for the region.
   Forty-four samples were collected from soil genetic horizons of six
   pedons that represent the range of dominant soil properties and geologic
   materials in the region. Concentrations of Pb and the isotopes Pb-204,
   Pb-206, Pb-207, and Pb-208 were determined on an inductively coupled
   plasma (quadrupole) mass spectrometry. The soil enrichment factor was
   calculated using Al and Fe as conservative index elements. Average Pb
   concentration (15.87 mg kg(-1)) in uppermost horizons (from all six
   pedons) is slightly higher than soil background concentrations commonly
   reported in Brazil. Samples feature a wide range of Pb isotope ratios,
   ranging from 36.71 to 47.38 for Pb-208/Pb-204, 15.00 to 15.65 for
   Pb-207/Pb-204, 16.86 to 20.59 for Pb-206/Pb-204, and 1.10 to 1.31 for
   Pb-206/Pb-207. For the enrichment factor calculations, only Fe
   demonstrated a good agreement with Pb isotopic ratios. Both Pb isotopic
   composition and enrichment factor were useful tools to distinguishing
   natural and anthropogenic influence on the Pb soil concentrations.},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Along the Amazonian pioneer front in the Brazilian state of Pari,
   smallholder farmers manually clear primary rain forest every year to
   grow rice prior to sowing pastures that they will use for 5-20 years.
   Species richness and floristic composition of the weedy species were
   studied in 20 plots along a farming succession, from rice fields, to
   1-year-old, 4-8-year-old and over 10-year-old pastures planted to
   Brachiaria brizantha. In the early phases of the farming cycle reduction
   in the average plant total species richness in 50 m 2 plots decreased
   from 67 to 20 species and comprised both woody and herbaceous species.
   The increase to 41 species further observed in mature pastures was
   essentially comprised of herbaceous species. Rice fields were
   characterised by a great floristic heterogeneity which later decreased
   when they were planted to pastures. PCA of plant communities ordinated
   plots along a gradient of increasing anthropisation that explained
   23.6\% of total variance. Species were classified into four ecological
   groups, which floristic composition and specific richness changed
   throughout the farming succession. Species richness and density of
   forest woody species decreased progressively from 32 to 7 species and
   from 152 to 16 2 individuals per 50 in, and only a few species such as
   Memora allanmandiflora and Poecilanthe effusa resisted pasture
   conditions. Pioneer/ secondary woody species of the genera Cecropia and
   Solanum germinated out of the forest seed bank, and seven species on
   average were observed in rice fields and 1-year-old pastures. At later
   stages (>4 years) their respective species richness decreased to three
   species while their density decreased sharply, from 439 to 41
   individuals per 50 m(2). A few forest herbaceous species of the families
   Marantaceae and Poaceae and the fern species Adiantum argutum, which
   survived in rice fields (2 species per 50 in 2 on average), almost
   disappeared in the 4-8-year-old pastures. In the early phase of the
   intra-farming succession, a rather stable community of six species of
   secondary herbaceous plants on average was established. Species richness
   further increased to 16 in the > 10-year-old pastures with addition of
   species such as Desmodium axillare, Phyllanthus amarus or Cyperus
   compressus. In accordance with the concept of Initial Floristic
   Composition, floristic composition at the beginning of the intra-farming
   succession was determined by the floristic composition of the former
   forest and by the nature and intensity of the initial disturbance
   (deforestation and burning). Further changes in species richness,
   floristic composition and density in the intrafarming succession are
   driven by the intra-farming management. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {Chlordecone (CLD), used to control the Cosmopolites sordidus banana
   weevil and released from polluted banana plantations, continues to
   contaminate ecosystems in the French Caribbean. Edible plants have been
   actively studied for risk prevention, but trees have not, even though
   they could play a significant role in future remediation strategies. CLD
   contents were analysed in 24 pioneer trees belonging to 13 species found
   in abandoned banana plantations in Guadeloupe, at three contaminated
   sites on Nitisols (Site 1) and Andosols (Sites 2 and 3). Samples were
   taken from each tree: wood in the basal part of the trunk and soil at
   its foot and their CLD content was measured by the analytical laboratory
   for the Dr??me d??partement (26) in Valence, France. Mean CLD contents
   in the top 30 -centimetre soil layer from sites 1, 2 and 3 were 2,543 ??
   702, 5,251 ?? 1,102 and 875 ?? 865 pg/kg dry soil respectively. Of the
   trees, 96\% were contaminated. The CLD content in trees growing on
   Nitisols (3,406 ?? 1,658 pg/kg dry wood) was at least 5 times higher
   than in trees growing on Andosols (299 ?? 314 and 226 ?? 378 pg/kg), but
   no clear relationships were found with soil CLD contents. Calculations
   of available CLD dissolved in the soil liquid phase using equations and
   soil datasets in the literature showed higher available CLD contents in
   Nitisols than in Andosols and a linear relationship between CLD
   available in soil and concentrations of CLD in wood, regardless of the
   type of soil. Trees growing on Nitisols are the plants most highly
   contaminated by CLD of all the plants in which this compound has been
   studied so far. With a plant-to-soil bioconcentration ratio around 150
   l/kg, the consistent CLD uptake efficiency of the trees needs to be
   taken into account in further research for CLD remediation.},

Abstract = {Charcoal evidence suggests that fires in Amazonian forests were an
   infrequent agent of forest disturbance prior to the twentieth century.
   However, the spatial and temporal distribution of fires changed
   dramatically during the past few decades. Fire has become one of the
   driving forces of land use and land cover change in Amazonia. Increasing
   human intervention in the region, in conjunction with climate anomalies,
   has exposed tropical forests to an unprecedented amount of vegetation
   fires with important consequences to the functioning of the complex
   Amazonian system and atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases. In
   this chapter, the main fire types in Amazonia are discussed:
   deforestation, maintenance, accidental, and natural fires. The major
   causes and consequences of vegetation fires are analyzed in light of
   their social, economic, and biophysical drivers. Satellite data are used
   to derive current maps describing the spatial and temporal distribution
   of fires in the region, highlighting some of the important linkages
   between human activities and climate conditions that combine to create
   unique anthropogenic fire regimes across Amazonia.},

Journal = {CADERNOS DE GEOGRAFIA},
Year = {2023},

Pages = {21-34},
Abstract = {Portugal is one of the Southern European countries most affected by
   forest fires, with recurrent events and frequent impacts. The
   demographic and social changes that have occurred in rural areas have
   driven land abandonment in recent years, which, in turn, influences
   forest management and wildland-urban interface (WUI) areas that are
   related to fires. The aim of this work is to develop a case study in the
   municipality of Baiao based on the large wildfire (LWF) of 2019, by
   defining and mapping the WUI areas, evaluating the LWF recurrence and
   severity, and the vegetation regrowth in a period of 2 years in areas
   with different land uses affected by distinct fire severities. The study
   was organized into 4 stages: firstly, we mapped the fire occurrences and
   then the WUI areas. After fire mapping, the recurrence of wildfires was
   characterized and the last step corresponded to the evaluation of the
   severity of the LWF of 2019 and the evaluation of the vegetation
   regeneration, and different land use types. The WUI represents 26.7\% of
   the territory of the municipality of Baiao. From 2001 to 2021, the
   municipality registered 3,770 fire occurrences. In 2019, the LWF of
   Baiao burned an area corresponding to 853 ha, which was affected by a
   total of 12 fires in the period between 1975 and 2019, resulting in a
   maximum degree of 11 recurrences for the same area. With regard to the
   direct impact of fire on vegetation and its subsequent recovery, we can
   see that 2 years after the LWF, the area occupied by the forest and
   shrub vegetation, which were hit by high severity, already showed
   significant levels of vegetation regrowth. As a main conclusion, the
   study contributes to widen the understanding of the patterns created by
   fire in different landscapes, and this information is valuable for
   forest managers to know the consequences (beneficial or not) and be able
   to plan prevention, restoration, and environmental education actions.},

Abstract = {Environmental monitoring of small, rural watersheds was one of the
   components of the Natural Resources Management and Rural Poverty
   Alleviation Program (RS-Rural) in southern Brazil. The purpose of the
   monitoring was to assess the impact of promoting soil conservation and
   environment management practices adopted by farmers and funded by the
   Program. In four small monitored watersheds, in a total of 95 plots
   representing distinct land use and soil management, surface soil was
   collected to characterize ground-zero of the Program by determining
   several soil physical, chemical and microbiological properties.
   Principal component analysis (PCA) shows soil physical, chemical and
   biological properties were decisive in defining the agricultural soils
   in the rural watersheds with family farming. The sensitivity to chemical
   properties provides an opportunity to improve soil quality if soil
   management focuses on altering those properties. Soil management
   practiced by tobacco farmers leads to rapid, intense degradation of some
   natural soil properties, especially those related to the dynamics of
   soil organic matter, compared with more conservationist uses (forest,
   regrowth, and grassland). Thus, soil management must be reoriented to
   avoid the progress of degradation and recover soil physical and
   biological quality. Cover crops and by land-abandonment to allow natural
   vegetation are important management strategies for the degraded soils
   used for tobacco production, increasing soil organic matter, nutrients
   and microbial activity and thus allowing further crop production. In
   conclusion, watersheds with tobacco cropping have soils with lower
   quality than when under no-tillage grain production, requiring changes
   in land use and soil management. (C) 2021 International Research and

Abstract = {(1) Soil nutrient was studied in relation to vegetation development on
   thirteen abandoned pastures differing in age from two to eight years and
   intensity of pasture use from light to heavy. The surface soils of these
   sites had higher cation concentration and pH than those of undisturbed
   mature forest of the area, but similar phosphorus, organic matter and
   total nitrogen concentrations. (2)Soil nutrient concentration generally
   was independent of age or prior intensity of use in the pastures.
   Pasture use has a significant effect on soil nutrient concentration when
   the sites are first abandoned, but this does not persist. Nutrient
   uptake by successional vegetation may substantially reduce soil reduce
   soil nutrient stocks. (3) Soil nutrient concentration was not
   significantly correlated with vegetation biomass, primary tree biomass
   or species richness, either among or within sites. (4) Nutrient
   depletion of pastures abandoned eight years previously relative to total
   nutrient stocks in  mature forest depended on pasture disturbance. Sites
   previously subjected to low use were only depleted of N, moderate-use
   sites sites were depleted of N and K, and heavy-use sites were depleted
   of N, K, Mg and possibly Ca and P. There was less nutrient depletion
   than the relatively small biomass of the successional sites would
   indicate. This was due to a higher proportion of nutrient-rich leaves
   and fine branches, enriched soil nutrient stocks relative to mature
   forest and, on the lightly disturbed sites, a large pool of nutrients in
   unburned woody residue. (5) Decomposition of unburned woody residue may
   provide one-half of the nutrients taken up by vegetation during eight
   years of recovery following light pasture use, but only 15\% following
   moderate use, and none following the most intense use. (6) General
   schemes of successing following deforestation for pasture development
   are presented. Recovery after disturbance is complex, and follows
   different patterns depending on the  intensity of pasture use.},

Abstract = {We assess the relation between the contrasting vegetation types of

   on Marajo Island at the mouth of the Amazon River. Floristic and carbon
   isotopic characterizations of modern plants were combined with organic
   matter carbon isotope and grain size records of soil to characterize
   vegetation evolution at six locations on southeastern and northeastern
   Marajo Island and its relations to climate changes since the late
   Pleistocene. C-3 plants contribute 100\% of the biomass in the
   rainforest on post-Barreiras sediments (site 1). No significant
   vegetation changes are evident in these places since at least similar to
   7860 cal yr B.P. Rainforests on paleochannels (sites 4 and 6) are
   protected from flooding by slightly elevated sandy levee and have flora
   very similar to site 1. These forests were formed since the early-mid
   Holocene after channel abandonment C3 grasses are predominant in open
   savanna areas (sites 4,5 and 6), with less representation in wooded
   savannas (sites 2 and 3). However, C-4 grasses, despite having fewer
   species, constitute significant biomass in the wooded (similar to 60\%)
   and open savanna vegetation areas, especially during the dry season. The
   reconstructions of past vegetation together with the distributions of
   modern vegetation allow prediction that climate changes to drier
   conditions can significantly influence the future Marajo Island
   landscape, likely enabling expansion of C-4 plants in the flooding zone
   and of trees in the rainforests. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {Tropical non-self-supporting plants such as hemiepiphytes and nomadic
   vines are model organisms for disentangling biotic and environmental
   correlates which influence their occupancy patterns. We inventoried
   >4000 individuals from >3000 trees ranging from 1 to 200 cm diameter at
   breast height (DBH) in a northeastern Amazonian upland forest to address
   how tree (phorophyte) size, edaphic factors and recruitment strategy
   influence occupancy, diversity, and compositional patterns of two
   vascular non-self-supporting plant functional groups. Hemiepiphytes
   germinate on phorophytes prior to establishing soil connections, whereas
   nomadic vines initiate their life cycle on the forest floor and
   subsequently climb phorophytes for crown access, abandoning roots
   replaced by adventitious connections which may reach the ground. Our
   results show that larger phorophytes (>= 30 cm DBH) supported more
   species for both hemiepiphytes and nomadic vines. However, nomadic
   vines' occupancy probabilities saturated faster at smaller stem sizes
   than that of hemiepiphytes indicating differential preferences for stem
   sizes among the two functional groups. For smaller phorophytes (<30 cm
   DBH), soil correlations were stronger with nomadic vines than
   hemiepiphytes, whereas no significant differences were detected among
   functional groups in relation to edaphic factors for larger (>= 30 cm
   DBH) ones. Finally, a small core group of species showed
   disproportionately greater abundances among large phorophytes suggesting
   that autogenic processes differentially promote survivability. Such
   interactions among phorophyte size and edaphic factors may result from
   the contrasting ecological requirements of hemiepiphytes and nomadic
   vines at the recruitment stage, demonstrating the necessity for
   elaborate demographic-based studies to better understand these complex
   plant-plant interactions.Abstract in Spanish is available with online

Volume = {71},

Abstract = {Copaifera multijuga Hayne is an Amazonian species that has been the
   target of intense exploitation due to its oleoresin. This raw material
   has a high value in various economic segments such as perfumery and
   cosmetics. However, there are few investigations aimed at characterizing
   the genetic parameters in native populations of this species. In this
   sense, our objective was to estimate the genetic diversity and
   characterize the mating system of C. multijuga found in a native
   population in the Western Amazon. Wood samples were collected from 48
   adult trees for the population study. Among these, 15 trees were
   selected to compose the group of maternal parents of the reproductive
   system study, for which leaf samples were collected from 20
   open-pollinated seedlings (offspring), which were obtained using natural
   regeneration (n = 300). Using five pairs of heterologous microsatellite
   primers, the main parameters of genetic diversity and mating system were
   estimated: observed (H-o) and expected (H-e) heterozygosity, total
   number of alleles (A), fixation index (f), multilocus (t(m)) and
   single-locus (t(s)) outcrossing rates, etc. The population showed levels
   of genetic diversity greater than 0.6 both in the adult trees (H-o:
   0.742; H-e: 0.743) and in the offspring (H-o: 0.685; H-e: 0.685). Mating
   occurred predominantly by outcrossing (t(m): 0.88-1.00), of which 4.1\%
   corresponded to mating between relatives (t(m)-t(s)). The results
   obtained in this study are fundamental for the investigation of the
   possible impacts of exploitation on the genetic diversity of native
   populations and, consequently, so that conservation strategies are
   properly planned.},

Abstract = {In this study we compared the values generated by traditional economic
   analysis (Net Present Value - NPV) with Real Options Method. The
   objective was to apply the method proposed by Copeland \& Antikarov for
   rainbow options, due to three stochastic variables selected with
   decision of abandonment if the project value with flexibility was less
   than the value of the underlying stock. It enabled the flexibility value
   generation in order to entrepreneurs to have more confidence in their
   decision when they are investing in a project with Agroforestry System,
   with different scenarios visualization in a single analysis. The results
   evidenced that the economic viability analysis, using Real Options,
   provided the best view of the possible scenarios, within a range
   generated by the prices volatility. The Net Present Value adopted as the
   underlying stock value was R\$ 5,684.32, using the discount rate (WACC)
   of 9.95\% and risk-free interest rate of 7.5\%. To determine the
   volatility were calculated: the logarithmic return standard deviation
   (27.06), the average (0.0883), upward movements values (u) (1.3107) with
   61.34\% of probability and downward movements values (d)(0.7628) with
   38.66\% of probability. The option value in case of abandonment was R\$
   2,059.01/ha positive. The results showed that the NPV overestimated the
   project return and that it would be viable to abandon it.},

Journal = {FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {1995},
Volume = {9},

Pages = {213-221},

Abstract = {1. Disturbed habitats in Amazonia, like active pastures and abandoned
   agricultural areas, are characterized by significant diurnal and
   seasonal drought stress that may restrict successful colonization by
   many plant taxa. Some species, however, show a remarkable capacity to
   withstand these water-limited conditions. We investigated, under
   controlled conditions, the bulk tissue-water relations and the
   gas-exchange characteristics in response to soil moisture stress of
   Solanum crinitum Lam. and Vismia guianensis (Aubl.) Choisy, two
   co-occurring gap-invading small trees known to dominate, disturbed,
   drought-prone habitats in the eastern Brazilian Amazon region.
   2. Bulk tissue-water relations of these two species were very different.
   Vismia guianensis had significantly higher bulk tissue elastic modulus
   (more rigid tissues) and lower bulk tissue osmotic potential at full
   hydration and at turgor loss than S. crinitum.
   3. The elastic and osmotic properties could either enhance turgor
   maintenance or increase the ability of a plant to extract soil water. In
   turn, this may help explain their ability to succeed in drought-prone
   habitats. With more elastic tissue properties, S. crinitum is able to
   maintain turgor and thus leaf gas exchange over greater changes in
   tissue water content, whereas having relatively more rigid tissues would
   aid V. guianensis in developing water potential gradients from the
   leaves to the soil with little tissue water loss, thus enhancing water
   uptake from drier soils.
   4. Photosynthetic capacity in S. crinitum was less affected by soil
   moisture stress than V. guianensis. Furthermore, because S. crinitum
   maintained stomatal conductance (g), but photosynthesis (A) declined
   under moisture stress, intrinsic water-use efficiency (A/g) actually
   dropped when water was limiting for this species. In contrast, V.
   guianensis maintained high A/g under both watering regimes and was
   always more water-use efficient than S. crinitum. Moreover, S. crinitum
   had two- to fourfold higher dark respiration than V. guianensis. We
   believe that it is this combination of traits that leads to lower growth
   in S. crinitum when compared to V. guianensis in the field.
   5. We suggest that the different gas-exchange responses and tissue water
   relations properties represent two different strategies for dealing with
   water deficits. Solanum crinitum, appears to be more able to cope with
   short-term water stress and is regarded to be a successful stress
   tolerator. In contrast, V. guianesis, appears to be able to cope better
   with chronic, long-term water stress, what we call a successful
   stress-avoider.},

Title = {Podzolisation preserves ichnofossils constructed by ghost shrimp},
Journal = {CATENA},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {180},
Pages = {110-119},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Ichnofossils of ghost shrimps (e.g., Ophiomorpha nodosa and Callichirus
   major) are interpreted worldwide as records of sea level fluctuations
   and provide reliable evidence of sedimentation rate, salinity, and
   substrate type. The preservation of these ichnofossils was previously
   ascribed to the polysaccharide mucus produced by ghost shrimps when
   burrows were built. We found evidence that these ichnofossils were
   preserved due to the impregnation of the burrow walls by dissolved
   organic matter (DOM) during podzolisation that took place after the
   galleries had been abandoned. Our study was conducted on a tropical
   barrier island in southeastern Brazil with a spatial gradient of
   podzolisation intensity. We made a detailed macromorphological
   description of the ichnofossils at the soil profile scale. Then, we used
   thin sections of undisturbed soils to identify sand grain arrangements
   and organic matter (OM) accumulation. We detected three
   macromorphological structures, (i) tubular gallery wall, (ii) sandy
   infilling of the gallery, and (iii) soil matrix outside the gallery. In
   the micromorphology analysis, we identified that the tubular wall is
   impregnated with monomorphic OM also found outside the burrow but in
   lower concentration. Sand grains in the wall of the gallery are tightly
   packed, causing a lower porosity than inside and outside the trace
   fossil. The precipitation of monomorphic OM is due to stagnation of DOM
   that percolated through the soil. Water with DOM is trapped in the wall
   of the tubule because of its smaller pores. The ghost shrimps
   constructed their burrows in marine sediments without podzolisation.
   Then, with the progradation of the shoreline, the sediments were
   colonized by resanga forest adding DOM to the soil and podzolisation
   started. The extent to which DOM is produced depends on vegetation
   development, therefore, the accumulation of DOM in the B horizon that
   enables the preservation of the ichnofossils is constrained by
   vegetation development and progradation of the shoreline.},

Abstract = {1. Current anthropogenic disturbances have changed natural environments,
   broadly impacting ecosystem services and functions. Here, the authors
   focused on the secondary dispersal of diaspores by ants, which serve an
   important ecological function in the natural regeneration of degraded
   habitats.2. The authors experimentally studied the effects of vegetation
   suppression and soil disturbance on (i) diaspore removal, (ii) the
   quality of secondary removal, and (iii) the structure of interaction
   networks between ants and diaspores. The authors tested whether the
   disturbance affected the species richness of seed removers, diaspore
   removal rate, removal distance and time, and removal effectiveness.
   Additionally, the authors tested whether the structure of ant-diaspore
   networks, that is, specialisation, modularity and robustness, is altered
   by soil disturbance. To do that, the authors studied three degraded and
   three preserved areas in the Brazilian Cerrado.3. The authors observed
   25 ant species interacting with the diaspores. Disturbance did not
   affect ant species richness, removal distance or removal rate, but ants
   took twice as long to remove the diaspores in the preserved habitat. The
   frequency of interaction networks was higher in the preserved habitat,
   and the effectiveness of species in removing the diaspores differed
   between habitats. Surprisingly, the authors observed that ants
   considered effective dispersers mostly occurred in degraded habitats,
   highlighting the potential of myrmecochory in the regeneration of
   impacted environments.4. The findings point to the potential of ants in
   acting as secondary seed dispersal, improving the restoration of areas
   highly impacted by soil disturbance. Moreover, this study contributes to
   understanding the effects of anthropogenic disturbances on ecological
   interactions and ecosystem functions.},

   National Park (Taman Nasional Bali Barat in Indonesian, hereafter TNBB)
   that was carried out in 2015. The survey also included other taxa and
   the motivation for it was to identify a species or group of species that
   could be used as indicators of management success for Protected Area
   Credits (PAC) under the Rainforest Standards (RFSTM) system. Four major
   ecosystems, moist forest, deciduous monsoon forest, savanna and an
   abandoned Teak plantation, were sampled over a period of 10 days, using
   belt transects and pitfall traps. We measured species richness,
   abundance and density, herpetofaunal diversity (Simpson's Index of
   Dominance and the Shannon Weiner Index) and community similarity. We
   also estimated the indicator value to determine which species, if any,
   might be suitable as indicators of environmental conditions. The survey
   yielded 30 species, 12 frogs and toads, 7 snakes and 11 lizards. Out of
   them there is an endangered gecko, Cyrtodactylus jatnai, a vulnerable
   frog, Microhyla orientalis, and a vulnerable tree-skink, Cryptoblepharus
   baliensis. Diversity was highest in the moist forest, followed closely
   by both the deciduous forest and the savanna. The greatest abundance was
   found in the savanna, followed by the moist forest and then the
   deciduous forest. Both diversity and abundance were extremely low in the
   abandoned teak plantation. Eleven species were identified as potential
   indicators of environmental deterioration if their numbers were to
   decrease. Frogs and toads were the best indicators in the moist forest,
   while lizards were the most suitable indicators for savanna and
   deciduous forest. No snakes were identified as indicators. It is
   concluded that herpetofauna can be useful and cost-effective indicators
   of environmental change. (c) 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {Coastal communities are experiencing rapid changes on their livelihood
   due to the degradation of coastal areas and growing tourism. We analyze
   the changes in the diet of two fishing communities from the southeastern
   Brazilian coast, in regard to their consumption of animal protein. Using
   multivariate methods, we followed the diet of 32 households through the
   24-hour recall method (three days per month, September 1998 to August
   1999) in order to compare the niche breadth of the communities, and to
   verify the relationships between fish consumption and socioeconomic
   characteristics. The nutritional quality of the diets is analyzed. Even
   with the partial abandonment of fishing activities, fishing activity
   still guides fish consumption. Nutritional adequacy is above the
   recommended levels for protein intake, but is below it for food energy.
   Non-local industrialized food items influence the increase of the niche
   breadth. The abandonment of livelihood activities that historically
   assured Caicara's self-sufficiency are resulting in the food

Title = {Recovery \& identification of human Y-STR DNA from immatures of
   chrysomya albiceps (Diptera: Calliphoridae). Simulation of sexual
   crime investigation involving victim corpse in state of decay},
Journal = {FORENSIC SCIENCE INTERNATIONAL},

Abstract = {The number of sexual crimes in Brazil, as in several other countries, is
   very high. In many of these crimes the women raped are murdered and
   their bodies are found days later, in an advanced state of
   decomposition, with intense cadaverous fauna. Forensic Entomology
   studies insects and other arthropods that can be used in the expert
   analysis of various types of crimes. Diptera, the order of insects that
   comprises the two-winged or true flies, represents one of the largest
   known groups of insects and is the principal source of cadaveric
   entomofauna. Members of its Calliphoridae family are observed in
   cadavers in all phases of decomposition. The retrieval and
   identification of human Y-STR DNA from the gastrointestinal tract of
   Calliphoridae species Chrysomya albiceps maggots and pupae can provide a
   good tool for the gathering of evidence in sexual crime investigations
   involving rape and death, in which the abandoned victim's body is found
   in a putrefied state. In this study, the animal model used was a female
   pig, Sus scrofa, which was sacrificed in a forested area with three
   shots from a 0.40 calibre Taurus pistol, and inoculated with semen to
   its anal and vaginal regions, simulating rape and homicide. During
   decomposition, 20-80 maggots were collected every 24 h and preserved in
   70 \% alcohol, totalling 289 maggots and 157 pupae (446 immatures) over
   a period of 14 days (336 h) of decomposition. Each maggot was then
   dissected for removal of the digestive tract, which was placed in
   extraction buffer. The molecular phase proceeded with extraction,
   quantification, amplification and capillary electrophoresis of samples,
   testing 16 STR loci of the Y chromosome. It was possible to establish a
   partial Y-STR DNA profile, with the amplification of up to eight sites,
   by considering a combination of the samples taken at hours 144 h, 168 h,
   192 h, 216 h, 240 h, 288 h, 312 h and 336 h. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {The distribution of sources and sinks of carbon among the world's
   ecosystems is uncertain. Some analyses show northern midlatitude lands
   to be a large sink, whereas the tropics are a net source(1); other
   analyses show the tropics to be nearly neutral. whereas northern
   mid-latitudes are a small sink(2,3). Here we show that the annual flux
   of carbon from deforestation and abandonment of agricultural lands in
   the Brazilian Amazon was a source of about 0.2 g C yr(-1) over the
   period 1989-1998 (1 Pg is 10(15) g). This estimate is based on annual
   rates of deforestation and spatially detailed estimates of
   deforestation, regrowing forests and biomass. Logging may add another
   5-10\% to this estimate(4), and fires may double the magnitude of the
   source in years following a drought(4), The annual source of carbon from
   land-use change and fire approximately offsets the sink calculated for
   natural ecosystems in the region(5,6). Thus this large area of tropical
   forest is nearly balanced with respect to carbon, but has an interannual
   variability of +/- 0.2 PgC yr(-1).},

Abstract = {Resource availability can influence animal movement causing changes in
   home-range size and arrangement between seasons. We investigated the
   influence of acuri palm (Attalea phalerata) on the occupancy of agouti
   Dasyprocta azare during both the dry and rainy seasons, as well as the
   abandonment probabilities in the transition between seasons in the
   Brazilian Pantanal. The agoutis occupied a high proportion of the
   forested areas in the rainy season (0.83), but the occupancy decreased
   in the dry season (0.39). In the rainy season, occupancy by agoutis was
   not correlated with acuri palm availability, while in the dry season, it
   was positively correlated with the palm's availability. The acuri palm
   availability also drove the agoutis' probability of site abandonment
   from the rainy to the dry season, with higher abandonment probability in
   sites with low acuri palm availability. These findings show that this
   large-seeded palm can be an important resource for the agoutis'
   populations during the fruit-scarcity period. The acuri palm seeds may
   be particularly important for agoutis using fragmented forests, given
   that the large-seeded palms are able to persist even in small fragments,
   which is untrue for other important resource.},

Title = {The effects of plant structure on the spatial and microspatial
   distribution of a bromeliad-living jumping spider (Salticidae)},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2005},
Volume = {74},
Number = {1},
Pages = {12-21},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {1. In several regions of South America, the neotropical jumping spider
   Psecas chapoda inhabits and reproduces strictly on the bromeliad
   Bromelia balansae. Previous studies reported that this spider is more
   frequent on bromeliads in grasslands than on those growing in forests,
   and on larger plants, but only when the bromeliads are without
   inflorescence. Upon blooming, B. balansae fold their leaves back,
   thereby changing the plant architecture from a tri-dimensional to a
   bi-dimensional flattened shape, and our hypothesis is that this
   alteration affects the spider's habitat-selection decisions.
   2. In the present study, we examined experimentally the effects of
   inflorescence, plant size and blockade of the axil of the leaves (spider
   shelters) of forest bromeliads on the colonization of a bromeliad by P.
   chapoda. By using sticky traps, we also compared prey availability in
   grassland and forest.
   3. Plants with simulated inflorescence were colonized at a lower
   frequency than those without inflorescence simulation. Grassland
   bromeliads in which the rosettes were blocked with dry leaves were
   colonized less frequently than open bromeliads, whereas forest
   bromeliads from which dry leaves had been removed were not colonized.
   Spiders generally abandoned bromeliads in which three-quarters of the
   length of the leaves had been removed, although females with eggsacs
   remained on these plants. Prey availability (biomass and number) was up
   to 18 fold higher in the grassland than in the forest. These results
   suggest that microhabitat structure and prey availability shape the
   spatial distribution of P. chapoda populations.
   4. Our findings suggest that Psecas chapoda can evaluate, in fine
   detail, the physical state of its microhabitat, and this unusual
   spider-plant association is readily destabilized by changes in the
   microhabitat (i.e., it is strictly dependent on the size and morphology
   of the host plant). This study is one of the few to report a strict
   association between a spider species and its host plant, and also one of
   the few to examine the effects of habitat and microhabitat structure on
   the spatial distribution of active hunters on plants.},

Title = {Dung removal by dung beetles in tropical livestock-dominated landscapes:
   Role of livestock grazing abandonment, local environment, and community
   attributes},
Journal = {APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {200},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Cattle farming is a prominent economic activity in tropical ecosystems.
   However, this system can lead to biodiversity loss and decreased
   ecosystem functions. Due to land degradation or changes in farming
   practices, areas with different times after cattle grazing removal are
   new and common habitats in tropical landscapes. Therefore, understanding
   the impact of livestock grazing abandonment on the relationship between
   biodiversity and ecosystem function is crucial for tropical pastureland
   livestock production. We assessed the influence of livestock grazing
   abandonment (cattle removal time), local environmental conditions
   (herbaceous vegetation density, sand content, and soil compaction), and
   dung beetle community attributes (biomass and functional dispersion) on
   dung removal rates in pasturelands. We conducted this study at 24
   natural grassland sites in the Brazilian Pantanal, a tropical landscape
   dominated by livestock. Our findings reveal that community attributes
   primarily explain the variation in dung removal rates, while the effects
   of local environment and cattle removal time were insignificant. The
   relationships between dung beetle functional diversity and ecosystem
   functioning may show substantial context-dependent variation. Biomass
   was particularly important in explaining shifts in dung removal. These
   results underscore the direct link between the decline of biomass of
   larger-bodied dung beetles and the loss of ecosystem services associated
   with dung removal, such as parasitic control and soil fertilization.
   Therefore, conserving dung beetle biomass of larger-bodied dung beetles
   through effective management plans is vital to sustain ecological
   functions in tropical livestock-dominated landscapes.},

Journal = {GEOBIOLOGY},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {4},
Number = {3},
Pages = {215-223},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Assessing patterns of abundance and distribution of Amazonian species is
   still an overwhelming task that requires integration of multiple
   disciplines. This work is based on background information gathered from
   previous reconstructions of the geological history of the lower Amazon
   drainage basin, in order to analyse biodiversity patterns within the
   context of landscape transformation. A highly dynamic geological
   scenario is depicted for this area during the Plio-Pleistocene and
   Holocene, which consisted of a large palaeovalley formed as a response
   of tectonic reactivation. This palaeovalley was filled with sediments
   transported by a north/northwest orientated palaeo-Tocantins River. The
   palaeodrainage became abandoned as the main river course was deviated to
   the northeast, initiating the separation of Marajo Island from mainland.
   Geology had a direct impact on the modern physiognomy, with open
   vegetation dominating in areas with Holocene sedimentation, while closed
   forests prevailing in older Quaternary and, probably also, Pliocene
   terrains. Data from fossil and modern mammalian groups indicate the
   connection of Marajo Island to the mainland during the Last Glacial
   Maximum, when open vegetation seems to have dominated. Tectonic
   subsidence was responsible for the maintenance of this vegetation
   pattern on the eastern side of the Marajo Island, keeping it as a
   habitat favourable for savanna adapted faunal elements. Based on this
   kind of information, this work attempts to highlight the importance of
   integrating studies combining geological and biological events as the
   key to understand biodiversity patterns in Amazonia. It is expected to
   open new lines of research dealing with the comprehension of ecology,
   species and genetic diversity, biogeography, evolutionary scenarios, and
   speciation mechanisms.},

Title = {Understanding Amazonian fluvial rias based on a Late

Journal = {EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {40},
Number = {3},
Pages = {285-292},
Month = {MAR 15},
Abstract = {Fluvial rias are elongated lakes at tributary mouths that can reach
   dozens of kilometers in length, constituting one of the most remarkable
   features in the Amazonian landscape. Thus far, definitive data which
   documents the genesis of fluvial rias have not been published. The main
   goal of this work was to integrate morphological, sedimentological and
   chronological information in order to characterize fluvial paleorias in
   the interfluve of the Purus and Madeira Rivers and discuss the most
   likely hypothesis for their genesis. These paleorias were first observed
   through remote sensing imagery as several elongated and interconnecting
   belts of open vegetation that are in sharp contact with the surrounding
   dense forest. The belts are branched and form a dendritic pattern
   similar to many modern drainage networks. The sedimentary record of
   these belts revealed the prevalence of sharp-based sandstones and
   mudstones arranged into fining-upward successions, which are compatible
   with deposition within channels. Active channel and abandoned channel
   deposits were recognized. These are topped by continuous mudstones
   related to rapid channel abandonment and formation of a low energy basin
   or ria environment. Radiocarbon dating of these deposits recorded only
   Late Pleistocene and Holocene ages ranging from 21 547-22 285calyrbp to
   5928-6124calyrbp. This chronology for sediment deposition is not
   compatible with the hypothesis of Amazonian rias being formed by fluvial
   erosion during the Last Glaciation Maximum low sea level, with sediment
   accumulation during the subsequent Holocene transgression. Instead, the
   studied paleorias record previous tributaries of the Madeira River that
   became abandoned as the position of this river shifted southeastward and
   its interfluve tilted northward, inverting the drainage systems.
   Therefore, a neotectonic origin of some Amazonian paleorias seems most
   likely. This hypothesis should be considered in further investigations
   aiming at understanding the origin of numerous modern fluvial rias that
   typify the Amazonian landscape. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley \& Sons,

Title = {Monitoring cropland abandonment with Landsat time series},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {246},
Month = {SEP 1},
Abstract = {Cropland abandonment is a widespread land-use change, but it is
   difficult to monitor with remote sensing because it is often spatially
   dispersed, easily confused with spectrally similar land-use classes such
   as grasslands and fallow fields, and because post-agricultural
   succession can take different forms in different biomes. Due to these
   difficulties, prior assessments of cropland abandonment have largely
   been limited in resolution, extent, or both. However, cropland
   abandonment has wide-reaching consequences for the environment, food
   production, and rural livelihoods, which is why new approaches to
   monitor long-term cropland abandonment in different biomes accurately
   are needed. Our goals were to 1) develop a new approach to map the
   extent and the timing of abandoned cropland using the entire Landsat
   time series, and 2) test this approach in 14 study regions across the
   globe that capture a wide range of environmental conditions as well as
   the three major causes of abandonment, i.e., social, economic, and
   environmental factors. Our approach was based on annual maps of active
   cropland and non-cropland areas using Landsat summary metrics for each
   year from 1987 to 2017. We streamlined per-pixel classifications by
   generating multi-year training data that can be used for annual
   classification. Based on the annual classifications, we analyzed
   land-use trajectories of each pixel in order to distinguish abandoned
   cropland, stable cropland, non-cropland, and fallow fields. In most
   study regions, our new approach separated abandoned cropland accurately
   from stable cropland and other classes. The classification accuracy for
   abandonment was highest in regions with industrialized agriculture
   (area-adjusted F1 score for Mato Grosso in Brazil: 0.8; Volgograd in
   Russia: 0.6), and drylands (e.g., Shaanxi in China, Nebraska in the
   U.S.: 0.5) where fields were large or spectrally distinct from
   non-cropland. Abandonment of subsistence agriculture with small field
   sizes (e.g., Nepal: 0.1) or highly variable climate (e.g., Sardinia in
   Italy: 0.2) was not accurately mapped. Cropland abandonment occurred in
   all study regions but was especially prominent in developing countries
   and formerly socialist states. In summary, we present here an approach
   for monitoring cropland abandonment with Landsat imagery, which can be
   applied across diverse biomes and may thereby improve the understanding
   of the drivers and consequences of this important land-use change
   process.},

Abstract = {Land tenure has been considered one of the key factors that define
   patterns and change in land-use systems. This paper examines the
   implications of land reform for household decisions regarding patterns
   of land use, agricultural intensification, and forest conservation. We
   look at an Amazonian caboclo settlement in the Lower Amazon that had
   experienced land reform by the end of the 1980s. Results show that
   defined land tenure is not enough to guarantee agricultural
   intensification and forest conservation. In fact, several factors
   working at different scales are affecting land-use change in the region.
   At the settlement level, privatization of upland forest has led to an
   overall increase in cultivated land - pasture and annual crops - and
   increasing deforestation rates. However, at the farm-property level,
   different systems of agricultural production - intensive, extensive, or
   abandonment of land - occur according to availability of labor, and
   capital, and access to different natural resources.},

Booktitle = {FROM SYSTEM COMPLEXITY TO EMERGENT PROPERTIES},
Series = {Understanding Complex Systems Springer Complexity},
Year = {2009},
Pages = {157-163},
Abstract = {Geography studies the organisation of territories in their physical
   dimensions as well as in their social dimensions. This is thus a
   knowledge about emergence of forms such as the scattering of fallows and
   then forests over abandoned agricultural soils, the growth of a city or
   of a transport network, or the spreading of a pioneer front in Brazil or
   Siberia.
   In order to account for the emergence of spreading or stationary forms,
   a lot of scientists from other disciplines often refer to a theory
   simultaneously suggested by Fisher, Kolmogorov, Petrovskii and Piskunov,
   and usually designated by the acronym FKPP. Numerous papers and books
   dedicated to this theory and to the models derived from, such as Turing
   activator-inhibitor model or their generalisation by Meinhardt. As the
   creation of a chemical, its production and growth in time, is usually
   obtained by reaction, this theory is generally called ``theory of
   reaction-diffusion{''}. We have highlighted the interest of this theory
   since 1985, at the European Colloquium on Theoretical and Quantitative
   Geography. But it was not a source of inspiration for the geographers.
   We suggest then to insist on the components that should be added to make
   this theory effective in geography. Beyond the long distance
   interactions designated as convection, advection, turbulence in nature
   sciences or transport in the societal sphere, it is advisable to think
   about the initial conditions that strongly influence the emergence of
   the geographical forms and more about the introduction of human actors

Abstract = {Some neotropical vespids are known for their association with other
   insects and vertebrate taxa. In the present study about the wasp
   diversity in the Ducke Reserve, Manaus, Brazil five active colonies and
   an abandoned one of Polybia rejecta, and one active colony of Synoeca
   virginea were found associated with ant nests of Azteca aff. chartifex
   (Formicidae). A single colony of Polybia rejecta was found beside nests
   of Cacicus cela (Passeriformes: Icteridae). These associations appear to
   be related both to protection of the wasps nests by the ants and the
   protection of the ants nests by the wasps, as well as to protection of
   the bird nests by the wasps. The wasps take advantage of the tolerance
   of the ants, nesting near their colonies to obtain protection, so
   escaping attack by other ant species that feed on the immature wasps.
   Birds in turn take advantage of protection by these wasps against
   potential predators. This work adds new data to the study of
   associations of wasp species found in Central Brazilian Amazon, with
   descriptions of observed behaviors and photographs of such associations.},

Journal = {AUSTRAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {47},

Pages = {928-938},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Livestock is a globally widespread farming practice, with benefits and
   harms for biodiversity. Biodiversity responses to vegetation and soil
   conditions associated with cattle grazing removal are poorly understood
   in tropical grassy ecosystems, especially in a long-term chronosequence.
   In this study, we aimed to identify the main drivers of local conditions
   on dung beetle taxonomic and functional diversity across a
   chronosequence of natural grasslands with different cattle grazing
   removal ages. We expect that vegetation and soil variables associated
   with environmental changes caused by longer time after cattle grazing
   removal will drive the taxonomic and functional diversity of dung
   beetles. We sampled dung beetles and recorded local environmental
   filters (vegetation and soil variables) in 14 natural grasslands with
   distinct cattle grazing removal ages (from 3 months to 22 years) and
   also in 10 reference sites (with cattle grazing). We used structural
   equation models to evaluate the relationships between the most
   informative explanations (vegetation and soil variables) of dung beetle
   taxonomic and functional metrics. Our results provide evidences that
   local conditions related to vegetation and soil variables in natural
   grasslands affect the taxonomic and functional diversity of dung beetles
   differently. Soil conditions (compaction and silt content) had more
   influence, mostly negative, on taxonomic metrics, while vegetation
   complexity had more influence on functional metrics, with positive or
   negative effects depending on the functional metric evaluated.
   Understanding the temporal change in vegetation and soil conditions can
   shed light on the process of recovering biodiversity and ecosystem
   functions in areas with different times of abandonment of livestock
   farming. Finally, using taxonomic and functional approaches together can
   also help to better understand how organisms are responding to the
   process of abandoning livestock farming over time.},

Title = {Arthropod facilitation mediated by abandoned dead domatia},
Journal = {ECOSPHERE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {12},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {In ant-plant mutualistic interactions, plants provide shelter (domatia)
   and/or food to ants and in exchange, and ants provide protection against
   herbivores. After plant tissue senescence, ants are expected to abandon
   dead domatia, leaving these empty spaces available for other arthropods.
   In this study, we tested for the role of the mutualistic interaction
   between Cordia alliodora and Azteca pittieri in promoting new habitats
   for arthropods through abandoned dead domatia. We predicted that species
   richness, abundance, and colonization frequency of secondary arthropods
   would be greater in dead branch domatia (dead domatia) compared with
   live branch domatia (live domatia). During March 2019, we selected 38 C.
   alliodora trees in a Mexican tropical dry forest. For each tree, we
   collected five live and five dead domatia, for 380 domatia in total. We
   found six morphospecies of secondary arthropods colonizing live domatia,
   while 42 were present in dead domatia. Ants were the most species-rich
   group (10 species) in abandoned dead domatia and utilized them as
   nesting sites (25 nests). Secondary arthropod species richness,
   abundance, and colonization frequency were greater in dead domatia
   compared with live domatia. We concluded that the Azteca-Cordia
   mutualistic interaction is an important habitat facilitator by promoting
   new habitats for arthropods through abandoned dead domatia.},

Abstract = {Topsoil translocation has been used for vegetation restoration
   throughout the world, but it has been poorly tested within savannas.
   This study describes Brazilian savanna (cerrado) regeneration for the
   first 3 years following topsoil translocation. The topsoil was stripped
   from 2.5 ha of savanna and spread on 1 ha of an abandoned laterite
   quarry in the Federal District, Brazil. We assessed vegetation structure
   and species composition in 18 circular plots (3.14/m(2)) after 5 and 15
   months and in 30 circular plots after 37 months. In the last floristic
   survey, the coverage of herbs was estimated using the step-point method.
   To verify the source of regeneration, a total of 181 shrubs and trees
   were excavated over the first 2 surveys. After 3 years, 24, 40, and 21
   species of herbs, shrubs, and trees, respectively, had been recorded by
   the surveys. Of the 33 families found, Fabaceae, Poaceae, and Asteraceae
   were the most representative. At 5 and 15 months, 91 and 83\% of the
   individuals (shrubs and trees combined) were derived from resprouting,
   respectively. Shrub and tree stem density reached 3.2/m(2) at 5 months,
   but declined to 0.5/m(2) at 37 months. By the final survey, native and
   exotic grasses completely covered the ground. Topsoil translocation was
   effective for the propagation of native herbs, shrubs, and trees,
   despite the need to control invasive grasses. The large number of shrub
   and tree resprouts from roots suggests that the bud bank is an important
   component of the topsoil for savanna restoration.},

Abstract = {Canopy arthropods, mainly from palm trees, are little known in the
   Brazilian Cerrado. In order to describe the arthropod community
   structure associated with the crown of Mauritia flexuosa (Arecaceae), we
   sampled 150 palm trees in six ``veredas{''} of the Federal District,
   Brazil, in wild, rural and periurban areas in the rainy season. The
   arthropods within abandoned bird nests, mammal refuges, leaves and
   organic matter were manually collected, preserved in ethanol 70\% and
   separated by order, family, morphospecies and feeding guilds. Stem
   height and diameter of the palm crowns were measured and leaves and bird
   nests were counted. We collected 3,862 arthropods, from 15 orders, 45
   families and 135 morphospecies. The most abundant orders were Coleoptera
   (28.6\%), Blattodea (21.8\%), Collembola (11.4\%) and Hemiptera
   (10.2\%). The families Blaberidae, Entomobryidae, Reduviidae, Oniscidae,
   Staphylinidae, Carabidae and Formicidae, represented 82.1 \% of all
   individuals collected. The majority of morphospecies was not abundant,
   71 (52.6\%) were represented by less than 1 individual/tree.
   Coleopterans accounted for the highest number of morphospecies (43.7\%)
   followed by Araneae (20.0\%). The analysis of the arthropod feeding
   guilds showed prevalence of predatory/hernatophagous ones (36.0\%).
   Arthropod richness and abundance presented smaller values for periurban
   environment. The number of bird nests presented positive correlation
   with abundance and richness; this was not found when considering the
   measurements of the palm trees. The importance of M.flexuosa for the
   maintenance of the arthropod fauna of the ``veredas{''} in Cerrado biome
   is discussed.},

Abstract = {Words and terms evoke responses in us, independently of their original
   meaning. Precise language matters because terminology can affect
   conservation. For example, current deforestation rates put the Amazon in
   the spotlight of global conservation, particularly after the
   ``savannization of the Amazon{''} was proposed. This term associates
   cleared or degraded forests with savannas, reinforcing prejudices
   against natural savannas. The Cerrado is the world's largest and richest
   savanna, but receives less conservation attention and resources.
   Firstly, we showed a multisector Cerrado neglect: number of protected
   areas, non-governmental organizations, academic human resources, and
   companies were larger in the Amazon, but deforested area was
   proportionally smaller. Secondly, we analyzed the academic use of
   ``savannization of the Amazon.{''} In all 481 studies using this term,
   human action was implied, and most meant that degraded Amazon does not
   become old-growth savanna. We propose abandoning the use of
   ``savannization of the Amazon{''}, promoting the support and attention
   the Cerrado needs. (c) 2024 Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf

Abstract = {Exotic species can threaten biodiversity by disrupting ecological
   interactions among native species. Highly-attractive exotic species can
   exert a `magnet effect' by attracting native pollinators, which may have
   either competitive or facilitative effects on co-flowering native
   plants. However, those effects may be context-dependent. We used a
   mistletoe-hummingbird pollination system in the Valdivian rainforest
   (southern Chile) to test whether the exotic tree Eucalyptus globulus (a
   highly attractive species to pollinators) acts as a magnet species,
   affecting the co-flowering native mistletoe. We compared hummingbird
   abundance, visitation rates, and activity patterns between native forest
   and abandoned E. globulus plantations. We found that hummingbirds were
   more abundant and visited more flowers at the plantation irrespective of
   E. globulus flowering. We observed a significant change of pollinator
   activity at the native habitat during E. globulus flowering, as
   hummingbirds visited mistletoe flowers more frequently early in the
   morning at the plantations and in the afternoon at the native forests.
   Our results showed that E. globulus acts as an exotic magnet species and
   can alter pollinator abundance and behavior. Our findings demonstrate
   the importance of considering local- and landscape-scale processes to
   understand the effects of magnet species on native plants and suggest
   that magnet species may influence even highly-attractive plants.},

Abstract = {School dropout is a daily challenge for educational institutions. In the
   specific case of higher education, high dropout rates lead to financial
   losses and a shortage of professionals in the market. This research
   aimed to develop and evaluate a predictive model to identify students
   prone to dropout, using data from a semester-based self-assessment model
   of undergraduate courses at Federal University of Paraiba (UFPB). The
   study analyzed the relationship between school dropout and institutional
   self-assessment using educational data mining and the CRISP-DM
   methodology, followed by exploratory analysis and data preparation for
   classification. Various modeling techniques, such as Decision Trees,
   Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines, were applied, with the
   models evaluated using performance metrics, revealing an accuracy of
   87.97\%, precisionof 91.72\%, recall of 91.67\%, and F-measure of
   91.57\% in identifying students with a high probability of dropout.
   Approximately 59\% of active students at UFPB, admitted from 2017
   onwards, showed a high probability of abandoning their courses in the
   proposed predictive model tests. This information can support
   institutional decisions and the implementation of effective policies and
   actions against dropouts, aiming to improve academic outcomes. The study
   contributes to advancements in predicting school dropout, providing
   valuable insights for decision-making and preventive strategies at UFPB
   and other higher education institutions.},

Abstract = {In the southeastern United States (SE), the conversion of abandoned
   agricultural land to forests is the dominant feature of land-cover
   change. However, few attempts have been made to quantify the impact of
   such conversion on surface temperature. Here, this issue is explored
   experimentally and analytically in three adjacent ecosystems (a
   grass-covered old-field, OF, a planted pine forest, PP, and a hardwood
   forest, HW) representing a successional chronosequence in the SE. The
   results showed that changes in albedo alone can warm the surface by 0.9
   degrees C for the OF-to-PP conversion, and 0.7 degrees C for the
   OF-to-HW conversion on annual time scales. However, changes in
   eco-physiological and aerodynamic attributes alone can cool the surface
   by 2.9 and 2.1 degrees C, respectively. Both model and measurements
   consistently suggest a stronger over-all surface cooling for the
   OF-to-PP conversion, and the reason is attributed to leaf area
   variations and its impacts on boundary layer conductance.},

Abstract = {The geomorphological analysis of the river Tocantins alluvial area was
   carried out by remote sensing techniques, jointly with studies of
   sedimentary facies, mineralogy and geochemistry, pollen and spores, C
   and N isotopes data and radiocarbon dating of a sediment core from a
   floodplain lake, near the river Tocantins in the southeastern Amazon
   region. The aim was to identify and discuss the relationship between the
   main geomorphological processes and climatic factors, as well as their
   influence on vegetation patterns. The data indicate three phases of
   sediment and organic matter accumulation associated with vegetation
   changes during the Holocene: in Phase 1 (> 7760 +/- A 80 cal yrs b.p.),
   the channel was gradually being disconnected from its main course,
   accumulating organic matter from terrestrial woody plants; in Phase 2 (>
   7760 +/- A 80 to 5145 +/- A 175 cal yrs b.p.), the very low energy flows
   allowed the deposition of autochthonous organic mud from suspension.
   Herbaceous vegetation and a Mauritia palm-swamp dominated the study
   area, followed by an increase in the contribution of freshwater
   dissolved organic carbon (DOC) to the lake; Phase 3 (5145 +/- A 175 cal
   yrs b.p. until present) records the expansion of ferns and arboreal
   plants, and greater freshwater organic matter input into the lake with
   anoxic water conditions. The development of the studied lake occurred by
   geomorphological changes and the filling process of an abandoned channel
   according to hydrodynamics and vegetation changes which were probably
   influenced by climatic changes during the Holocene.},

Title = {Beneath the surface: co-habitation of recruits of the land crab
   Johngarthia lagostoma and its relevance for conservation on
   oceanic islands},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF THE MARINE BIOLOGICAL ASSOCIATION OF THE UNITED KINGDOM},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {104},

Abstract = {Gecarcinid crabs have their life cycles in antagonistic scenarios, with
   their larvae developing in the sea and the juvenile/adult phases
   occurring on land. Adults migrate from land to sea to release their
   larvae, which return to land upon reaching the megalopa stage.
   Recruitment and early instar traits in gecarcinids crabs remain unknown,
   leading to some species lacking age-specific information. Despite
   massive recruitment observed in some insular gecarcinid species (e.g.
   Gecarcoidea natalis), recruits are generally expected to be few and
   exhibit cryptic behaviour, potentially occupying the burrows of
   conspecifics. We evaluated whether recruits of Johngarthia lagostoma on
   Trindade Island, Brazil, co-inhabit larger conspecific burrows,
   analysing this occurrence and examining their growth patterns, density,
   and body size across different lunar phases. Johngarthia lagostoma
   recruits inhabit conspecific burrows, either abandoned or occupied by
   adult crabs, but always with leaves stored in the inner chamber.
   Recruits in co-inhabiting behaviour reach a maximum carapace width of
   7.3 mm, and after that, they are likely detected by the adults and
   possibly cannibalized or leave burrows naturally. During the full moon,
   the higher density and smaller size of recruits were recorded,
   indicating a recruitment lunar phase. It is crucial to ascertain the
   prevalence of co-inhabitation behaviours in other land crab species to
   expand the knowledge about recruitment patterns in these key community
   species.},

Abstract = {Background: African C4 grasses threatens newly restored areas in
   Neotropical savannas. Allelopathy exhibited by some native species may
   contribute to ecological restoration.Aims: To establish the potential
   use of Lepidaploa aurea (Asteraceae) in ecological restoration of
   invaded savannas, we evaluated its allelopathic effects on two invasive
   grasses, a native grass, and two native trees (one savanna and one
   riparian forest species).Methods: We tested the allelopathic effects of
   the leaves and roots of L. aurea in a growth chamber, a greenhouse, and
   in field experiments.Results: Leaf extracts reduced the growth of all
   other species in the growth chamber experiment. Root extracts reduced
   growth in one invasive grass and promoted root growth in the savanna
   tree. The invasive grass and riparian forest tree were negatively
   affected when planted in soil where L. aurea had grown, whereas the
   savanna tree showed increased growth. Lepidaploa aurea litter reduced
   growth in one invasive grass species and increased root biomass
   accumulation in the native grass species.Conclusions: Lepidaploa aurea
   negatively affected the growth of invasive grasses, through plant
   extracts, litter and through soil. These patterns could explain its
   ability to colonise abandoned pasturelands and its high success of
   establishing in restoration areas.},

Abstract = {Recent energy and climate policies, particularly in the developed world,
   have increased demand for bioenergy(2) as an alternative, which has led
   to both direct and indirect land-use changes and an array of
   environmental and socio-economic concerns. A comprehensive understanding
   of the land-use dynamics of bioenergy crop production is essential for
   the development of sustainable bioenergy and land-use policies. In this
   paper, we review the patterns and dynamics of land-use change associated
   with bioenergy crops (hereafter referred to as `bioenergy-driven
   land-use change'). The review focuses on four regions as the most
   prominent locations in which these patterns and changes occur: Brazil;
   Indonesia and Malaysia; the United States of America (U.S.A.); and the
   European Union (EU). The review confirms that bioenergy-driven land-use
   change has affected and will impact most severely on the `land- and
   resource-abundant' developing regions, such as Brazil, where economic
   development takes priority over sustainable land-use policies, and the
   enforcement capability is limited. Opportunities for more effective
   policy are available through the development of international climate
   change policy (e.g. REDD under the UNFCCC), and certification criteria
   for sustainable bioenergy products (e.g. EU RED). However, bioenergy
   produced from no and/or less land-using feedstocks (e.g. wastes and
   residues), and their associated technologies must be given higher
   priority to minimise bioenergy-driven land-use change and its negative
   impacts. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Year = {1994},
Volume = {8},

Abstract = {The socioeconomic and ecological aspects of land-use change are
   interrelated, especially in the Brazilian Amazon, where immigrants are
   rapidly cutting the forest to establish farms. A computer simulation has
   been developed that projects land-use changes, carbon release, and the
   time a family can remain on a farm lot as a function of initial soil and
   vegetation conditions, market and road infrastructure, and decision
   variables. The model simulates extremes of land-use practices and
   typical land-use conditions for central Rondonia, Brazil. Typical
   land-use practices in Rondonia are based on published accounts of
   farmers' activities. The most severe practices are defined based on
   extreme land-management conditions along the Transamazon Highway. The
   best land-use practices are innovative farming techniques that use a
   diversity of perennial crops. Model projections using the typical
   land-use scenario produce changes in land cleared, carbon release, and
   farmer turnover rates representative of central Rondonia, based on
   interviews with 87 farmers.  Results from both the model projections and
   the interview data show that farmers who have been on the lots a decade
   have cleared about half of the lot.  The most striking result is the
   similarity in the typical and worst-case scenarios over the 40-year
   projection period in the percentage of land cleared and carbon released
   and in the number of families on the farm lots and abandoning the lots
   over time. Model results from the best-case scenario compare well to the
   three farmers out of 87 interviewed who practice innovative farming.  In
   both cases, farmers who have been on their land an average of eight
   years have deforested less than 20\% of the lot.  Spatial indices of
   fractal dimension and contagion are used to quantify the effects of the
   different land-management practices.  Changes in the fractal index over
   the 40 years of projected land management demonstrate the decrease in
   complexity as a forested region becomes dominated by agriculture for the
   typical and worst-case scenarios.  Low values of the contagion index
   indicates that a heterogeneous mix of land uses is retained with the
   best-case scenario.  These results suggest that crop diversity and
   nontraditional techniques provide both a social and environmental
   improvement over the other scenarios:  the people are able to maintain
   themselves on the land, less carbon is released, and the land maintains
   a mix of habitat types.  The model results illustrate that both social
   and environmental effects of land-management practices need to be
   considered.},

Abstract = {The neotropical bracken fern Pteridium arachnoideum (Kaulf.) Maxon.
   (Dennstaedtiaceae) is described as an aggressive pioneer plant species.
   It invades abandoned or newly burned areas and represents a management
   challenge at these invaded sites. Native to the Atlantic Forest and
   Cerrado (Tropical Savanna) Brazilian biomes, P. arachnoideum has
   nevertheless become very problematic in these conservation hotspots.
   Despite some reports suggesting a possible role of allelopathy in this
   plant's dominance, until now there has been little evidence of isolated
   and individually identified compounds with phytotoxic activities present
   in its tissues or in the surrounding environment. Thus, the aim of this
   study was to investigate the allelopathic potential of P. arachnoideum
   by isolating and identifying any secondary metabolites with phytotoxic
   activity in its tissues, litter, and soil. Bioguided phytochemical
   investigation led to the isolation and identification of the
   proanthocyanidin selligueain A as the major secondary compound in the
   green fronds and litter of this fern. It is produced by P. arachnoideum
   in its green fronds, remains unaltered during the senescence process,
   and is the major secondary compound present in litter. Selligueain A
   showed phytotoxic activity against the selected target species sesame
   (Sesamum indicum) early development. In particular, the compound
   inhibited root and stem growth, and root metaxylem cell size but did not
   affect chlorophyll content. This compound can be considered as an
   allelochemical because it is present in the soil under P. arachnoideum
   patches as one of the major compounds in the soil solution. This is the
   first report of the presence of selligueain A in any member of the
   Dennstaedtiaceae family and the first time an isolated and identified
   allelochemical produced by members of the Pteridium species complex has
   been described. This evidence of selligueain A as a putative
   allelochemical of P. arachnoideum reinforces the role of allelopathy in
   the dominance processes of this plant in the areas where it occurs.},

Title = {Temporal segmentation method for 30-meter long-term mapping of abandoned
   and reclaimed croplands in Inner Mongolia, China},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION},

Abstract = {At the end of the last century, the expansion of agricultural land in
   the arid and semi-arid regions of northern China intensified the
   conflict between agricultural development and ecological protection.
   Accurately mapping abandoned cropland is crucial for balancing these
   competing interests. This research evaluates the effectiveness of an
   innovative remote sensing method for producing 30-meter-resolution
   long-term maps of abandoned and reclaimed croplands in Inner Mongolia,
   China, using a temporal segmentation approach developed with Google
   Earth Engine. The method integrates ground sample collection of major
   crops and inactive cropland with Normalized Difference Vegetation Index
   (NDVI) analysis during key growth stages, enabling precise
   classification of cultivation status. By employing a binary
   classification strategy and adaptive optimization, the efficiency of
   sample generation improved, providing more effective samples for the
   Random Forest algorithm. Cropland status maps were successfully
   generated for Inner Mongolia from 2000 to 2022 with annual accuracy
   between 97\% and 99\%. The Temporal Segmentation of Abandoned and
   Reclaimed Cropland (TSARC) method created time series maps of abandoned
   and reclaimed cropland at a 30-meter resolution, achieving an overall
   accuracy of 87.61\%. The proposed remote sensing methodology reveals
   spatiotemporal trends in abandonment rates across arid and semi-humid
   regions, offering valuable insights for agricultural and environmental
   management in Inner Mongolia. Considering regional climatic,
   hydrological, and phenological conditions improves sample collection
   efficiency and cropland status monitoring. While designed for northern
   China, this method is also applicable to other single-season
   agricultural regions for varied agricultural land use monitoring.},

Title = {Enhanced spring warming in a Mediterranean mountain by atmospheric
   circulation},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},
Number = {1},
Month = {MAY 11},
Abstract = {We analyzed trends of air temperature across the Cevennes National Park
   in Southern France, a mid-altitude coastal mountain experiencing a rapid
   spread of forests at the expense of rangelands and submitted to
   Mediterranean Sea influences and so, impacted by local and regional
   processes of climate change. Since 1980, April to June warming trend
   reached a maximum temperature increase of + 0.124 degrees C year(-1) and
   uniform whatever the altitude. Minimum temperature increased by + 0.058
   degrees C year(-1) at 500 m altitude and + 0.089 degrees C year(-1) at
   1500 m. Concomitantly, forest cover is increasing by + 0.51\% year(-1).
   Using an intrinsic biophysical mechanism model, we demonstrated that, at
   monthly scale, the forest surface is 1.7-3.1 degrees C cooler than that
   of nearby grasslands. As a result, the decrease in albedo corresponding
   to the conversion from grasslands to dense forests, translates into a
   cooling of maximum air temperatures of 0.023 degrees C year(-1) which
   contributes to slow down the warming rate enhancement. Spring warming
   trends co-varied with negative WeMO phases associated with a low in the
   Gulf of Cadiz and an anticyclone in Central Europe. An east to west
   pressure gradient increases atmospheric humidity leading to a strong
   water vapor feedback, enhancing the forcing of thermal long wave
   radiations and hence the rise in temperature.},

Abstract = {This study evaluates causal relationships between chronic exposure of
   fish to metals and effects at different levels of biological
   organization based on a weight-of-evidence approach. Criteria for
   evaluation of causality were strength, consistency, and specificity of
   the association, as well as biological gradient and plausibility. Field
   sampling was conducted three times between 1998 and 2000, in Furnas
   Stream, impacted by an abandoned lead mine, and in three other
   locations, including two reference and one impacted sites. Levels of Pb,
   Zn, Cd, and Ag in sediments from the Furnas Stream exceeded background
   levels, and their concentrations were above sediment quality guidelines.
   Residual levels of metals in fish tissue were high enough to indicate
   reduced growth, reproduction and/or survival according to toxicological
   benchmarks. Lead-induced biochemical changes (ALA-D activity depletion)
   were observed in two species of siluriform catfish. The condition factor
   of a predatory catfish was reduced, and the percentage of prey
   generalists was higher in Furnas than at the noncontaminated sites.
   Reduction in fish community diversity and density was observed.
   Integration of data provided supporting evidence that observed effects
   on fish from the Furnas Stream resulted from long-term exposure to
   metals, however influences from other stressors cannot be ruled out.},

Year = {1997},
Volume = {47},

Pages = {49-57},
Abstract = {A case study on the nutrient input-output budget of slash and burn
   agriculture was carried out in Northeast-Para, Brazil, where such a
   land-use system has been practised for about 100 years. A common
   cropping period lasts for two years and the fields lie fallow for 4 to 8
   years. We quantified rates of deposition, fertilization, and losses due
   to the burn, harvest and leaching. Six fields of different phases in the
   rotational cycle were under study during a 19 month period. During the
   fallow period, the input of Na, K, Mg, N, P and S via deposition
   exceeded the estimated losses with the seepage water. The Ca budget was
   almost balanced. The balance of fields in the transition from the fallow
   to the cropping phase was negative for Na, K, Ca, Mg, N, and S. The P
   balance was positive when NPK fertilizer was applied, and negative
   without fertilizer application. The nutrient balance for K, Mg, Ca, N,
   and P was also negative on the field in transition from the cropping to
   the fallow period. The nutrient budget for an entire land-use cycle of 9
   years was estimated by the `'false time series approach''. In the case
   of an NPK fertilization during the cropping period there were net losses
   of 75 kg K ha(-1), 125 kg Ca ha(-1), 16 kg Mg ha(-1), 285 kg N ha(-1)
   and 13 kg S ha(-1). Na (86 kg ha(-1)) and P (11 kg ha(-1)) were
   accumulated. The harvest was the most important flux for the K (61\%)
   and P (62\%) output. The element transfer into the atmosphere during the
   burn caused the main losses of N (60\%), S (65\%), Ca (58\%) and Mg
   (41\%). The most important path of Na loss was leaching (92\%). The net
   K losses were severe as they represented 45\% of the K store found
   extractable in the soil down to 1m depth and in the aboveground biomass.
   The presented results may be useful in planning a sustainable and
   environmentally protective method of land-use within a shifting
   cultivation system. It is strongly recommended that slash burning be
   abandoned in order to keep the nutrients in the ecosystem.},

Abstract = {Emberizoides herbicola (Wedge-tailed Grass-finch), Emberizidae,
   Passeriformes, lives in various types of grasslands in South America.
   Its life history is poorly known and here we provide novel information
   on several aspects of its breeding biology, including territoriality and
   habitat use. We investigated it at Aguas Emendadas Ecological Station,
   Federal District, Brazil, between 2002 and 2009. Banded E. herbicola had
   an average territory size of 3.9 ha (n = 6). Twenty nests were monitored
   every 2-4 days, of which 18 were active. The reproductive period
   occurred from October to March, but eggs were laid from early October to
   mid-November, with a peak in late October. Nests were built close to the
   ground and (mean height = 14.8 +/- 9.0 cm, n = 17) clutch size was
   invariably two but ranged from one to three eggs (mean = 2 +/- 0.4, n =
   15). Incubation period was 14.8 +/- 0.8 days (n = 2) and nestling period
   was 11 +/- 0.6 days (n = 4). Most nests (n = 12) were built in open
   cerrado vegetation. Among the 18 active nests, 44.4\% were successful,
   38.9\% were depredated and 16.7\% were abandoned. Predation rate during
   the nestling period (85.7\%) was significantly higher than during the
   incubation period (14.3\%). Mayfield nest success rate was 42\%, with a
   much higher survival rate during the egg period (0.881 +/- 0.112) than
   during the nestling period (0.476 +/- 0.147). Most nests (n = 12) were
   built in open cerrado vegetation, which may be considered the most
   important habitat for the species both for territory defense and
   nesting.},

Title = {Explaining the persistence of low income and environmentally degrading
   land uses in the Brazilian Amazon},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {22},
Number = {3},
Abstract = {Tropical forests continue to be plagued by the dual sustainability
   challenges of deforestation and rural poverty. We seek to understand why
   many of the farmers living in the Brazilian Amazon, home to the world's
   largest tropical agricultural-forest frontier, persist in agricultural
   activities associated with low incomes and high environmental damage. To
   answer this question, we assess the factors that shape the development
   and distribution of agricultural activities and farmer well-being in
   these frontiers. Our study utilizes a uniquely comprehensive
   social-ecological dataset from two regions in the eastern Brazilian
   Amazon and employs a novel conceptual framework that highlights the
   interdependencies between household attributes, agricultural activities,
   and well-being. We find that livestock production, which yields the
   lowest per hectare incomes, remains the most prevalent land use in
   remote areas, but many examples of high income fruit, horticulture, and
   staple crop production exist on small properties, particularly in
   peri-urban areas. The transition to more profitable land uses is limited
   by lagging supply chain infrastructure, social preferences, and the fact
   that income associated with land use activities is not a primary source
   of perceived life quality. Instead subjective well-being is more heavily
   influenced by the nonmonetary attributes of a rural lifestyle (safety,
   tranquility, community relations, etc.). We conclude that transitions
   away from low-income land uses in agricultural-forest frontiers of the
   Brazilian Amazon need not abandon a land-focused vision of development,
   but will require policies and programs that identify and discriminate
   households based on a broader set of household assets, cultural
   attributes, and aspirations than are traditionally applied. At a broader
   scale, access to distant markets for high value crops must be improved
   via investments in processing, storage, and marketing infrastructure.},

Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {15},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {This study investigated the impact of regional land abandonment in
   northeast Portugal. It specifically focused on carbon sequestration
   opportunities in the Upper Sabor River Watershed, situated in the
   northeast of Portugal, amidst agricultural land abandonment. The study
   involved mapping the distribution of soil organic carbon (SOC) across
   four soil layers (0-5 cm, 5-10 cm, 10-20 cm, and 20-30 cm) at 120
   sampling points. The quantification of SOC storage (measured in Mg C
   ha(-1)) allowed for an analysis of its relationship with various
   landscape characteristics, including elevation, land use and land cover
   (LULC), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), modified
   soil-adjusted vegetation index (MSAVI), topographic wetness index (TWI),
   and erosion risk (ER). Six statistical tests were employed, including
   multivariate approaches like Cubist and Random Forest, within different
   scenarios to assess carbon distribution within the watershed's soils.
   These modeling results were then utilized to propose strategies aimed at
   enhancing soil carbon storage. Notably, a significant discrepancy was
   observed in the carbon content between areas at higher elevations (>1000
   m) and those at lower elevations (<800 m). Additionally, the study found
   that the amount of carbon stored in agricultural soils was often
   significantly lower than in other land use categories, including
   forests, mountain herbaceous vegetation, pasture, and shrub communities.
   Analyzing bi- and multivariate scenarios, it was determined that the
   scenario with the greatest number of independent variables (set 6)
   yielded the lowest RMSE (root mean squared error), serving as a key
   indicator for evaluating predicted values against observed values.
   However, it is important to note that the independent variables used in
   set 4 (elevation, LULC, and NDVI) had reasonably similar values.

Title = {Phylogenetic community structure as an ecological indicator of
   anthropogenic disturbance for endemic lizards in a biodiversity hotspot},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {103},
Pages = {766-773},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The expansion of human-altered landscapes affects biodiversity on every
   continent. In the Cerrado biodiversity hotspot of central Brazil,
   Eucalyptus plantations increasingly claim large tracts of native
   habitats thanks to favorable soils, climate and booming pulp firm
   profits. Yet, the highs and lows of the economy including government
   incentives over the years riddled the landscape with abandoned
   plantations, which are not subject to active restoration. Despite the
   well-documented pattern anthropogenic disturbances negatively affect
   Cerrado biodiversity, little is known about the processes driving
   species co-existence within these abandoned plantations.
   Herein, we use phylogenetic community structure indices to test if
   potential processes assembling lizard communities differ between
   undisturbed Cerrado habitats and disturbed abandoned Eucalyptus
   plantations; and if so, are these processes predictable. In addition, we
   explore the applicability of phylogenetic community structure indices as
   ecological indicators of anthropogenic disturbance in the Cerrado
   biodiversity hotspot.
   We address these questions at a local scale, recording lizard species
   richness and abundance along transects of undisturbed Cerrado and
   adjacent disturbed abandoned Eucalyptus plantations. Morphological
   measurements were collected from captured lizards to test for trait
   conservatism. We investigated if phylogenetic community structure is
   altered in a predictable manner by comparing (i) phylogenetic species
   variability, (ii) phylogenetic species richness and (iii) phylogenetic
   species evenness. To test for significant differences between
   undisturbed and disturbed communities, we performed two-tailed paired
   t-tests for each phylogenetic community index. We also test for
   phylogenetic clustering and overdispersion to determine if potential
   processes assembling lizard communities differ between undisturbed and
   disturbed communities. Furthermore, we compare phylogenetic community
   structure indices to other commonly used diversity indices (taxonomic,
   functional and phylogenetic diversity) to evaluate their applicability
   as ecological indicators of anthropogenic disturbance in the Cerrado.
   We demonstrated phylogenetic clustering in two out of three of the
   undisturbed Cerrado lizard communities supporting habitat filtering as
   the potential dominant assembly process; whereas 67\% of the disturbed
   Eucalyptus communities showed phylogenetic overdispersion supporting
   competition as the potential predominate assembly process. This
   indicates anthropogenic disturbance, in the form of abandoned Eucalyptus
   plantations, may alter phylogenetic community structure in a predictable
   manner, leading to the loss of closely related species in the disturbed
   plantation forests. The highly endemic biota of the Cerrado is composed
   of closely related species that share similar traits for survival, most
   likely a consequence of frequent episodic fires during the dry season.
   Interestingly, phylogenetic community structure indices and diversity
   indices did not converge on the same disturbed site to prioritize for
   active restoration; thereby, providing a cautionary tale on the
   applicability of the indices as ecological indicators for the Cerrado
   biodiversity.},

Abstract = {Since 1993, an agro-forestry pasture system has been annually implanted
   in Paracatu, Minas Gerais State. So, the effects from its introduction
   upon the changes in carbon and nitrogen at different compartments of the
   soil organic matter were studied. This system is implanted in soil under
   eucalypt forest that was abandoned after three removal cuts. In the
   first year, besides planting the eucalyptuses in interlines at spacing
   10 x 4 m, the following crops are grown: rice in the first year; soybean
   in the second one; and the brachiaria in the third one. After the third
   year, the brachiaria pasture by meat cattle was begun and remaining in
   that area until the end of the system cycle, what is foreseen for the
   11th year. A savannah area and another one with eucalypt planting under
   the conventional system were used as reference to natural condition and
   previous conditions to implantation of the agrosylvopasture system.
   Samples aged 1, 2, 3, 6, and 10 years were collected. The results show
   significant decrease in the contents and stocks of both total carbon and
   nitrogen, as well as in microbial biomass. As the system becomes older,
   it starts a tendency for the recuperation of the contents and stocks of
   those fractions. Among the humic substances, the fulvic acid fraction
   was less affected by the introduction of this system. Briefly, the
   results show the system is unfavorable to the maintenance of the soil
   organic matter at the first years, but presents a potential for
   recovering as its age advances.},

Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {485},
Pages = {110-120},
Month = {JUL 1},
Abstract = {Soil losses were calculated in a rural watershed where environmental
   land use conflicts developed in the course of a progressive invasion of
   forest and pasture/forest lands by agriculture, especially vineyards.
   The hydrographic basin is located in the Douro region where the famous
   Port wine is produced (northern Portugal) and the soil losses were
   estimated by the Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE) in combination with
   a Geographic Information System (GIS). Environmental land use conflicts
   were set up on the basis of land use and land capability maps, coded as
   follows: 1-agriculture, 2-pasture, 3-pasture/forest, and 4-forest. The
   difference between the codes of capability and use defines a conflict
   class, where a negative or nil value means no conflict and a positive i
   value means class i conflict. The reliability of soil loss estimates was
   tested by a check of these values against the frequency of stone wall
   instabilities in vineyard terraces, with good results. Using the USLE,
   the average soil loss (A) was estimated in A = 12.2 t . ha(-1) . yr(-1)
   and potential erosion risk areas were found to occupy 28.3\% of the
   basin, defined where soil losses are larger than soil loss tolerances.
   Soil losses in no conflict regions (11.2 t . ha(-1) . yr(-1)) were
   significantly different from those in class 2 (6.8 t . ha(-1) . yr(-1))
   and class 3 regions (21.3 t . ha(-1) . yr(-1)) that in total occupy 2.62
   km(2) (143\% of the basin). When simulating a scenario of no conflict
   across the entire basin, whereby land use in class 2 conflict regions is
   set up to permanent pastures and in class 3 conflict regions to pine
   forests, it was concluded that A = 0.95 t . ha(-1) . yr(-1) (class 2) or
   A = 9.8 t . ha(-1) . yr(-1) (class 3), which correspond to drops of 86\%
   and 54\% in soil loss relative to the actual values. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Abstract = {Earth observation images are a powerful source of data about changes in
   our planet. Given the magnitude of global environmental changes taking
   place, it is important that Earth Science researchers have access to
   spatiotemporal reasoning tools. One area of particular interest is
   land-use change. Using data obtained from images, researchers would like
   to express abstractions such as land abandonment', forest regrowth', and
   agricultural intensification'. These abstractions are specific types of
   land-use trajectories, defined as multi-year paths from one land cover
   into another. Given this need, this paper introduces a spatiotemporal
   calculus for reasoning about land-use trajectories. Using Allen's
   interval logic as a basis, we introduce new predicates that express
   cases of recurrence, conversion and evolution in land-use change. The
   proposed predicates are sufficient and necessary to express different
   kinds of land-use trajectories. Users can build expressions that
   describe how humans modify Earth's terrestrial surface. In this way,
   scientists can better understand the environmental and economic effects
   of land-use change.},

Abstract = {The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of succession stages
   of regeneration of the Brazilian savanna (Cerrado) on the richness,
   diversity, trophic guilds, and community composition of ants looking for
   taxonomic and functional changes in the community. The areas included an
   active pasture that had been created within the past six months, areas
   with several years of abandonment with different degrees of natural
   Brazilian savanna regeneration (from 2 to 15 years), and two large
   remnants of native forest that had been preserved for at least 40 years.
   Collections were carried out in 56 plots using sardine baits and an
   active search for a period of one hour in each plot. In addition to
   calculating the regeneration age, we evaluated successional stages by
   measuring vegetal characteristics in each plot. A total of 60 species
   was obtained, distributed in 28 genera and 8 subfamilies, and these
   demonstrated a direct association with the regeneration age of the
   areas, as well as their richness and diversity of ants. Areas with
   initial regeneration showed a greater proportion of generalist species
   and, as plant succession increased, generalist species decreased. A
   temporal threshold of 5-6 years for regeneration age was observed, when
   the community structure tended to stabilize. We observed that the
   maintenance of a minimum quantity of vegetation in areas destined for
   livestock can efficiently preserve ant diversity.},

Abstract = {Aim We aimed to evaluate the performance of native tree species in the
   restoration of savanna vegetation by direct seeding, to assess whether
   weed control and intercropping with native grasses can contribute to the
   success of this method and to determine whether species performance can
   be explained by functional traits.
   Location Cerrado biome, southeastern Brazil. Old fields abandoned after
   decades of land use as pasture or croplands, occupied by ruderal plants
   and invasive grasses.
   Methods We established a direct seeding experiment with ten tree species
   native to the cerrado (Brazilian savanna) region. We used a factorial
   design in five blocks, with the following factors: (a) species; (b) weed
   control and (c) intercropping with native grasses. We evaluated the
   emergence, survival and growth of plants, and through multiple
   regressions we sought to explain the success of the species in direct
   seeding based on their functional traits.
   Results Emergence and survival in the field varied widely among species
   but with little or no difference between treatments. Growth was
   compromised by weed competition in all species. Intercropping with
   native grasses did not decrease weed competition. We found a functional
   pattern associated with species performance in direct seeding, where
   survival in the field is positively associated with seed mass, root
   depth and a greater root:shoot ratio.
   Conclusion Weed competition impairs seedling growth more than survival,
   considerably delaying restoration by direct seeding. The success of this
   method in the savanna will depend on the use of species that are best
   adapted to environments where water stress is the main obstacle to
   overcome and have large seeds and seedlings with a large and deep root
   system. Characterizing underground seedling systems is essential for
   predicting the success of cerrado species in direct seeding.},

Abstract = {AimsTo address whether seed and seedling functional traits have a
   significant effect on germination rates and seedling survival in
   direct-seeding restoration efforts. We tested the hypotheses that: (1)
   seed burial only favours the emergence of round seeds; and (2) straw
   mulching improves soil moisture and prevents the emergence of the
   invasive grass Urochloa decumbens, promoting the establishment of native
   tree seedlings.
   LocationExperimental field, Central Brazil. Savanna, recently dominated
   by exotic pasture.
   MethodsWe evaluated the effects of seed burial (surface and buried) and
   mulching (no-mulch, 5-cm straw mulch and 10-cm straw mulch) on the
   emergence, survival and growth of 16 species of native Cerrado tree
   species with variable seed sizes and shapes and seedling types. Thirty
   seeds of each species were sown per treatment combination in three
   blocks.
   ResultsSeed burial did not affect the emergence of species with round
   seeds, but negatively affected species with flat seeds and
   phanerocotylar-epigeal-foliaceous seedlings. Straw mulching reduced the
   emergence of flat seeds and phanerocotylar seedlings, but increased soil
   moisture and strongly reduced U.decumbens emergence, resulting in a
   higher growth rate of tree seedlings up to 1yr for five species.
   ConclusionDirect seeding is an effective technique to plant a mixture of
   Cerrado tree species for restoration, provided the soil is well prepared

Abstract = {Cocoa is a crop grown largely by smallholder farmers in the lowland
   tropics, including parts of Latin America, West Africa, and Indonesia.
   Research suggests that it has the potential to provide biodiversity
   benefits when grown under certain shade conditions, especially when
   compared with alternative land uses. The primary literature on cocoa
   production reveals a range of objectives for improvement of cocoa
   production on small farms. These objectives are sometimes in direct
   opposition to each other, for example, increasing productivity through
   shade removal and chemical inputs, and the desire to increase
   biodiversity benefits. These opposing goals demonstrate some real
   trade-offs faced by cocoa producers. We summarize the current
   literature, drawing attention to some of these trade-offs and
   highlighting important ecological, economic, and social considerations.
   In considering strategies for ameliorating these negative tradeoffs, we
   make two primary policy recommendations. First, we suggest that outreach
   focusing on farm diversification may be the most effective way of
   optimizing ecological, economic, and social outcomes. Farm
   diversification may provide an effective means of achieving improved
   farmer security and dissuade farmers from abandoning or planting cocoa
   according to price fluctuations, thus reducing the use of new forest
   areas in cocoa production. Secondly, we suggest greater focus on
   determining effective economic incentives for maintaining shade in cocoa
   production. For example, price premiums associated high quality
   shade-grown cocoa may increase economic benefits while simultaneously
   providing incentives to farmers to maintain shade in production. Lastly,
   we identify some important areas of research for further informing
   policy in this arena.},

Abstract = {Ctenus medius Keyserling, 1891 is a wandering spider common in the
   Brazilian Atlantic Forest. It has been the subject of few studies. Thus,
   this work aims to elucidate aspects of its natural history, such as the
   life cycle and reproductive behavior of this species, through laboratory
   and field observations. Two females with egg sacs were observed in the
   laboratory and one was observed in field (Barra Mansa, 22 degrees 32'S
   and 44 degrees 10'W) until the emergence of the spiderlings. For
   observation of the immature stage development, a portion of the
   spiderlings from the same hatch were taken to the laboratory and watched
   until sexual maturity. In the field, the period between the oviposition
   and the emergence of spiderlings was of 36 days. The female selects a
   site for egg sac deposition and stays there until the spiderlings
   emerge. Seven days after the emergence, the female abandoned the site
   where the egg sac was made, concomitant to the spiderlings dispersion
   from observation's place and until the moment that the spiderlings
   started to eat. For the spiderlings kept under laboratory conditions,
   cannibalism was not observed in the first instars (1-4th) when
   sufficient food was offered. Sexual maturity happened in the 14th or
   15th instars, with an average of 309.2 to 344.5 days until the
   last/sexual molt, respectively. Until the date of sexual maturity, there
   was a mortality rate of 85\%. This species is very fragile in captivity.
   This hampered deductions concerning longevity. Both females and males
   collected in the field were induced to mate in the laboratory. Courtship
   movements of males were registered, but the females did not permit the
   mating. These data may assist in initial biological studies of Ctenus
   genus and offer comparative parameters for studies of other related
   species.},

   detection in a cluttered environment using videos acquired with a moving

   proposed for comparing two videos (an anomaly-free reference video and a
   target one possibly with anomalies) by using convolutional neural
   networks as feature extractors for a subsequent anomaly-detection stage
   using a classifier. Two classifier strategies are considered, namely a
   fully-connected neural network and a random forest algorithm. Results
   for a comprehensive abandoned object database acquired with a moving

Abstract = {During a 66-day period, a study was made in controlled environment
   chambers, under high (800-1000 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) and low (200-350 mu
   mol m(-2) s(-1)) light regimes on the physiology, morphology and growth
   of Solanum crinitum, a pioneer medium-sized woody species known to
   invade forest gaps, active pastures and abandoned agricultural areas in
   the Brazilian Amazonia. The objective was to investigate the sun-shade
   acclimation characteristics of this species. High-light grown plants
   (HL) had higher light saturated rates of photosynthesis than low-light
   plants (LL). No significant difference in dark respiration was observed
   between light regimes. Relative growth rate was initially (at 22 d)
   higher for HL, becoming similar between treatments in the last two
   harvests (44 and 66 d). Leaf area ratio and specific leaf area were
   higher for LL. Allocation of biomass to leaves was similar between
   treatments, while biomass allocated to roots was higher in HL.
   Allocation of biomass to stems was higher in LL. Leaves grown under high
   irradiance had less nitrogen per unit of mass and more per unit of area
   than leaves developed at low irradiance. These results suggest that
   light is important to the performance of this species and that the
   differential responses to light conditions may contribute to or detract
   from its ability to succeed in natural and agricultural environments or
   to endure control strategies.},

Abstract = {The effect of the introduction of an agrosylvopasture (SASP) system on
   the changes in the carbon (C) of the soil and its lability were studied.
   Since 1993, this system has been annually implanted in Paracatu, MG. It
   was planted under eucalyptus forest abandoned after three cuts, when the
   brachiaria grass was established. The eucalyptususes were planted at 10
   x 4 m spacing, and the following crops have been grown between the
   lines: rice in the first year, soybean in the second, and brachiaria in
   the third. After the third year, pasture of the meat cattle begins on
   brachiaria and remains until the end of the system cycle that was
   foreseen for the 11th year. A savannah area and another one with
   eucalyptusus under a conventional system were used as references to
   natural condition and the way the area is used before plantation of the
   SASP, respectively. Some samples aged 1, 21 3, 6, and 10 years were
   collected in SASP. According to the obtained results, the following
   conclusions were drawn: (i) the C contents and stocks were affected
   before and during the plantation of the SASP by the use and management
   of SASP, as they were reduced in the first years of the system
   establishment but improved at the 10th year; (ii) the C from the
   particulate free light fraction (CFLLP) that was extracted by potassium
   pertriangate (KMnO4) was sensitive to the use and management, and so
   reflected the changes in total organic C (TOC); (iii) the more labile
   fractions of C that were extracted at different concentrations of
   sulfuric acid (H2SO4) satisfactorily reflected the changes in both use
   and management, whereas the less labile fractions were just slightly
   affected; and (iv) the C management index (IMC) calculated from CFLLP
   was the most sensitive to the changes in use and management. However,
   when calculated from the C fraction I extracted by 3M H2SO4 (C-F1), it
   showed better reliability.},

Abstract = {The increasing anthropogenic pressure in the rare rupestrian fields in
   southeastern Brazil has led to the expansion of degraded areas on the
   extremely nutrient-deficient quartzitic soils. on the other hand, the
   use of rupestrian field native species in reclamation programmes has
   been hampered by the lack of studies involving seedling physiological
   ecology. The present study evaluated biomass allocation and seedling
   growth rate during early seedling growth of four Fabaceae shrubs:
   Collaea cipoensis, Calliandra fasciculata, Chamaecrista ramosa, and
   Mimosa foliolosa. The following hypotheses were tested: (i) species
   proportionally allocate higher biomass to the roots, presenting a high
   root/shoot ratio; and (ii) species exhibit low phenotypic variation
   because they have adapted to poor nutritional environments. A 12-month
   greenhouse experiment was carried out to evaluate seedling growth and
   biomass allocation performance in substrates with contrasting levels of
   soil fertility, The four species studied presented values of root/shoot
   ratio lower than one in both fertility conditions of the substrate.
   Growth parameters for Collaea and Calliandra increased with increasing
   soil fertility, while no differences were observed for Mimosa and
   Chamaecrista. Although the four species are naturally adapted to low
   nutritional quality soils, seedling development was not hindered by high
   fertility substrate conditions. Despite the remarkable differences in
   fertility between the substrates, the responsiveness in growth and
   allocation in Chamaecrista and Mimosa was lower than that expected if
   the species would exhibit high phenotypic variation. The implications
   for rupestrian field restoration are discussed. (C) 2008 Elsevier Masson

Abstract = {1 Management of vegetational diversity in agroecosystems is a
   potentially regulating factor of pest population dynamics and may affect
   developmental stages in different ways.
   2 We investigated the population dynamics of red spider mites, coffee
   leaf miners, and coffee berry borers in three management types of coffee
   agroforests: increasing plant diversity from a few shade tree species
   (simple-shade agroforests), intermediate-shade tree species
   (complex-shade agroforests) to high-shade tree species (abandoned coffee
   agroforests) in Ecuador. Furthermore, we studied how changes in
   agroforestry management affect population stage structure of each coffee
   pest.
   3 Our results show that agroforestry management affected seasonal
   patterns of coffee pests in that higher densities of red spider mites
   were observed from August to December, coffee leaf miners from December
   to February, and coffee berry borers from May to July. Moreover,
   specific developmental stages of red spider mites, coffee leaf miners,
   and coffee berry borers differed in their responses to agroforestry
   management. During all stages, red spider mite reached higher densities
   in simple-shade agroforests compared with complex-shade and abandoned
   agroforests. Meanwhile, coffee leaf miner densities decreased from
   simple-shade to complex-shade and abandoned agroforests, but only for
   larvae, not pupae. Similarly, only coffee berry borer adults (but not
   eggs, larvae and pupae) demonstrated a response to agroforestry
   management. Environmental variables characterizing each agroforestry
   type proved to be important drivers of pest population densities in the
   field.
   4 We emphasize the importance of considering seasonal differences and
   population structure while investigating arthropod responses to
   different habitat types because responses change with time and

   under the scenario of climate change for Mediterranean areas. A survey
   to examine the pattern of soil erosion and sedimentation was carried out
   along a climatic and altitudinal transect extending from the centre of
   the basin to the northern divide in the Pyrenees. Soil redistribution
   rates were assessed by using fallout (CS)-C-137 measurements on
   representative areas that are presented as case studies. The central
   steppe is the most severely affected by erosion, as indicated by highly
   depleted Cs-137 levels. In the semiarid area, erosion mainly affects the
   slopes that are sparsely vegetated and the cultivated valley floors. In
   the Pyrenees, soils on steep slopes are quite stable under dense shrub
   or forest cover. On the sparsely vegetated slopes of abandoned fields,
   erosion is severe, particularly on south facing slopes. These case
   studies emphasize both the spatial contrasts in soil redistribution
   rates that can be found in Mediterranean areas and the intense erosion
   and sedimentation dynamics that can threaten the sustainability of soil
   and water resources.},

Abstract = {Soils of the Brazilian Cerrado biome have been found to be deficient in
   copper (Cu) and zinc (Zn). In this area, an Oxisol was deeply excavated
   in 1962 during the construction of a hydroelectrical plant, and the
   exposed saprolite material was abandoned, without any reclamation
   measures. The abandoned land was a harsh environment for plant growth,
   and the secondary vegetation has not recovered. A field trial was
   established in 1992 to assess the effects of different grass species and
   lime amendments on soil reclamation at the degraded site. In 2011 soil
   samples were collected at three depths (0-10, 10-20, and 20-40cm) from
   vegetated and bare plots over tilled saprolite, from an untreated area
   of the saprolite, and from an Oxisol under native forest, used as
   external reference. Nineteen years after the reclamation effort was
   begun, the organic carbon (OC) content of the restored saprolite still
   was much lower than that of the Oxisol under natural vegetation. The
   undisturbed Oxisol was deficient in extractable Cu (0.16-0.10mgkg(-1))
   and Zn (0.10-0.02mgkg(-1)) and exhibited rather low concentrations of
   extractable iron (Fe; 5.24-1.47mgkg(-1)) and manganese (Mn;
   3.21-0.77mgkg(-1)). However, the saprolite under reclamation showed even
   lower levels of these elements compared to the native forest soil. In
   the natural soil, OC, N, extractable Fe, Mn, and Cu showed
   stratification, but this was not the case for extractable Zn. Although
   the reclaimed saprolite still was far from predisturbance conditions,
   the revegetation treatments promoted recovery of OC, N, Fe, Mn, and Cu
   at the surface layers, which resulted in incipient stratification.
   Extractable Fe, Mn, and Cu were correlated to OC, whereas no association
   between Zn and OC was detected. Our results also suggest that
   reclamation of the excavated saprolite may be constrained by
   micronutrient deficiencies and mostly by the extremely low levels of Zn
   and Cu.},

Abstract = {In nest-building species, offspring survival and reproductive success of
   parental individuals are strongly influenced by nest quality. Thus,
   quantifying the influence of abiotic conditions on nest integrity is
   important to predict the effects of weather variability on the fitness
   of parental individuals. Here, we investigated how rainfall affects nest
   integrity and how nest integrity influences males' attractiveness and
   nest tenure. Our study species was the harvestman Quindina limbata, in
   which males build mud nests on fallen logs and protect the eggs against
   predators and fungi. Our data set comprises 12 months of regular
   inspections of 149 nests in a Costa Rican rainforest. We found that
   almost 50\% of the nests were destroyed by rainfall. The drag force
   caused by rainfall running on the fallen log surface negatively affected
   nest integrity. Fungi cover on nests was influenced by an interaction
   between rainfall and nest position on the fallen log. Irrespective of
   their body size, males in nests with high integrity received more eggs
   than males in nests with low integrity. Fungi cover did not influence
   the number of eggs received by the males. Finally, nest integrity and
   fungi cover did not affect nest tenure, but males that did not receive
   eggs for a long time tended to abandon their nests. Considering that
   intense rainfall occurs all year long in tropical forests, males should
   build their nests in protected sites that preserve nest structure.
   Protected sites may keep nest structure better preserved, improve
   offspring survival, attract more females, and increase males'
   reproductive success.},

Abstract = {American cutaneous leishmaniasis has shown an endemic character in areas
   of North-North-west Parana State, which were populated in 40's, where
   residual forests persist with intense modifications.  The infection has
   been found mainly in males, but was found also in females and children
   and in many individuals of a same family.  513 cases of cutaneous
   leishmaniasis notified to SUCAM by clinical diagnosis were investigated.
   Treatment was begun with Glucantime(R) at State Health Centers or at
   SUCAM.  Of 513 treated patients 260 (50.67\%) were considered clinically
   cured.  The remaining 253 (49.33\%) abandoned treatment.  The quantity
   of Glucantime(R) supplied to the patients varied from 10 vials to more
   than 200, with or without intervals during the treatment.  Two hundred
   and seventeen (85.46\%) patients among 260 received from 10 to 75 vials.
   The ocurrence  of leishmaniasis in 163 (31.75\%) women and in 34
   (6.62\%) children, of both sexes, up to 10 years old, suggests
   domiciliary transmission.  It's not known if the 253 (49.33\%)
   individuals who abandoned the treatment recovered.  This high number
   shows the necessity of better knowledge of the consequences that can
   occur due to incomplete treatment.},

Journal = {SCIENTIA AGRICOLA},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {67},
Number = {2},
Pages = {244-250},
Abstract = {Ecological theories of facilitation and nucleation are proposed as a
   basis for environmental restoration in tropical ecosystems. The main
   goal of this paper is to present restoration techniques based on the
   concept of nucleation, in which small nuclei of vegetation are
   established within a degraded land. The nucleation techniques
   (artificial shelters for animals, planting of herbaceous shrub life
   forms, soil and seed bank translocation, seed rain translocation, soil
   and seed rain translocation's seedling set, artificial perches, planting
   of native trees in groups, and ecological stepping-stones with
   functional groups) promote the landscape connectivity on two flows:
   inward: receiver connectivity and outward: donor connectivity. The
   nuclei development represents an alternative for restoration by
   prioritizing the natural processes of succession. This methodology
   appears to take long to generate vegetation corresponding to tropical
   climates, but is fundamental in the formation of communities capable of
   acting, in the future, as a new functional nuclei within the current
   fragmented landscape. This strategy also encourages greater integration
   between the theories and projects of ecological restoration for the
   development of human resources and to benefit the restoration

Abstract = {Species loss leads to changes in ecosystem function and services,
   impacting human well-being. Although biodiversity restoration is pivotal
   to circumvent this situation, the techniques for restoring old-growth
   savannas are still limited and the restoration outcomes remain
   unpredictable. Here, we use a trait-based approach to understand the
   functional outcomes of ecological restoration via direct seeding in a
   Brazilian savanna (cerrado, hereafter neotropical savanna). We compared
   the functional composition from woody and non-woody component, total
   biomass, and biomass allocation of a restored relative to a degraded
   savanna (abandoned pasture) dominated by exotic grasses and a
   well-preserved old-growth native savanna. We found that the functional
   composition of restored communities was very similar to those dominated
   by exotic grasses, both characterized by a greater dominance of species
   with acquisitive traits, higher above-ground biomass, and lower
   investment in root biomass. In contrast, the native vegetation exhibited
   a dominance of conservative traits and higher investment in belowground
   rather than aboveground biomass. Even though the acquisitive traits in
   the restored savanna allow a fast aboveground biomass accumulation and
   soil cover, the lower belowground biomass investment in the restored
   savanna may limit its resistance and resilience to droughts and fires.
   Our findings suggest that restoration efforts in neotropical savanna
   should focus on fostering the establishment of slow-growing species to
   recover the ecosystem properties provided by the high biodiversity in
   neotropical savannas.},

Abstract = {Grazing by large herbivorous mammals is still a structuring force in
   tropical grassy ecosystems, and cattle grazing is one of the main
   economic activities carried out in these ecosystems in modern times.
   Therefore, understanding the impacts of cattle grazing removal on
   biodiversity may be a key step for conservation of this ecosystem. Here,
   we studied the successional trajectory of dung beetle communities in a
   tropical grassy ecosystem after cattle removal. For this, we assessed
   the patterns of dung beetle taxonomic and functional diversity of 14
   natural grasslands with distinct cattle grazing removal ages (from 3
   months to 22 years) along a chronosequence, applying the space-for-time
   substitution method. Our results show a strong decrease in dung beetle
   abundance (93 times) and species richness (6 times) in the first ten
   years of cattle removal. However, after ten years there is an increase
   in dung beetle abundance (73 times) and species richness (5 times).
   Taxonomic composition was also influenced by cattle removal time
   demonstrating the importance of cattle in the structuring of dung beetle
   communities in natural grasslands. In contrast, functional composition
   and diversity were not affected by cattle grazing removal, indicating
   these metrics are less sensitive to cattle absence than taxonomic
   diversity and composition. Our results provide evidence that cattle
   grazing removal, at least in the short term (10 years), may be an
   inefficient management tool for restoration and conservation of tropical
   grassy ecosystems. However, we highlight the need to investigate the
   reintroduction of cattle grazing after different removal times to
   provide complimentary information to livestock management able to
   integrate human use and conservation of tropical grassy ecosystems.},

Abstract = {Amphibious habits are present in a variety of fish and are allowed by a
   set of physiological, morphological and behavioural adaptations. The
   most intriguing question, however, is what motivates an aquatic organism
   to venture into the land? Unfavourable abiotic and biotic conditions in
   the aquatic environment have been reported as main stimuli for fish to
   emerge from water. However, few attempts have been made to disentangle
   the effects of different social contexts on the propensity of amphibious
   fishes to leave the water. Trying to separate the effects of predator
   threat, intraspecific competition and mate searching on overland
   movement of amphibious fish, we ran a mesocosm experiment with the
   Amazonian killifish Anablepsoides micropus. Overland movement was
   quantified based on fish leaps between artificial pools set in
   enclosures in a primary forest area. Males moved overland more
   frequently than females and their movement depended on the social
   context, being higher in the presence of predators and lower in the
   presence of females. Females, instead, showed context-independent
   movement rates. This suggests that males move between pools searching
   for mates, stopping when successful in this search. On the other hand,
   occasional encounters with predators may force males to abandon the pool
   as a defence mechanism. Female aggressiveness towards the predator may
   influence its low movement in the presence of the predator. Such
   differential responses may play important ecological and evolutionary
   roles, allowing A. micropus to occupy a wide range of environmental
   conditions under varied ecological and social contexts.},

   beetles in promoting ant nest cavities mediated by a twig-girdler
   engineer. We collected 120 abandoned branches that had been detached by
   0. albomarginata chamela, in a tropical dry forest, in Jalisco, Mexico,
   Sixty abandoned branches were placed in trees from February to April,
   and another sixty from August to October 2016, In order to test the
   effects of nest characteristics on ant species, we measured the diameter
   of each branch and the diameter of the ant nest entrance as explanatory
   variables, whereas the size of ant species was used as response
   variable. We found 49 nests of arboreal ants from 14 species. The body
   size of the ants nesting in the abandoned branches was positively
   correlated with the diameter of the nest entrance. Ants used abandoned
   branches mainly as polydomic nests. Our result confirms that ants
   partitioning resources according to the size of entrance holes made by
   wood-boring beetles in dead wood. Polydomic nests have been reported as
   a strategy to promote the colonization of new nesting sites and the
   reduction of intraspecific competition. We conclude that the ecosystem
   engineering carried out by the twig-girdler 0. albomarginata chamela had
   extended effects on the arboreal ant community, that takes advantage of
   the cavities abandoned by wood-boring beetles for nesting, especially
   for polydomic nests. (C) 2017 Gesellschaft ftir Okologie. Published by

Abstract = {The article investigates the text Fita Verde no Cabelo, by Guimaraes
   Rosa, and reflects on the formation of the narrative space as a
   construction rich in significant components for understanding the
   character's ripening process. The apprehension of the text as a language
   artifact is the basis for the maturing of other concepts such as
   imagination phenomenology, from Gaston Bachelard, and the psychoanalytic
   perspective that illuminate the text so as to reveal the methodological
   approach whereby the village is set primarily as an undefined space that
   drives and holds itself at the same time; secondly, the reflection falls
   on the forest as a place of the excessive; and lastly, the house is
   considered as a central space where the self, in the struggle with
   oneself and the space is consolidated by the experience of death. As a
   result of this reading, the passage from Little Red Riding Hood to Fita
   Verde no Cabelo as the replication of a starkness process suffered by
   the artistic language that parts from of its very externality, with all
   the hallmarks of a text concerned with what is being stated and that,
   therefore, calls for a complete reader, whole, definite; and goes in
   search of other possibilities of linguistic construction, seeking an
   inner space in the language, a word that has an experimental component
   in itself, where clashes are unavoidable and where the reader abandons
   any form of tranquility and begins to enjoy the incompleteness of living
   with the complexity inherent to contemporary reading.},

Abstract = {Nitrous oxide (N2O), which is a long-lived greenhouse gas and the chief
   source of nitric oxide (NO) in the stratosphere, is an important
   catalyst in deletion of the ozone shield. The largest known natural or
   anthropogenic contribution to current increasing levels of atmospheric
   nitrous oxide is from the humid tropics. This research reports the
   methodologies developed for monitoring N2O emissions from different
   humid tropical ecosystems over 2 years near Manaus, Brazil. Use of a
   double injection valve process for the chromatographic analysis of
   ambient levels of N2O eliminated the need for sample preparation and
   backflushing. The double injection valve process allows analysis of up
   to fifteen samples per hour for extended periods and provides excellent
   baseline stability and detector sensitivity. A closed, vented soil cover
   constructed of PVC pipe was used to monitor N2O emissions from humid
   tropical ecosystems. Dimensions of the soil cover affected estimates of
   N2O emissions from an abandoned pasture ecosystem. Flux estimates were
   highest when soil covers enclosed a minimum surface area of 300 cm(2)
   and a volume of 4 1. Storage of N2O samples (330, 915 and 1375 p.p.b.v.)
   in 125 ml glass serum bottles sealed with rubber septums for 48 hr had
   no effect on sample concentration, and samples retained 95\% of their
   original concentration after 450 hr of storage. These methodologies are
   offered as simple, inexpensive means of developing N2O monitoring
   programmes in tropical ecosystems.},

Abstract = {Giant otters (Pteronura brasiliensis) live in groups that seem to
   abandon their territories during the flooding season. We studied the
   spatial ecology of giant otter groups during dry and wet seasons in the
   Vermelho and Miranda rivers in the Brazilian Pantanal. We monitored
   visually or by radiotelemetry 10 giant otter groups monthly from June
   2009 to June 2011. We estimated home-range size for all groups with the
   following methods: linear river length, considering the extreme
   locations of each group, and fixed kernel. For the radiotracked groups,
   we also used the k-LoCoh method. Spatial fidelity and habitat selection
   of giant otter groups were analyzed seasonally. On the basis of k-LoCoh
   (98\%) method, home-range sizes during the wet season (3.6-7.9 km(2))
   were 4 to 59 times larger than during the dry season (0.1-2.3 km(2)).
   Home-range fidelity between seasons varied among giant otter groups from
   0\% to 87\%, and 2 radiotagged groups shifted to flooded areas during
   the wet seasons. Giant otter groups were selective in relation to the
   composition of the landscape available during the dry seasons, when the
   river was used more intensively than other landscape features. However,
   they seemed to be less selective in positioning activity ranges during
   the wet season. During this season, giant otters were frequently
   observed fishing in the areas adjacent to the river, such as flooded
   forest, grassland, and swamps.},

Abstract = {The assessment of carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) in
   agro-ecosystems of West African savannas (WAS) may be a useful tool to
   define sustainable intensification schemes needed to respond to the
   rapid increase in local populations as well as global change issues.
   Changes in soil properties, and particularly in the soil organic matter
   status, under semi-permanent cultivation were thus examined through a
   groundnut crop-fallow chronosequence in southern Senegal. The effect of
   fallowing was mainly restricted to the 0-20 cm soil layer and hardly
   affected soil physical properties. In this layer, steady improvements
   were recorded for Mg and Ca contents. Carbon and N amounts increased by
   30\%, and by 50\% for available P (POD) within the very first year of
   fallow and then remained steady (C and N) or dropped back to levels
   recorded for crops (POD). The rapid initial change in organic status
   after crop abandonment was attributed to fast recovery of woody
   vegetation. The steady soil organic matter (SOM) content in oldest
   fallows compared to young fallows probably resulted from poor protection
   of soil organic matter from oxidation during biological activity. This
   hypothesis was confirmed by mesh-bag experiments, which indicated that
   >40-60\% of decaying woody root biomass disappeared after 6 months of in
   situ incubation. In fallow systems in southern Senegal, soil fertility
   may in fact rely at least as much on fast organic matter cycling in soil
   food webs as on SOM build-up. Carbon storage in the soil-plant system of
   mature fallow ecosystems was only 27 t C ha(-1) higher than in crops and
   consisted mainly of pools with fast turnover. Consequently, the
   potential of semi-permanent cultivation for C sequestration in the WAS
   will be rather indirect, by a shift to more intensified practices, thus
   avoiding the conversion of dense forests to cropping in more humid
   areas. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Effective global agricultural land management is crucial for ensuring
   food security amidst rapid population growth, especially in Northern
   China's semi-arid and desert regions, where uncontrolled fallowing has
   led to increased cropland abandonment. Traditional remote sensing
   methods often face accuracy challenges in these harsh climatic
   conditions. This study introduces a novel approach to enhance the
   Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) by reconstructing the
   magnitude image using ground-truth samples and regional-scale Vegetation
   Health Index (VHI) data. This allows for flexible, pixel-level parameter
   assignment to detect cropland transitions more accurately. Rather than
   relying on single-value assessments to differentiate between active and
   inactive croplands, we employ pixel-wise magnitude images, integrated
   into the LandTrendr algorithm for trajectory-based change detection, to
   better address the variability of large, diverse agricultural regions.
   Tested on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform in Inner Mongolia-a
   representative arid and semi-arid region of Northern China-our method
   identified the year of cropland abandonment with 82.02 \% accuracy and
   showed a correlation (R2) of 0.6065 between observed and actual
   abandonment durations. This research extends the applicability of the
   LandTrendr algorithm, offering a robust solution for optimizing land use
   change detection across regions with significant climatic variation.},

   characterize the adjustments types and morphological changes occurred in
   the Sao Joao River between 1964 and 2018, based on rivers
   classification. The river system has a history of interventions that
   modified the original channels configuration in several sections,
   through the process of channel rectification and the construction of the
   Juturnaiba reservoir. In addition, there is a gradual and secular
   replacement of the natural vegetation of the Atlantic Forest by large
   cultivation and pastures areas. The identification of the types of
   rivers was based on the river styles frameworks that served as a basis
   for temporal comparison to identify the morphological adjustments of the
   channel. The adjustments were evaluated based on the erosive
   morphological evidences of the channel: abandoned channels, length of
   the meander curve, meander formation, lateral migration, meander curve
   rotation and meander curve translation. Eight river styles were
   identified, with the occurrence of adjustments evidence occurring in
   four river styles, located upstream of the Juturnaiba reservoir,
   predominantly in occupied areas by pastures. Evidences of channel
   adjustment was also observed in the biological reserve area, located
   close to the reservoir, however, the vegetation maintenance proved to be
   an important adjustments controller, considering that this section
   presents similar geomorphological conditions behavior in relation to the
   other areas with the channel adjustments.},

   causes of an announced development},
Journal = {LAND USE POLICY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {95},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Farmland abandonment is a widespread process with mixed socio-economic
   and environmental consequences. Farmland abandonment in Rio de Janeiro
   State is mainly instigated by the sugarcane industry crisis. The
   sugarcane crisis in Rio de Janeiro State affected traditional
   livelihoods and altered the environment and economy in the Norte
   Fluminense region (eastern part of Rio de Janeiro State). Therefore, it
   is essential to understand the underlying forces and contributory causes
   of farmland abandonment in Rio de Janeiro. We hypothesized that since
   the 1970s, macroeconomic and agricultural reforms mediated by economic
   shocks had driven the farmland abandonment in Rio de Janeiro State. We
   applied an interrupted time-series analysis over sugarcane harvest
   areas, relating the years of policy reforms and economic shocks to the
   trends in sugarcane harvest areas. The results suggest that the removal
   of agricultural subsidies, macroeconomic reforms, and elimination of the
   supply quota in the sugar mills have prompted competition and favored
   high-input agroindustry. Meanwhile, the labor force migration to the
   higher-paying oil Industry exacerbated the farmland abandonment rates
   for the smallholders of Rio de Janeiro State. This paper offers a
   valuable contribution to scientists and policymakers by providing an
   overview of the outcomes of the policies implemented and how they
   contributed to shaping the socio-economic dynamics in Rio de Janeiro
   State.},

Abstract = {Floristic changes in the Mediterranean region of central Chile brought
   about by human impact appear to be shared with other climatic regions,
   although there is a notable absence of empirical studies and available
   quantitative evidence for the central Chile region. This study examines
   the cover, richness and composition of native and exotic plant species
   in a representative area of central Chile. Through floristic
   characterization of 33 sites sampled using 40 x 40 m plots distributed
   along transect on which the two farthest sites were separated by 50 km,
   the floristic richness and cover patterns, as well as the general land
   use characteristics were evaluated (native matorral, espinal, abandoned
   farming field, forest plantations, periurban sites, road sites, river
   bank, and burnt site). We recorded 327 species of plants; 213 species
   were native and 114 were exotic. The average number of species was
   heterogeneous in all sites, showing a greater relative native frequency
   in those sites with a lower level of anthropic intervention. Except for
   the matorral, the cover of exotic species was greater than that of
   native species. No relation was found between richness and cover in
   relation to the different types of land use. The relationship between
   cover of native and exotic was negative, although for richness did not
   show relationship. Results show that the exotic species are limited by
   resources, although they have not completely displaced the native
   species. The native and exotic floras respond to different spatial
   distribution patterns, so their presence makes it possible to establish
   two facts rarely quantified in central Chile: first, that the exotic
   flora replaces (but does not necessarily displace) the native flora, and
   second, that at the same time, because of its greater geographic
   ubiquity and the abundance levels that it achieves, it contributes to
   the taxonomic and physiognomic homogenization of central Chile. (C) 2011

   qualitative study was undertaken in Manaus, capital of the state of
   Amazonas, Western Brazilian Amazon, using a sample of 33 patients who
   were being treated for malaria and 22 health agents who were working in
   malaria diagnosis, treatment and control at the local level. A
   semi-structured interview with a further thematic analysis was
   performed.ResultsThere are still many myths regarding malaria
   transmission and treatment that may hinder the sensitization of the
   population of this region in relation to the use of current control
   tools and elimination strategies, such as mass drug administration
   (MDA). Most health professionals reported that the abandonment of
   treatment for malaria by the patient is related to poor social
   conditions, the high incidence of alcoholism and the low level of
   schooling of the affected population. One negative perception, observed
   in both groups with regard to the use of insecticide-treated nets, is
   that they may cause skin irritations and allergies. Most patients and
   health professionals have described malaria as an impossible disease to
   eliminate because it is intrinsically associated with forest landscapes,
   and according to them, elimination would only be possible if there were
   a vaccine against malaria.ConclusionIn the Amazon, cultural perceptions
   about the etiology of this disease can influence the behaviour and
   practices that social groups adopt in relation to the different forms of
   living in a malaria-endemic context. Negative perceptions about malaria
   elimination can act as a barrier when trying to reach proper coverage
   for control strategies such as mosquito nets and MDA.},

Abstract = {In the malaria endemic municipality of Miraflores in southeastern
   Amazonian Colombia, several aspects of the biology of local Anopheles
   species were investigated to supplement the limited entomological
   surveillance information available and to provide baseline data for
   malaria prevention and vector control. Anopheles darlingi Root, 1926 was
   the most abundant species (95.6\%), followed by Anopheles braziliensis
   (Chagas) (3.6\%) and Anopheles oswaldoi s.l. (Peryassu) (0.7\%). During
   the dry season, exophagic activity was prevalent only between 1800-2100
   hours; after this (2100-0600 hours) only endophagy was encountered. In
   contrast, during the rainy season, both endophagy and exophagy occurred
   throughout the collection period. The human biting rate for An. darlingi
   was 8.6. This species was positive for Plasmodium vivax VK210 with a
   sporozoite rate = 0.13 (1/788). Breeding sites corresponded to stream (n
   = 7), flooded excavations (n = 4), flooded forest (n = 1), wetlands (n =
   2), and an abandoned water reservoir (n = 1). An. darlingi predominated
   in these sites in both seasons. Based on these data, An. darlingi is the
   main local malaria vector, and we recommend that local prevention and
   control efforts focus on strengthening entomological surveillance to
   determine potential changes of species biting behavior and time to
   reduce human-vector interactions.},

Abstract = {Beavers are ecosystem engineers known to modify the environment
   primarily via dam building. Beaver wetlands are complexes of newly
   created, mature, and abandoned beaver constructions within a stream
   network. Invertebrate dynamics across all habitats derived from these
   successional stages remains poorly explored. Here, we test how this
   natural successional gradient created by beaver affects invertebrate
   beta-diversity and its components (turnover and nestedness).
   Invertebrates were sampled in the Piedmont region of Georgia (U.S.A.) in
   two seasons (autumn and spring) in each of four stages of habitat
   succession: natural stream channels, forested wetlands created by newly
   formed beaver dams, mature open wetland marshes, and abandoned wetland
   meadows. In autumn, invertebrate communities were different among
   successional stages, apart from new versus abandoned wetlands and new
   versus mature wetlands, which were only marginally different, and
   streams versus abandoned wetlands. In spring, only the mature beaver
   wetland communities were unique, differing from both streams and from
   newly formed or abandoned wetlands. Beta-diversity was nearly twice as
   high for the overall study-system than any individual successional
   stage, which all had similar diversity. Additionally, turnover was
   significantly higher than nestedness in all stages. Community
   differences combined with high turnover among successional stages
   indicates that beaver wetland communities are not merely a subset of
   more stable mature wetlands or streams; instead, each stage has a
   different taxonomic make-up. Our results strengthen the idea that beaver
   activity can be an important conservation tool by contributing
   substantially to diversity in areas where they are present. Beaver
   wetlands have the potential to help stabilise beta- and regional
   diversity in the face of wetland loss from climate change and other
   human impacts.},

Abstract = {Since 2000 in Uruguay was evidenced a significant dynamism in land
   market accompanied by the 20 \% decrease in total establishments, mainly
   small-scale. The main objective of the research is to understand how the
   land market has influenced the configuration of livestock production
   systems in a traditionally livestock region of the country. The study of
   market influence as a factor of differentiation of the family production
   systems in Barriga Negra (Lavalleja, Uruguay) was carried out from the
   method of Analysis-Diagnosis of Agrarian Systems. A typology of the
   production systems was constructed and typical cases were selected for
   the accomplishment of economic studies. The types found were forestry
   companies, livestock ranches, livestock farmers from simple to extended
   reproduction, and wage-laborers. The main results showed that the price
   of land acts as a barrier for producers who do not have a productive
   scale, according to the model. Some systems that do get an accumulation,
   however, do so from the lease, and therefore, land prices imply a
   barrier to the purchase and independence. Thus, forest enterprises
   capture land, push for price increases and appropriate land rent from
   the lease of these small units. In this context, without public
   intervention, it seems unlikely that these units will find access
   mechanisms to land, to make their systems viable, so they tend to
   abandon production.},

Abstract = {Seedling planting is the most common strategy used to reintroduce
   tropical native tree species; however, direct sowing has simplicity and
   operational ease advantages. Functional traits such as seed size and
   growth rates have been shown to be relevant for better plant
   performance. We evaluated the effects of intraspecific variation in seed
   size and the reintroduction strategy simultaneously on the development
   of Hymenaea courbaril (L.) and Enterolobium timbouva (Mart.) introduced
   in an abandoned eucalyptus plantation over 462 days. Plants from small,
   medium and large seeds were reintroduced by planting seedlings and
   direct seeding. Both species achieved high rates of emergence and
   survival was high in the two reintroduction strategies. Seed size was
   not related to emergence and mean time to emergence for either species.
   The survival of both species was higher than 74\% in the field, and seed
   size had little effect on survival rates. In general, H. courbaril
   plants introduced by direct sowing had higher growth, and seed size
   correlated positively with stem size. In contrast, the growth of E.
   timbouva plants introduced by seedling planting was higher than in
   plants introduced by direct sowing regardless of seed size. The light
   requirements of this species seem higher than for H. courbaril. Our
   results suggest the feasibility of reintroducing species by direct
   sowing in eucalyptus understory, but since plant growth varies between
   species, there may be a balance between the advantage of the initial
   plant size provided by planting seedlings and the advantage of a better
   root development provided by direct sowing.},

Abstract = {Crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) is a specialized mode of
   photosynthesis that features nocturnal CO2 uptake, facilitates increased
   water-use efficiency (WUE), and enables CAM plants to inhabit
   water-limited environments such as semi-arid deserts or seasonally dry
   forests. Human population growth and global climate change now present
   challenges for agricultural production systems to increase food, feed,
   forage, fiber, and fuel production. One approach to meet these
   challenges is to increase reliance on CAM crops, such as Agave and
   Opuntia, for biomass production on semi-arid, abandoned, marginal, or
   degraded agricultural lands. Major research efforts are now underway to
   assess the productivity of CAM crop species and to harness the WUE of
   CAM by engineering this pathway into existing food, feed, and bioenergy
   crops. An improved understanding of CAM has potential for high returns
   on research investment. To exploit the potential of CAM crops and CAM
   bioengineering, it will be necessary to elucidate the evolution, genomic
   features, and regulatory mechanisms of CAM. Field trials and predictive
   models will be required to assess the productivity of CAM crops, while
   new synthetic biology approaches need to be developed for CAM
   engineering. Infrastructure will be needed for CAM model systems, field
   trials, mutant collections, and data management.},

Volume = {183},
Number = {4},

Abstract = {The classification of Convolvulaceae tribe Merremieae has remained a
   challenge. Merremia, the largest genus, encompasses a wide range of
   morphological variation, particularly in characters such as fruit
   dehiscence and pollen apertures, which are usually diagnostic at the
   generic and even tribal level in the family. The taxonomy of the tribe
   and the included genera has been difficult, especially in assigning
   species to genera. Recent molecular phylogenetic studies did not find
   support for the monophyly of Merremieae and demonstrated that Merremia
   is polyphyletic. However, strongly supported monophyletic groups were
   discovered and diagnosable synapomorphies were identified for these. The
   present study addresses the taxonomic issues with `Merremieae',
   highlighted by previous molecular results. The tribal rank for
   `Merremieae' is abandoned due to lack of morphological and molecular
   evidence and the constituent genera are re-assessed. Morphological,
   palynological and molecular data are synthesized to propose a new
   generic classification for the group. The delimitation of Merremia is
   drastically narrowed. Three new genera are circumscribed and names
   previously published are here applied to these. New combinations are
   published for all taxa that can confidently be placed in this new
   generic scheme based on existing molecular and/or morphological data.},

Journal = {PEDOBIOLOGIA},
Year = {2003},
Volume = {47},

Abstract = {In the Brazilian Amazon region, millions of hectares of forest land have
   been converted into cattle pastures and then been abandoned.
   Agroforestry is a potential option for the transformation of in parts
   degraded lands into productive agricultural systems. The
   re-establishment of a diversified soil macrofauna can help in the
   process of recuperation of the often compacted soil structure of the
   pastures. The soil macrofauna community was studied during the rainy
   season in four different agroforestry systems near Manaus in Central
   Amazonia: 1. a high-input silvopastoral system (ASPh), 2. a low-input
   silvopastoral system (ASPI), 3. a palm based system with four tree crop
   species (AS 1) and 4. a high-diversity tree crop system with ten tree
   crop species (AS2), plus a spontaneous fallow for comparison. The
   sampling method recommended by the Tropical Soil Biology and Fertility
   Programme was used. The highest diversity of fauna groups was observed
   in the ASPh and ASPI where trees were associated with the leguminous
   cover crop, Desmodium ovalifolium. The cover crop exerted a favorable
   effect on the soil fauna presumably by maintaining the soil moist and
   shaded and providing litter as a substrate. Of the 15 soil fauna groups
   that were found in all systems, four were absent from AS1. Within the
   AS2 system a significantly greater density of the soil fauna was
   observed under peach palm (Bactris gasipaes) and cupuacu (Theobroma
   grandiflorum) (3107 and 524 ind.m(-2), respectively) than under the
   other three tree species. The soil under peach palm and cupuacu also
   tended to have a higher number of soil fauna groups. In AS1, the soil
   under peach palm had a higher fauna density than the soil under cupuacu,
   probably caused by the abundant residues of the heart of palm harvest on
   the soil. The earthworm biomass was particularly high in AS 1. Under
   cupuacu approximately 7 times more earthworms were found in AS1 (17.9)
   than in AS2 (2.4). The study of the macrofauna community, including both
   the litter layer and the superficial soil layers, allows to identify the
   plant species/management combinations which favour the increase of the
   diversity of the invertebrates.},

Title = {Ecosystem engineering by leaf-rolling mites enhances arthropod diversity},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF NATURE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {107},
Number = {5},
Month = {OCT 1},
Abstract = {Many arthropods modify parts of plants through the construction of
   domiciles or by consuming plant tissues that, after abandoned, can be
   used as shelter by other arthropods in a facilitating interaction
   process. We examined, for the first time, the potential of leaf-rolling
   mites to indirectly influence arthropod communities in natural forests
   by providing shelter sites. In early June 2019, we found a high density
   of leaves ofAmphitecna tuxtlensis(Bignoniaceae) rolled by an
   undetermined leaf-rolling mite species in a tropical rainforest, in
   Mexico. We tested whether the species richness, abundance, and
   colonization frequency of arthropods was greater in rolled compared with
   expanded leaves. We collected 5 rolled leaves and 5 fully expanded
   leaves from 15A. tuxtlensistrees (N= 150 sampled leaves) and recorded
   all arthropods on each leaf. We recorded 1421 arthropods from 67 unique
   morphospecies. We found 39 individuals from 23 morphospecies of
   arthropods in expanded leaves, and 1382 individuals from 56
   morphospecies in rolled leaves. Ants were the most abundant and frequent
   group and utilized the rolled leaves mainly as nesting sites; 1260 ant
   individuals were found in 30 nests from three species. Arthropod species
   richness, abundance, and colonization frequency were greater in rolled
   leaves compared with expanded leaves. We concluded that the ecosystem
   engineering effect of leaf-rolling mites may be an important structuring
   element for arthropod communities on plants through an increase of high
   quality food resources and shelter sites for other arthropods, as well
   as nesting sites for ants.},

Abstract = {The cropland in the farming-pastoral ecotone of Northern China is highly
   unstable owing to environmental restoration projects, poor soil
   fertility, poverty, and rural labor loss, and it is characterized by a
   large number of fallow fields. Mapping fallow fields in a
   farming-pastoral ecotone can help in evaluating the impact of complex
   cropland landscapes on the environment and food security. To map the
   fallow fields using the Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 archives, a
   multi-metric dataset of vertical transmit-vertical receive + vertical
   transmit-horizontal receive polarization was established. Moreover,
   spectral bands and vegetation index datasets were established using
   Google Earth Engine to classify cropped and fallow fields using the
   Random Forest classifier. The overall accuracies and Kappa coefficients
   of different datasets were assessed to examine the dataset with the
   highest overall accuracy in the main growing season. A 10 m resolution
   fallow map for 2020 was then generated based on the combined Sentinel-1
   and Sentinel-2 datasets with the highest overall accuracy and Kappa
   coefficients were 95.82\% and 0.92, respectively. In addition, the
   time-series characteristics of the entropy eigenvalues generated via
   dual-polarization decomposition were quantitatively evaluated to clarify
   the contribution of the Sentinel-1 synthetic-aperture radar archive to
   the fallow field mapping. The eigenvalues were more sensitive to the
   phenological characteristics of cropped and fallow fields than the
   original backscatter signal of the Sentinel-1 data. Moreover, the
   mapping method was tested at different time intervals by gradually
   aggregating the results across an increasing number of months to
   optimize the fallow field monitoring using the minimum number of
   observations possible within a short period. Data aggregated over August
   achieved the highest one-month accuracy; it was also very close to the
   observations from the whole growing season. The results further
   emphasize the influence of Sentinel-1 archives on fallow field mapping.
   Overall, this study clarifies the potential applicability of Sentinel
   archives for monitoring and mapping managing patterns of agricultural
   land in a region.},

Abstract = {Suitability of degraded areas as breeding habitats can be tested through
   assessment of nest predation rates. In this study we estimated nest
   success in relation to several potential predictors of nest survival in
   the Stripe-tailed Yellow-finch (Sicalis citrina) breeding in abandoned
   mining pits at Brasilia National Park. We monitored 73 nests during the
   2007-breeding season. Predation was the main cause of nest failure (n =
   48, 66\%); while six nests were abandoned (8\%) and 19 nests produced
   young (26\%). Mayfield's daily survival rates and nest success were 0.94
   and 23\%, respectively. Our results from nest survival models on program
   MARK indicated that daily survival rates increase linearly towards the
   end of the breeding season and decrease as nests aged. None of the nest
   individual covariates we tested - nest height, nest size, nest
   substrate, and edge effect - were important predictors of nest survival;
   however, nests placed on the most common plant tended to have higher
   survival probabilities. Also, there was no observer effect on daily
   survival rates. Our study suggests that abandoned mining pits may be
   suitable alternative breeding habitats for Striped-tailed Yellow-finches
   since nest survival rates were similar to other studies in the central
   cerrado region.},

Abstract = {Woody encroachment is occurring in all tropical savannas of the world.
   However, in the Brazilian savanna (the Cerrado), the extent of this

   obtained from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer. The
   associations with potential local drivers, such as fire and land use
   regime, were assessed using satellite data of land cover and fire
   regime. We found that 19\% of the remaining native vegetation showed
   significant evidence of woody encroachment in the last 15 years and 7\%
   exhibited degradation processes. The local factors that favored woody
   expansion in 19\% of the biome were a decrease of fire (34\%) and land
   use abandonment (26\%). Our study highlights that local human-associated
   drivers are playing a major role in woody encroachment and savanna
   degradation.},

Title = {Do an ecosystem engineer and environmental gradient act independently or
   in concert to shape juvenile plant communities? Tests with the
   leaf-cutter ant Atta laevigata in a Neotropical savanna},
Journal = {PEERJ},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {6},
Month = {OCT 9},
Abstract = {Background. Ecosystem engineers are species that transform habitats in
   ways that influence other species.While the impacts of many engineers
   have been well described, our understanding of how their impact varies
   along environmental gradients remains limited. Although disentangling
   the effects of gradients and engineers on biodiversity is
   complicated-the gradients themselves can be altered by engineers- doing
   so is necessary to advance conceptual and mathematical models of
   ecosystem engineering. We used leaf-cutter ants (Atta spp.) to
   investigate the relative influence of gradients and environmental
   engineers on the abundance and species richness of woody plants.
   Methods. We conducted our research in South America's Cerrado. With a
   survey of plant recruits along a canopy cover gradient, and data on
   environmental conditions that influence plant recruitment, we fit
   statistical models that addressed the following questions: (1) Does A.
   laevigata modify the gradient in canopy cover found in our Cerrado site?
   (2) Do environmental conditions that influence woody plant establishment
   in the Cerrado vary with canopy cover or proximity to A. laevigata
   nests? (3) Do A. laevigata and canopy cover act independently or in
   concert to influence recruit abundance and species richness?
   Results. We found that environmental conditions previously shown to
   influence plant establishment in the Cerrado varied in concert with
   canopy cover, but that ants are not modifying the cover gradient or
   cover over nests. However, ants are modifying other local environmental
   conditions, and the magnitude and spatial extent of these changes are
   consistent across the gradient. In contrast to prior studies, we found
   that ant-related factors (e.g., proximity to nests, ant changes in
   surface conditions), rather than canopy cover, had the strongest effect
   on the abundance of plant recruits. However, the diversity of plants was
   influenced by both the engineer and the canopy cover gradient.
   Discussion. Atta laevigata in the Cerrado modify local conditions in
   ways that have strong but spatially restricted consequences for plant
   communities. We hypothesize that ants indirectly reduce seedling
   establishment by clearing litter and reducing soil moisture, which leads
   to seed and seedling desiccation. Altering soil nutrients could also
   reduce juvenile growth and survivorship; if so these indirect negative
   effects of engineering could exacerbate their direct effects of
   harvesting plants. The effects of Atta appear restricted to nest mounds,
   but they could be long-lasting because mounds persist long after a
   colony has died or migrated. Our results support the hypothesis that
   leaf-cutter ants play a dominant role in Cerrado plant demography. We
   suggest the ecological and economic footprint of these engineers may
   increase dramatically in coming decades due to the transformation of the
   Cerrado by human activities.},

Abstract = {The analysis of morphology, sedimentary facies, palynology, carbon and
   nitrogen isotopes, C/N ratio and radiocarbon data from tidal flats
   sediments influenced by the Amazon River indicates that vegetation
   development during the last 5000 cal. yr BP was controlled by
   morphological changes associated with marine and fluvial process. The
   proximal portion of the tidal flat corresponds to abandoned channels
   surrounded by terrestrial vegetation since 5280-5160 cal. yr BP. During
   the last 2840-2750 cal. yr BP, autochthonous organic material became
   prevalent as well as the increase in contribution of terrestrial organic
   matter mainly from `varzea' vegetation. Herbaceous plants already
   colonized the tidal flat before 3170-2970 cal. yr BP, and after
   2630-2310 cal. yr BP and 1350-1290 cal. yr BP they were replaced by
   mangrove vegetation following the development of secondary channels
   connected to the sea with brackish water influence. Furthermore, the
   erosion of the herbaceous field to form chenier ridges/tidal mixed flat
   after 3170-2970 cal. yr BP and before 220-140 cal. yr BP in the distal
   portion of the tidal flat suggests an overall interpretation of a
   retrogradation cycle. This process was driven by a relative sea-level
   rise influenced by the increase of Amazon discharge during the late

Abstract = {The different stages involved in coal mining-related activities result
   in a degraded landscape and sites associated with large amounts of
   dumped waste material. Remediation of these contaminated soils can be
   carried out by application of industrial organic sludge if the concerns
   regarding the potential negative environmental impacts of this
   experimental practice are properly addressed. In this context, the
   objective of this study was to use ecotoxicological tests to determine
   the quantity of organic industrial sludge that is required as a soil
   amendment to restore soil production while avoiding environmental
   impact. Chemical analysis of the solids (industrial sludge and soil) and
   their leachates was carried out as well as a battery of ecotoxicity
   tests on enzymes (hydrolytic activity), bacteria, algae, daphnids,
   earthworms, and higher plants, according to standardized methodologies.
   Solid and leachate samples of coal-contaminated soil were more toxic
   than those of industrial sludge towards enzyme activity, bacteria,
   algae, daphnids, and earthworms. In the case of the higher plants
   (lettuce, corn, wild cabbage, and Surinam cherry) the industrial sludge
   was more toxic than the coal-contaminated soil, and a soil/sludge
   mixture (66:34 \% dry weight basis) had a stimulatory effect on the
   Surinam cherry biomass. The ecotoxicological assessment of the
   coal-contaminated soil remediation using sludge as an amendment is very
   important to determine application rates that could promote a
   stimulatory effect on agronomic species without negatively affecting the

   termed `emerging ecosystems') result when species occur in combinations
   and relative abundances that have not occurred previously within a given

   combinations and the potential for changes in ecosystem functioning, and
   human agency, in that these ecosystems are the result of deliberate or
   inadvertent human action. As more of the Earth becomes transformed by
   human actions, novel ecosystems increase in importance, but are
   relatively little studied. Either the degradation or invasion of native
   or `wild' ecosystems or the abandonment of intensively managed systems
   can result in the formation of these novel systems. Important
   considerations are whether these new systems are persistent and what
   values they may have. It is likely that it may be very difficult or
   costly to return such systems to their previous state, and hence
   consideration needs to be given to developing appropriate management
   goals and approaches.},

Abstract = {Biologists and engineers are making tremendous efforts in contributing
   to a sustainable and green society. To that end, there is growing
   interest in waste management and valorisation. Lignocellulosic biomass
   (LCB) is the most abundant material on the earth and an inevitable waste
   predominantly originating from agricultural residues, forest biomass and
   municipal solid waste streams. LCB serves as the renewable feedstock for
   clean and sustainable processes and products with low carbon emission.
   Cellulose and hemicellulose constitute the polymeric structure of LCB,
   which on depolymerisation liberates oligomeric or monomeric glucose and
   xylose, respectively. The preferential utilization of glucose and/or
   absence of the xylose metabolic pathway in microbial systems cause
   xylose valorization to be alienated and abandoned, a major bottleneck in
   the commercial viability of LCB-based biorefineries. Xylose is the
   second most abundant sugar in LCB, but a non-conventional industrial
   substrate unlike glucose. The current review seeks to summarize the
   recent developments in the biological conversion of xylose into a myriad
   of sustainable products and associated challenges. The review discusses
   the microbiology, genetics, and biochemistry of xylose metabolism with
   hurdles requiring debottlenecking for efficient xylose assimilation. It
   further describes the product formation by microbial cell factories
   which can assimilate xylose naturally and rewiring of metabolic networks
   to ameliorate xylose-based bioproduction in native as well as non-native
   strains. The review also includes a case study that provides an argument
   on a suitable pathway for optimal cell growth and succinic acid (SA)
   production from xylose through elementary flux mode analysis. Finally, a
   product portfolio from xylose bioconversion has been evaluated along
   with significant developments made through enzyme, metabolic and process
   engineering approaches, to maximize the product titers and yield,
   eventually empowering LCB-based biorefineries. Towards the end, the
   review is wrapped up with current challenges, concluding remarks, and
   prospects with an argument for intense future research into xylose-based
   biorefineries.},

Abstract = {For over a hundred years shifting cultivation with slash-and-burn land
   preparation has been the predominant type of land use by smallholders in
   the Bragantina region of the Brazilian Eastern Amazon. This study
   contrasts the nutrient balance of slash-and-burn agriculture with a
   fire-free cultivation. Therefore, one half of a 3.5-year-old (28.7 t DM
   ha(-1)) and a 7-year-old woody fallow vegetation (46.5 t DM ha(-1)) was
   burnt and the other half mulched, leaving the biomass as a surface
   residue. Subsequently, a sequence of maize, beans and cassava was
   cropped for 1.5 year. Burning the 3.5- and 7-year-old fallow removed 97
   and 94\% of the C, 98 and 96\% of the N, 90 and 63\% of the P-stocks,
   and between 45 and 70\% of the cations K, Mg and Ca of the aboveground
   biomass by volatilization or ash-particle transfer. These losses were
   avoided with the slash-and-mulch land preparation. Mulching did not
   increase the losses of nutrients by leaching, despite the high amount of
   rapidly decomposing surface mulch. Also the length of preceding fallow
   had no significant influence on leaching losses. At a depth of 3 m,
   leached nutrients were quantitatively negligible in both treatments.
   Comparing the nutrient fluxes at soil depths of 0.9 m, 1.8 m and 3 m,
   the amounts of all mobile nutrients, and also of chloride and sodium
   were markedly reduced during percolation and must have been retained. It
   is likely that nutrient retention in the subsoil layer is only
   temporary, emphasizing the need for a rapid re-establishment of the
   naturally deeprooting secondary vegetation after abandonment of sites to
   enable uptake of these nutrients. The overall nutrient balance was
   highly negative for slash-and-burn. 291 and 403 kg N ha(-1), 21 and 18
   kg P ha(-1), and 70 and 132 kg K ha(-1) were removed from the burnt
   plots with a preceding fallow of 3.5 and 7 years, respectively. A
   reduced fallow period (3.5 years), which is a common trend in the
   region, resulted in a higher mean annual rate of nutrient loss averaged
   over the duration of the cycle than a fallow period of 7 years.
   Eliminating the burning losses by mulching brought the agricultural
   system back to an equilibrated or even slightly positive nutrient
   balance, even after a reduced fallow period. Thus, slash-and-mulch is a
   viable alternative to maintain agricultural productivity and ecosystem
   functioning.},

Title = {Landscape, agrobiodiversity, and local knowledge in the protected area
   ``Quebrada de los Cuervos y Sierras del Yerbal,{''} Uruguay},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN SUSTAINABLE FOOD SYSTEMS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {7},
Month = {SEP 7},
Abstract = {Introduction: Agrobiodiversity and local knowledge are fundamental
   components in the domestication and structuring of rural landscapes. In
   a context of threats to agroecosystems resulting from changes in
   production systems and rural-urban migration processes, the conservation
   and valorization of agrobiodiversity is a pressing challenge. ``Quebrada
   de los Cuervos and Sierras del Yerbal{''} is a protected landscape in
   Uruguay where a rural community of approximately 30 families with a
   long-standing tradition resides.
   Methods: The research aimed at identifying current and abandoned
   (taperas) domestic contexts, and the plant genetic resources found in
   the area, categorizing their uses and management practices through
   interviews and participant observation.
   Results and discussion: Ethnographic research revealed 185 species (121
   exotic, 64 native) with diverse growth habits, 10 categories of uses,
   and 11 categories for management practices. The differences found
   between houses and taperas revealed that the abandonment of activities
   in rural areas is a relevant factor in the loss of agrobiodiversity.
   Among the 185 species, a notable group of plant genetic resources of
   high cultural significance is recognized due to their consensus of use,
   frequency of management practices, and number of uses. These include
   introduced fruit trees (peach, citrus, and fig) and native fruit trees
   (guayabo del pais, pitanga, and araza), vegetable landraces, native
   trees with multiple uses, yerba mate, and medicinal species such as
   Aristolochia fimbriata. For domestic contexts, a model of spatial
   distribution of agrobiodiversity is proposed, cultivated spaces where
   the plant genetic resources are located in home gardens and small plots,
   managed spaces where the resources are found in the surroundings of
   houses, and promoted and intervened wild spaces where the species are
   used from natural grasslands and wild environments. The obtained
   information reaffirms the need to conserve this biocultural landscape,
   placing agrobiodiversity and local knowledge as a focal point in the
   protected area. The management plan must be formulated with active
   participation from the rural community, aiming for valorization through
   integration into agroecological production chains, among other
   possibilities.},

Abstract = {Soil quality under usage through time, and within agroecosystems, is an
   important aspect in order to improve soil usage sustainability in
   tropical regions. In this scenario, quantifying the effects of time of
   usage in pastures under the different soil components (macropores) is
   important to determine the management planning and reclamation most
   adequate for such areas. The objective of this study was to evaluate the
   time effect in pastures (4, 5 and 8 years) on macropore volume after ten
   years of abandonment and nine of reclamation through Capoeira and
   agroecosystems. Macropore volume was measured in three different depths
   (0-5; 5-10 and 10-15 cm) in 100 cm(3) steel cylinders. Macropore volume
   dropped significantly with the raise in time usage of the areas as
   pasture, which in turn makes time usage evident in pastures over
   macropore volume of soil >= 50 mu m, mainly in the first soil layer (0-5
   cm), directly affected by animal impact. Therefore, it is suggested that
   time of soil reclamation should be longer than ten years so that the
   soil characteristics can be recovered.},

Abstract = {Reforestation efforts are being promoted throughout the humid tropics in
   response to increased areas of deforested and abandoned or degraded
   lands. Farmers need technical information on species performance,
   plantation design and management in order to make appropriate choices of
   species and silvicultural techniques to achieve high productivity. In
   Costa Rica, government incentives have promoted the planting of native
   tree species, but information is still scarce on species performance and
   silvicultural management. The present study examines the growth and
   responses to thinning of native species in mixed and pure-species
   plantations in the Caribbean Lowlands of Costa Rica. At 9-10 years of
   age, the species with best growth in diameter and volume were Vochysia
   guatemalensis Donn. Sm., Terminalia amazonia (J. Gmell) Excell,
   Jacaranda copaia (Aubl) D. Don, Virola koschnyi Warb. and
   Vochysiaferruginea Mart. Most species had better growth in mixed than in
   pure-species plantations. The slower growing species Calophyllum
   brasiliense Cambess and Genipa americana L. grew better in pure than in
   mixed stands. Mixed plantations (combinations of 3-4 species) ranked
   among the most productive in terms of volume. Trees responded to
   thinning with increased diameter growth, while height was not generally
   influenced by thinning. Tight initial spacing and thinning with high
   extraction of stems can improve growth and timber quality of stands.
   Results of the present research are useful to improve species choices
   for reforestation and plantation management in the humid lowlands of
   Costa Rica and in other regions with similar ecological characteristics.

Abstract = {We studied the consequences of rice cultivation and its subsequent
   abandonment for soil organic matter (SOM) dynamics in northeastern
   Argentina. Two chronosequences, which included a pristine grassland with
   C4 vegetation as a control, and several stages of rice (C3) fields
   abandoned for 1, 2, 4, 6 and 15 years were selected, and soil samples
   from the first 10 cm were gathered from each plot. Natural C-13
   abundance coupled with particle-size fractionation were employed to
   characterize SOM changes through time discriminated by SOM origin. Soil
   samples up to 50 cm were also collected throughout one chronosequence.
   Most changes in SOM occurred on the first 20 cm layer and, bulk density,
   carbon and nitrogen content, as well as delta C-13 remained similar at
   greater depths. After the rice cropping, the bulk density was slightly
   greater than in the natural grassland, and remained stable after the
   abandonment. Carbon and nitrogen contents remained almost stable in the
   surface layer during the cultivation. delta C-13 varied accordingly with
   the changes in vegetation cover with a C4 signature in the natural
   grassland and mainly a C3 signature in the rice fields. The abandonment
   of the rice cropping induced a decrease of the soil organic matter
   content, mainly of natural grassland origin, during the first 4 years.
   When the abandonment extended, the SOM content (from C4 origin)
   increased slowly and after 15 years, was almost the same as that of the
   natural grassland. The carbon turnover was greater in the coarser
   fractions than in the finer ones, confirming that soil organic carbon in
   the sand fraction was relatively labile. However, all the fractions were
   affected by inputs and outputs of C derived from rice and natural
   grassland. This fact could indicate that the former protected carbon
   could become less stable due to cultivation. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {Harsh weather and natural enemies are the two main causes of colony
   abandonment by social wasps. The selection of nesting sites with
   characteristics that provide shelter from these threats is therefore a
   key factor for colony survival. Our study aimed to understand the
   selection and association between social wasps and nesting substrate.
   Data collection was carried out between February 2011 and February 2014
   in an urban fragment named Jardim Botanico da Universidade Federal de
   Juiz de Fora, in the southeastern part of Minas Gerais. In order to
   assess the type of substrate used, we divided them into natural
   vegetative substrates and man-made substrates. Five-day sampling
   campaigns were carried out monthly, in which the colonies found were
   photographed and their distance from the ground and substrate were
   catalogued. Colonies were generally more abundant during the rainy
   season. Colonies in man-made substrates were recorded in greater
   frequencies in heights between two and five metres, while for vegetal
   substrates these heights were usually below two metres. We observed that
   independent-founding social wasps in an emergent ecosystem tend to nest
   in man-made substrates and, generally, in exotic plants, which
   highlights the importance of such substrates in maintaining the

Abstract = {Seed dispersal effectiveness (SDE) is a useful framework to explore the
   evolutionary and ecological consequences of seed dispersal to plant
   fitness. However, SDE is poorly studied in tropical open grasslands.
   Here, we studied both quantitative and qualitative components of SDE in
   two species of Miconia (Melastomataceae) from ferruginous campo
   rupestre, a vegetation highly threatened by mining activities. We
   determined fruit traits and fruit availability and found that fruits of
   both species are produced in times of resource scarcity at the study
   site. Based on the number of visits and the number of fruits removed per
   visit, we calculated the quantitative component of SDE for both species.
   Finally, we explored the qualitative component of SDE by means of a
   controlled experiment that simulated the effects of gut passage on seed
   germination. Bird species differed strongly in the quantitative
   component of SDE. Gut passage did not affect germination compared with
   hand-extracted seeds, except for a minor negative effect on germination
   time in M. pepericarpa. However, seeds within intact fruits showed lower
   germination percentages compared with hand-extracted seeds. Our data
   indicate that Miconia species from ferruginous campo rupestre are
   visited by a diverse assemblage of generalist birds that differ in
   quantitative, but not qualitative, seed dispersal effectiveness. We
   argue that planting Miconia species can overcome seed limitation in
   degraded areas and thus assist ecological restoration after mining
   abandonment.},

Title = {Simultaneous competition and environmental filtering in woody
   communities of the understory of Eucalyptus plantations in the
   Cerrado},
Journal = {PERSPECTIVES IN PLANT ECOLOGY EVOLUTION AND SYSTEMATICS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {59},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Dense and species-rich understory communities have been commonly found
   in old or abandoned stands of Eucalyptus plantations in the Cerrado
   domain presenting plant species and ecological niches that suggest a
   repository of the original biodiversity. This repository depends on the
   largely unknown effect of Eucalyptus plantations on their understories.
   We addressed this issue by testing if the effect of Eucalyptus trees on
   the assembly of Cerrado communities causes environmental filtering or
   competitive exclusion. For the test, 40 plots (20 inside stands and 20
   outside) were allocated and all woody plants with a circumference at the
   ground level equal to or greater than 10 cm were sampled. Species
   richness, diversity indexes and species turnover were determined. The
   phylogenetic structure was evaluated at different scales using the
   values of Mean Pairwise Distance (MPD), the Mean Nearest Taxon Distance
   (MNTD), the Net Relatedness Index (NRI) and the Nearest Taxon Index
   (NTI), as well as phylobetadiversity indices. The metrics of alpha and
   beta phylogenetic diversity (NTI, MNTD, NRI and MPD, betaMPD and
   betaMNTD) fell within the random expectation in each plant community,
   suggesting a phylogenetic uniformity, but fewer plants of the Fabaceae
   family than expected by chance were detected outside Eucalyptus stands
   suggesting that this family is filtered in inside Eucalyptus stands.
   Species richness is lower inside than outside Eucalyptus stands. The
   pattern is congruent with simultaneous environmental filtering and
   competitive exclusion in a context of niche conservatism which means
   that functional traits are conserved within phylogenetic lineages.},

Abstract = {Large-scale oil palm cultivation with intensive pesticide use has been
   growing worldwide and reached the Brazilian Amazon. The rapid expansion
   of this crop over the last decade has reached vast areas, including the
   boundaries of different indigenous lands. This study aimed at assessing
   the occurrence of pesticide residues in surface and ground waters as
   well as drainage sediments in the Ture `-Mariquita Indigenous Territory,
   in addition to other nearby indigenous villages in the northeastern
   state of Par ` a. Thirty-three (33) water samples were collected from
   streams, springs and from active and abandoned wells at 19 sampling
   points, as well as 16 sediment samples at 9 sampling sites both during
   dry and rainy seasons. In total, 49 environmental samples were taken
   during fieldworks and subsequently analyzed by means of liquid
   chromatography and mass-mass spectrometry. The analytical determination
   of pesticide residues showed the occurrence of three pesticides in the
   water both from streams and from wells, two of them knowingly used by
   the oil palm company: glyphosate-based herbicides (GBHs) and endosulfan
   insecticides. Although the highest glyphosate and endosulfan levels as
   well as the maximum concentration of glyphosate found in ground water
   are within the Brazilian environmental regulatory guidelines, all the
   values for human consumption found in the glyphosate-containing samples
   are well above the European Union regulatory standards. Our results draw
   the attention to the risks of biota contamination and human exposure to
   multiple-pesticide residues.},

Journal = {REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE},

Abstract = {With the intensification of agriculture and livestock in the Cerrado
   biome, the ecosystem services provided in this biome occur, in large
   part, in the fragments that make up multifunctional landscapes. In this
   context, this study aimed to investigate the following: (1) the
   importance of savannic ecosystems and abandoned pastures for carbon
   storage through soil organic carbon (SOC); (2) how microenvironmental
   differences can lead to variations in the SOC in each of these
   ecosystems. For this, environmental and biophysical data were collected
   in cerrado sensu stricto (s.s.), abandoned pastures, and palm swamps
   (veredas). The veredas had SOC contents six times higher than the
   cerrado s.s. and pastures. The main ecological factors related to SOC
   were the presence of xylophagous arthropods and the sum of bases (SB) in
   the cerrado s.s; saturation by aluminum (m) in pastures, and soil
   organic matter (SOM) in veredas. Soil moisture showed different
   relationships with SOC according to its ecosystem: neutral in the
   cerrado s.s., linear negative in the pastures, and positive exponential
   in the veredas. SOC storage in the first 30 cm of depth was
   approximately double in the veredas, but with a heterogeneous
   distribution. Therefore, specific microenvironments in veredas were
   important environmental assets for carbon storage in the multifunctional
   landscape. In this ecosystem, the exotic species Pinus caribaea
   indicated soil with lower carbon concentrations, and the
   microenvironments with more saturated soils were also more susceptible
   to variations in the SOC content.},

Abstract = {In Neotropical mangroves the crabs Ucides cordatus and Goniopsis
   cruentata have been considered the most significant propagule consumers,
   but their relative importance has not been investigated. The aim of this
   study was to compare the magnitude of predation by these crabs on three
   mangrove species propagules: Avicennia schaueriana, Laguncularia
   racemosa and Rhizophora mangle. We found that G. cruentata is a more
   important predator than U. cordatus in both natural and restored areas.
   We also tested the hypothesis that Ucides and Goniopsis have
   antagonistic effects on propagules predation using a cage experiment
   where the presence/absence of these species was manipulated in a 2 x 2
   factorial design. The effects of Goniopsis were stronger in the absence
   of Ucides due to negative interactions between these predator species.
   Moreover, we found that Goniopsis preference for A. schaueriana and L.
   racemosa can favor the dominance of R. mangle in Neotropical mangroves.
   This study suggests that propagule predation by Goniopsis should be
   controlled in mangrove restoration programs at abandoned shrimp farms
   and destroyed areas, if dominance by R. mangle is undesirable relative
   to mixed species communities.},

Abstract = {Is the conflict of man versus nature a new synthesis for restoration
   processes? What models do we use to understand and apply restoration?
   What are the implications resulting from the choice of a paradigm for
   the restoration process? The development of the human race on Earth
   required drastic changes in the landscapes, structures and
   functionalities of the planet's ecosystems. Techniques of productivity
   were responsible for the maintenance of the society, but those
   techniques do not serve to restitute nature, because the restoration of
   biodiversity is not a synonymous of productivity. A new tendency of
   restorers is to retrieve models of biofunctionality conservation and of
   interactions among the organisms of the system. Nucleation represents an
   opportunity to apply the key principles of the metaphor of the ``flow of
   nature{''} to the practice of ecological restoration. The proposal of
   the nucleation model is biocentric, namely, to aid nature in nuclei
   covering about 10-30\% of the degraded area, allowing a complex network
   of interactions between the organisms and a successional heterogeneity
   to be reestablished in the remaining space, where the ecosystem can
   converge towards multiple points of equilibrium in space and time.},

Title = {Changes in secondary vegetation dynamics in a context of decreasing
   deforestation rates in Para, Brazilian Amazon},
Journal = {APPLIED GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {106},
Pages = {40-49},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Tropical secondary vegetation is of particular interest as carbon sinks,
   potential lands for agriculture and livestock expansion, biodiversity
   conservation and ecosystem services. Until mid-2000s estimates of
   secondary vegetation in the Brazilian Amazon indicated a progressive
   increase of this cover, however after 2010, only 1197 km(2) of
   additional secondary vegetation were generated, while 42,040 km(2) were
   converted into other land-covers. Meanwhile, deforestation rates
   progressively decreased to be around 6000 km(2) in contrast to the peak
   of 27,772 km(2) in 2004, what suggests that changes in land-cover
   dynamics with respect to deforestation may be related to a reduction in
   secondary vegetation. Hence, in this paper, we work with the hypothesis
   that, in a context of decreasing deforestation rates, the historic
   pattern of progressive accumulation of secondary vegetation in the
   Brazilian Amazon changed as a consequence of the re-conversion of this
   cover, as well as other land-covers relevant in the process of
   regeneration, into different land-covers that expanded in this period.
   Our focus was then to investigate, on a regional scale, the
   spatiotemporal patterns of secondary vegetation with respect to
   different land-covers in Para based on (i) a quantitative analysis of
   transitions between land-covers, and (ii) on clustering patterns of
   secondary vegetation cover and their relations with clustering patterns
   of pastures, small-scale and industrial agriculture. We found that more
   secondary vegetation was converted into land-covers that expanded in the
   period i.e. dean pasture, mechanized agriculture, and palm oil, with
   secondary vegetation and land-covers important for regeneration (i.e.
   small-scale agriculture and regeneration with pasture) experiencing an
   overall reduction and contributing less to the concentration of
   secondary vegetation after 2010. Clusters of high values (hotspots) of
   secondary vegetation prevailed in the north, while clusters of low
   values (cold spots) prevailed in the south of Para, a pattern that is
   explained by different histories of occupation and deforestation
   dynamics, as well as distinct regional land dynamics in the past decade.
   As a first contribution to understanding the dynamics of secondary
   vegetation in a context of decreasing deforestation rates, our results
   show that the increased pressure to halt deforestation had effects over
   the dynamics of this land-cover, as well as over land-covers relevant to
   regeneration.},

Title = {Taking cultural landscapes into account: Implications for scaling up
   ecological restoration},
Journal = {LAND USE POLICY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {120},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Conceptual frameworks for landscape restoration commonly take an
   approach focused on ecological (biotic and abiotic) aspects. Yet the
   recent initiatives demanding that restoration be scaled up to restore
   millions of hectares of degraded land often encounter socio-cultural
   challenges too, such as competing land-use interests and low stakeholder
   engagement. Thus, consideration also needs to be given to cultural
   landscapes, broadly defined as regions that reflect the long-term
   interactions between people and the environment. Based on a literature
   survey we here identify and then discuss features from cultural
   landscapes-ecological restoration research, which can be relevant to
   ecological restoration upscaling. Overall, research encompassing
   cultural landscapes is revealed as less narrowly-focused than that on
   landscape ecology linked with ecological restoration: our selected
   studies quite frequently considered social and landscape aspects in
   addition to ecological aspects. Geographically, research is strongly
   biased towards Europe and North America, although the most ambitious
   restoration targets are in the tropics. Taking cultural landscapes into
   account could enhance restoration by (1) moving towards a
   transdisciplinary approach thereby offsetting the overemphasis on
   ecological aspects, and (2) mitigating issues of land use and
   stakeholder engagement. Further research, paying special attention to
   the tropics, should aim at integrative approaches that would contribute
   to scaling up restoration, not only in single large-scale projects but
   also through the sum of small but concerted actions.},

Abstract = {In this study we described the seed rain generated by bats under four
   Cerrado's tree species common within pastures, Buchenavia tomentosa,
   Couepia grandiflora, Licania humilis and Qualea grandiflora. We analyzed
   the similarity among the four tree species in terms of seed rain
   composition, and compared the number of seeds and seed species deposited
   under them. Besides that, we assessed the relationship between seed rain
   intensity and the density of each tree species. Then, we randomly
   selected 10 mature trees of each species to sample seed rain. We
   recorded a total of 4892 bat dispersed seeds from 11 species. Also, we
   observed that along the year seed deposition varied substantially under
   all trees. At least two seed sub-communities could be distinguished
   according to tree species used by bats as feeding roost. One related to
   Couepia grandiflora and Licania humilis, and the other to Buchenavia
   tomentosa and Qualea grandiflora trees. The variability of seed rain
   composition in any particular tree and the range of actual seed fall
   into a particular species indicate patchiness in seed rain, and the
   overall results appear to be consistent in terms of a substantial and
   diverse seed rain generated by bats in a highly anthropized landscape.
   This is the first study concerning seed dispersal by bats in modified
   Brazilian Cerrado, one of the most endangered biomes in the world. In
   this respect, by preserving a dense and diverse collection of remnant
   trees within today's pastures may, potentially, contribute to a faster
   Cerrado recovery in extensive areas that can be reclaimed for
   restoration in the future.},

Title = {Impact of the conversion of Brazilian woodland savanna (cerradao)
   to pasture and Eucalyptus plantations on soil nitrogen
   mineralization},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {704},
Month = {FEB 20},
Abstract = {The Brazilian savanna (Cerrado) has been extensively converted to
   croplands, pastures and forestry plantations, and the deforestation
   frontier continues expanding. Land conversion may cause critical changes
   in soil functioning, yet very little is still known about the impact of
   Cerrado conversion on nutrient cycling and soil fertility. Here, we
   addressed this knowledge gap by investigating the effects of the
   woodland cerrado (cerradao) conversion into pastures and Eucalyptus
   plantations on nitrogen availability and mineralization potential,
   considering a wide range of spatial and temporal variability due to soil
   depth, site conditions, and seasonal variation. For three sites in Sao
   Paulo state and each of the target land cover types, we assessed the
   total N and inorganic N (NH4-N and NO3-N) pools, potentially
   mineralizable nitrogen (PMN) and soil urease activity in the first 2 m
   of the soil profile. Cerrado conversion to either pastures or Eucalyptus
   plantations significantly reduced NH4-N, while NO3-N showed similar
   values in Cerrado and Eucalyptus and lower values in pastures. We found
   a consistent pattern of lower N mineralization in the uppermost soil
   layers associated to Cerrado conversion, with decreases in PMN rate and
   urease activity. The soil below 30 cm depth showed no relevant changes.
   Considering the first 30 cm of the soil profile, the reduction in the
   stocks of inorganic N (NH4-N + NO3-N) ranged from similar to 14\% for
   the conversion to Eucalyptus to similar to 20\% for the conversion to
   pasture. The impact of land conversion on N cycling surpassed the
   influence of the spatial (between-site) and seasonal variation. Overall,
   the results indicate a decline in available N and overall soil fertility
   due to Cerrado conversion, which could further increase N limitation in
   the Cerrado region, increase fertilization needs for future
   exploitation, and compromise the recovery of Cerrado in case of land
   abandonment or restoration. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Optimization of the In Vitro Proliferation of an Ancient Pear
   Tree Cultivar ('Decana d'inverno') through the Use of Neem Oil},
Journal = {PLANTS-BASEL},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {12},

Abstract = {In vitro culture, ensuring rapid multiplication and production of plant
   material under aseptic conditions, represents an excellent tool for
   ex-situ conservation of tree species biodiversity and can be used for
   the conservation, among others, of endangered and rare crops. Among the
   Pyrus communis L. cultivars that have been abandoned over the years due
   to changed cultivation requirements, but which are still used today in
   breeding programs, there is the `Decana d'inverno'. Pear is generally
   considered a recalcitrant species for in vitro propagation due to weak
   multiplication rate, hyperhydricity, and susceptibility to phenolic
   oxidation. Therefore, the use of natural substances like neem oil
   (although little explored) represents one of the options to improve the
   in vitro plant's tissue culture. In this context, the aim of the present
   work was to evaluate the effect of adding neem oil (0.1 and 0.5 m L L-1)
   to the growth substrate in order to optimise the in vitro culture of the
   ancient pear tree cultivar `Decana d'inverno'. The neem oil addition
   resulted in an increase in the number of shoots produced especially at
   both concentrations used. On the contrary, an increase in length of
   proliferated shoots was observed only with the addition of 0.1 mL L-1.
   The neem oil addition did not affect the explants viability, fresh and
   dry weights. Therefore, the present study demonstrated for the first
   time the possibility of using neem oil to optimise the in vitro culture
   of an ancient pear tree cultivar.},

Abstract = {A study was conducted to explore the plant biodiversity and vegetation
   structure of Biha Valley, District Swat, Pakistan. On the basis of the
   physiognomy of the vegetation the study area was divided into 19 stands.
   Line transect (50 m) method was used to sample the phytosociological
   attributes of the study area. PCORD software (version 5) was used to
   recognize communities by two-way indicator species analysis (TWINSPAN)
   and CANOCO software (version 5) for ordination analysis was done for
   detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) and canonical correspondence
   analysis (CCA) to find variation directories of different plant species.
   Different life-form classes and leaf size spectra were recorded
   according to the Raunkiaer classification. The floristic composition of
   the area consists of 203 plant species belonging to 154 genera and 70
   families. The biological spectrum of the area indicated that Therophytes
   was dominant with 46.60\% among the life-classes, followed by
   Hemicryptophytes having 15.53\%. Leaf spectra of study area revealed
   that Microphylls was dominant (41.26\%) followed by Nanophylls
   (32.04\%). Seven plant communities were recognized by TWINSPAN
   classification, which showed that species diversity decreased with
   altitude. Moreover, the result indicates the importance of soil organic
   matter in top soil layers for plant species distribution. The increases
   in soil nutrients (OM, P, N, and K), improvement in site conditions
   (community cover, depth of litter, depth of humus, soil water content)
   and decrease in soil bulk density indicated the natural habitat
   restoration following abandonment.},

Title = {Europe as a model for large carnivores conservation: Is the glass half
   empty or half full?},
Journal = {JOURNAL FOR NATURE CONSERVATION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {41},
Pages = {73-78},

Abstract = {At first sight, the increasing trend of many large mammal populations in
   EU Member States are the results from successful application of EU
   environmental legislation. In this perspective a `rewilding' Europe
   appears as a laudable conservation goal. It has been therefore suggested
   that the EU model of carnivores-humans coexistence could be of interest
   to several other regions of the Planet. In the present paper we
   critically review alleged successes of the EU conservation policies. Our
   conclusions suggest that some optimistic reports should be taken
   cautiously. Firstly, one should not lose sight of the heterogeneity of
   `Europe' and the different histories and socio-ecological situations of
   the 28 Member States. Furthermore, we doubt whether the positive status
   of large carnivores in Eastern Europe is attributable exclusively to EU
   conservation policies. Long time spans necessary for demographic
   recovery in large carnivores sharply contradict the quite recent entry
   of these countries into the EU. The EU model is possible owing to the
   unique socio-economic development that Western Europe experienced after
   the Second World War. Economic growth, urbanization, rural abandonment
   and reforestation are the main forces behind the increase of large
   mammals in some areas of Western Europe. Yet this has been possible only
   through a considerable input of natural resources from outside EU (food,
   raw materials, oil, gas etc.). Therefore, although there are examples
   that could be considered good experiences, we are of the opinion that
   the EU policies as a general model is unlikely to be exportable
   world-wide and may have negative consequences for wildlife, even in
   Eastern Europe.},

   into bodies of water where mosquitoes breed is a common strategy for

   studies from epidemiology, conservation, ecology and evolution to show
   that the evidence for the effectiveness of guppies in controlling
   mosquitoes is weak, that the chances of accidental guppy introduction
   into local ecosystems are large, and that guppies can easily establish
   populations and damage these aquatic ecosystems. We highlight several
   knowledge and implementation gaps, and urge that this approach is either
   abandoned in favour of more effective strategies or that it is used much
   more rigorously. Controlling mosquitoes does not need to come at the

Abstract = {In times of global environmental change, the sustainability of
   human-environment systems is only possible through a better
   understanding of ecosystem processes. An assessment of anthropogenic
   environmental impacts depends upon monitoring natural ecosystems. These
   systems are intrinsically complex and dynamic, and are characterized by
   ecological gradients. Remote sensing data repeatedly collected in a
   systematic manner are suitable for describing such gradual changes over
   time and landscape gradients, e.g., through information on the
   vegetation's phenology. Specifically, imaging spectroscopy is capable of
   describing ecosystem processes, such as primary productivity or leaf
   water content of vegetation. Future spaceborne imaging spectroscopy
   missions like the Environmental Mapping and Analysis Program (EnMAP)
   will repeatedly acquire high-quality data of the Earth's surface, and
   will thus be extremely useful for describing natural ecosystems and the
   services they provide. In this conceptual paper, we present some of the
   preparatory research of the EnMAP Scientific Advisory Group (EnSAG) on
   natural ecosystems and ecosystem transitions. Through two case studies
   we illustrate the usage of spectral indices derived from multi-date
   imaging spectroscopy data at EnMAP scale, for mapping vegetation
   gradients. We thus demonstrate the benefit of future EnMAP data for
   monitoring ecological gradients and natural ecosystems.},

Abstract = {Asexually reproducing fungi play a significant role in essential
   processes in managed and wild ecosystems such as nutrients cycling and
   multitrophic interactions. A large number of such taxa are among the
   most notorious plant and animal pathogens. In addition, they have a key
   role in food production, biotechnology and medicine. Taxa without or
   rare sexual reproduction are distinguished based on their sporulating
   structures and conidiomata in traditional morphology-based taxonomy. The
   number, variation and diversity of asexually reproducing taxa are
   insufficiently known, even though fungi capable of asexual reproduction
   may provide an untapped, rich biological resource for future
   exploitation. Currently, ca. 30,000 asexual species belonging to ca.
   3800 genera have been reported (including 1388 coelomycetous and 2265
   hyphomycetous genera). Recent reports (2017-2020) reiterate that the
   number of asexually producing fungi is higher than the number of
   frequently sexually-reproducing fungi. With the advent of molecular
   tools and the abandonment of the dual nomenclature system for
   pleomorphic fungi, priority criteria were established and revisited in
   the latest outline of fungi and fungus-like taxa. However, species
   numbers and taxonomic boundaries of pleomorphic taxa and their
   synanamorphs or synasexual morphs have yet to be addressed. The number
   of species of speciose genera (e.g. Alternaria, Aspergillus, Cercospora,
   Fusarium, Phoma and Pseudocercospora), cryptic species, species of
   pleomorphic genera, less studied life modes (such as lichenicolous taxa,
   taxa from extreme environments) and species from biodiversity-rich areas
   still need evaluation to achieve more reliable estimates of their
   diversity. This paper discusses the current knowledge on the matter,
   with diversity estimates, and potential obstacles in several chapters on
   (1) speciose genera; (2) pleomorphic genera; (3) cryptic species; (4)
   well-studied but insufficiently resolved taxa, e.g. leaf inhabiting
   species, marine fungi, (5) less studied life modes, e.g. lichenicolous,
   rock-inhabiting fungi, insect-associated and yeast-forming taxa and (6)
   species from biodiversity-rich areas.},

Title = {The spatiotemporal change of cropland and its impact on vegetation
   dynamics in the farming-pastoral ecotone of northern China},

Abstract = {Due to the unfavorable soil conditions and water resources, the cropland
   use pattern in the farming-pastoral ecotone in northern China is
   complex. The program named ``Grain for Green{''} has accelerated the
   cropland change. However, the complex cropland and retired cropland are
   challenging to monitor with remote sensing due to their spatially
   dispersed and easily confused with spectrally similar land use classes
   such as nature grasslands and non-cropped fields. Taking
   farming-pastoral ecotone in the northern foot of the Yinshan Mountains
   as a case study, we explored a classification approach for complex
   cropland and retired cropland, which was introduced as a specific land
   use class by using multi-temporal Landsat TM and OLI images with Google
   Earth Engine. During 1990-2000, cropland increased with a sharper growth
   and increased with a slower growth from 2001 to 2010, and then decreased
   significantly from 2011 to 2019, to lead the cropland area in 2019 was
   smaller than an area in 1990. We analyzed the spatiotemporal
   trajectories of retired cropland in 2019 using the Land Use Change
   Trajectory method to evaluate its source. In our finding, approximately
   77\% of retired cropland was labelled as cropland before 2019; albeit,
   not all retired cropland was converted from cropland. Moreover, we
   qualitatively assessed the vegetation dynamics in the study area by
   utilizing the long-term NDVI-mean value to reveal that vegetation
   coverage has shown a continuously increasing trend. It is related to the
   decline of cropland and the increase of retired cropland at the same
   rate. Our results highlighted that},

Title = {RAINFALL AND WATER YIELD IN MACIZO DEL CAROIG, EASTERN IBERIAN
   PENINSULA. EVENT RUNOFF AT PLOT SCALE DURING A RARE FLASH FLOOD AT THE
   BARRANCO DE BENACANCIL},

Abstract = {Floods are a consequence of extreme rainfall events. Although surface
   runoff generation is the origin of discharge, flood research usually
   focuses on lowlands where the impact is higher. Runoff and sediment
   delivery at slope and pedon scale receiving much less attention in the
   effort to understand flood behaviour in time and space. This is
   especially relevant in areas where, due to climatic and hydrogeological
   conditions, streams are ephemeral, socalled dry rivers ({''}wadis{''},
   ``ramblas{''} or ``barrancos{''}) that are widespread throughout the
   Mediterranean. This paper researches the relationship between water
   delivery at pedon and slope scale with dry river floods in Macizo del
   Caroig, Eastern Iberian Peninsula. Plots of 1x1, 1x2, 1x4, and 2x8 m
   located in the ``El Teularet{''} Soil Erosion and Degradation Research
   Station were monitored from 2004 to 2014 to measure soil and water
   delivery. Rainfall and flow at the dry river Barranco de Benacancil were
   also monitored. Results show that runoff and sediment discharge were
   concentrated in few events during the 11 years of research. A single
   flood event was registered in the channel on September 28, 2009,
   however, the runoff was registered 160 times at the plots. Runoff
   discharge was dependent on the size of the plots, with larger plots
   yielding lower runoff discharge per unit area, suggesting short
   runoff-travel distance and duration. Three rainfall events contributed
   with 26\% of the whole runoff discharge, and five achieved 56\% of the
   runoff. We conclude that the runoff generated at the plot scale is
   disconnected from the main channel. From a spatial point of view, there
   is a decrease in runoff coefficient along the slope. From a temporal
   point of view, the runoff is concentrated in a few rainfall events.
   These results show that the runoff generated at plot and slope scale
   does not contribute to the floods except for rainfall events with more
   than 100 mm day(-1). The disconnection of the runoff and sediment
   delivery is confirmed by the reduction in the runoff delivery at plot
   scale due to the control of the length of the plot (slope) on the runoff
   and sediment delivery.},
