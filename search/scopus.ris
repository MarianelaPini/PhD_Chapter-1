AB  - Understanding the effect of different C. citriodora removal management in a Conservation Unit (CU) aimed at forest restoration on the dynamics of the labile and stable fractions of the SOM and to quantify the stoichiometric relationships of these fractions. Soil samples were collected in four areas in the União Biological Reserve (REBIO), Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, namely: forest (FF); C. citriodora trees submitted to girdling (GR); C. citriodora trees submitted to the practice of clear cutting and subsequent planting of native species (PL); abandoned C. citriodora trees without management practice (EU). In these samples, the total content of carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) in the air-dried fine earth (ADFE) were determined; in light-fraction organic matter (LFOM) and in the particle size fractions of SOM. It was observed that the C:N and C:P ratios were higher in the EU area and lower in PL in both ADFE and LFOM samples. In EU, lower levels of C, N and P were observed in the SOM particulate fraction. GR favors the production of less recalcitrant and more labile material when compared to EU. The short time (4 years) of implementation of the system in PL directly affects the low production of LFOM; however, this material has high levels of N and P, favoring the low C:N and C:P ratio. EU intensifies the concentration of nutrients in stable fractions in the soil, which can favor the preservation of the soil structure, mitigating its losses. © 2024 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Understanding the dynamics of endemic tree component species based on natural regeneration (NR) and adult trees (AT) is essential for formulating conservation strategies for protecting these species. The objective of the present study was to identify endemic species in a preserved area of secondary forest in the Atlantic Forest domain in Brazil and to evaluate their dynamics over 24 years. Based on inventories carried out from 1992 to 2016 of the NR (diameter at breast height-dbh ≤ 5 cm) and of the AT (dbh ≥ 5 cm) in ten sites with different characteristics (physiographic, edaphic, and successional), it was possible to, initially, identify 58 species classified as endemic to Brazil (EBR) and/or those exclusive to the Brazilian Atlantic Forest (EAF), among the 226 species in the entire survey. Subsequently, this classification was reassessed based on updated information on its occurrence, and only 38 of these species were maintained as endemic to Brazil and/or to the Atlantic Forest. Some species were recorded in the AT and NR strata, in different sites, throughout the study period, while others occurred in only one level (AT or NR), some with low abundance. Among these endemic species, eight are included in the endangered species lists, and 15 can be classified as rare, as there was only one individual in the survey. Considering the two arboreal strata it was observed that some species were abundant in the forest in all inventories and several sites, while others went throughout the study period with few individuals and, in some cases, disappeared due to mortality. These results contribute to understanding the factors that can affect the local abundance of endemic species over time, allowing the definition of conservation actions for protecting these vulnerable species, thus avoiding their extinction. © 2023, Sociedade de Investigacoes Florestais.

AB  - Questions: Our study aims to understand whether priority effects or environmental filters drive community assembly in 20-year-old restoration areas in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. For this, we investigated the following questions: (i) does the initial composition of planted communities (distinct combination of ecological groups) affect the natural regeneration regarding functional composition (mean trait values), diversity (functional and taxonomic), and vegetation structure? (ii) Which functional traits of the planted community have the potential to promote or constrain natural regeneration?. Location: The study was carried out in the Poço das Antas Biological Reserve, located in Rio de Janeiro state, Brazil, in a stand of 2.16 hectares with an experimental restoration design established in the year 2000 to test tree species performance of different ecological groups. Methods: In 2020, we sampled trees with a diameter at breast height greater than 2.5 cm in 20 m × 20 m plots with four replicates per treatment and measured leaf, wood, and seed functional traits. Then, we estimated the diversity (functional and taxonomic richness), functional composition, and vegetation structure of natural regeneration, compared them between treatments, and tested which traits of the planted community influenced them. Results: Natural regeneration exhibited significant differences between treatments, particularly regarding the diversity dimension (functional and taxonomic) and vegetation structure (basal area and abundance). Wood density, leaf phosphorus content, and leaf C:N ratio of the planted species were associated with natural regeneration (functional composition, diversity, and vegetation structure). Conclusions: Priority effects in conservative tree planting communities affect natural regeneration, while functional convergence observed in acquisitive planting communities suggests the role of environmental filtering. Communities with low wood density, low C:N ratio, and high specific leaf area, which characterize an acquisitive resource-use strategy, exhibited higher functional and taxonomic diversity of natural regeneration, leading to the desired trajectory in ecological restoration. © 2024 International Association for Vegetation Science.

AB  - Chile is a global biodiversity hotspot and hosts a large proportion of the southern hemisphere's temperate forests. The Chilean Valdivian temperate forest is a vulnerable ecosystem containing a highly ecologically valuable species assemblage. Productive forest plantations have involved deforestation of, and alien species introduction into, this ecosystem. This process has already severely impacted the western part of Chile (the Coastal Range) and is now occurring in the eastern part (the Andes), with forestry plantations promoted by government subsidies between 1974 and 2012. Archive Landsat satellite imagery classification and Google Earth Engine are used to assess land cover change over a 31-year period with a focus on alien species (Pinaceae and Eucalyptus spp.) spread and native (Nothofagus spp. and Araucaria araucana) deforestation. Results show a clear land cover pattern based on elevation: a higher altitude, relatively undisturbed area dominated by native forest (the Andes), and a lower altitude area where most human activity and related land covers are located (the valley area). The valley is highly dynamic because of constant land cover change due to forestry. Overall, Araucaria araucana cover has decreased over the study period, while Nothofagus spp. has remained relatively stable. Alien Pinaceae has decreased, while Eucalyptus spp. has remained stable. However, the results indicate that change analysis over long periods conceal dynamism. For example, Eucalyptus spp. sharply decreased between the 1980s and the 1990s and surged afterwards. Also, even though Nothofagus spp. cover dominates throughout the study period, change analysis shows a high degree of change in the valley area, indicating newly established Nothofagus spp. patches. Over the study period, long rotation Pinaceae plantations for timber have given way to shorter rotation forestry (alien Eucalyptus spp., native Nothofagus spp.) for pulp and local uses resulting from discontinuation of forest subsidies. In the absence of subsidies, only large-scale plantations can engage in long rotation forestry, as smallholders need the more stable income provided by shorter rotation forestry. Although higher elevations (the Andes) are dominated by native forest, several abandoned alien forest plantations may be the source of biological invasion. In addition, native forest degradation as a result of Araucaria araucana loss and shrub encroachment is occurring. Earth observation methods are key for forest and alien species monitoring and landscape management. They can enhance traditional, ground-based forest surveys and provide continuous and even retrospective monitoring of forest change thanks to the wide availability of current and historical satellite data. © 2024 The Authors

AB  - Seed dispersal is fundamental to tropical forest resilience. Forest loss or degradation typically leads to defaunation, altering seed transfer dynamics and impairing the ability of forested habitats to regenerate or recover from perturbation. However, the extent of defaunation, and its likely impacts on the seed dispersers needed to restore highly degraded or clear-felled areas, remains poorly understood in tropical forest landscapes. To quantify defaunation of seed-dispersing birds, we used field survey data from 499 transects in three forested regions of Brazil, first comparing the observed assemblages with those predicted by geographic range maps, and then assessing habitat associations of frugivores across land cover gradients. We found that current bird assemblages have lower functional diversity (FD) than predicted by species range maps in Amazonia (4%–6%), with a greater reduction in FD (28%) for the Atlantic Forest, which has been more heavily deforested for a longer period. Direct measures of seed dispersal are difficult to obtain, so we focused on potential seed transfer inferred from shared species occurrence. Of 83 predominantly frugivorous bird species recorded in relatively intact forests, we show that 10% were absent from degraded forest, and 57% absent from the surrounding matrix of agricultural land covers, including many large-gaped species. Of 112 frugivorous species using degraded forest, 47% were absent from matrix habitats. Overall, frugivores occurring in both intact forest and matrix habitats were outnumbered by (mostly small-gaped) frugivores occurring in both degraded forest and matrix habitats (23 additional species; 64% higher diversity). These findings suggest that birds have the potential to disperse seeds from intact and degraded forest to adjacent cleared lands, but that direct seed transfer from intact forests is limited, particularly for large-seeded trees. Degraded forests may play a vital role in supporting natural regeneration of small-seeded tree species as well as providing a ‘stepping-stone’ in the regeneration pathway for large-seeded trees. We propose that both intact and degraded forests will support the restoration potential of tropical forest landscapes, and that bird-assisted seed dispersal can be enhanced by maintaining buffer zones of degraded or secondary forests around remaining intact forest patches.

AB  - The Atlantic Forest is one of the most biodiverse Brazilian biomes and has also been the most impacted by anthropogenic activities, leading to fragmentation of its remnants in different stages of succession. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the floristic and structural composition of the tree and regenerating strata in three different Atlantic Forest remnants located in the state of Espírito Santo. All living tree individuals with diameter at breast height (DBH at 1.30 m) ≥5 cm were sampled, and phytosociological, entropy and evenness parameters were obtained. In the regenerating stratum, 45 sample units with dimensions of 5 × 5 m were established. Inclusion criteria were a minimum height of 50 cm and DBH< 5 cm. Phytosociological parameters, Shannon diversity index, Pielou’s evenness, as well as structure and floristic composition similarities among fragments, were obtained for both strata. Indicator Species Analysis (ISA) was performed to identify indicator species, and cluster analysis was conducted among sample units, along with NMDS to assess the homogeneity of groups. In both the tree and regenerating strata, disturbed fragments (F1 and F2) exhibited lower species richness and diversity, with a predominance of early secondary species. The older stand (F3) showed a predominance of late successional species, indicating more advanced vegetation conditions compared to the other two evaluated fragments. The families Fabaceae and Myrtaceae were more abundant and species-rich in both strata. Regarding the ISA for each fragment in the studied strata, there were observed changes in species composition in the regenerating stratum, suggesting a possible future shift in stand composition. Additionally, it was concluded that regeneration played a significant role in indicating possible successional advances and forest recovery. © 2024 Gebrüder Borntraeger.

AB  - Proximal sensors provide fast, low-cost, environmentally friendly, and reliable analyses for the characterization of soils and other materials. Numerous studies have been conducted on soils in temperate regions, but there are knowledge gaps regarding the use of these devices in tropical soils, especially in the Amazon region. In this regard, this study utilized portable proximal sensors of X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (pXRF) and diffuse reflectance spectroscopy in the visible to near-infrared region (Vis-NIR) for predicting the texture of natural soils in 61 municipalities in the state of Pará, Amazon region, Brazil. The objectives were: i) to investigate the accuracy of soil texture prediction based on data from sensors separately and sensor fusion (pXRF and Vis-NIR data) using two supervised algorithms (Random Forest, RF, and Support Vector Machine, SVM) and ii) to assess the effect of soil horizon (superficial and subsuperficial horizons, and their combination) in predicting the texture of tropical natural soils. In total, 233 soil samples were collected in the 0–20 cm and 80–100 cm depths, equivalent to superficial and subsuperficial horizons in areas with primary or secondary forest cover with at least 20 years of natural regeneration and approximately 20 ha of coverage area. The hydrometer method was used for soil texture analysis. In parallel, a portion of the soil samples was analyzed by pXRF and Vis-NIR, in triplicate, under laboratory conditions. The predictive models with RF were more robust compared to the models obtained with SVM, according to ratio performance interquartile distance (RPIQ), coefficient of determination (R2), root mean square error (RMSE), and mean absolute error (MAE). The R2 values obtained by pXRF, Vis-NIR, and sensor data combination were, respectively, 0.89, 0.87, and 0.93 for sand; 0.92, 0.90, and 0.93 for clay; and 0.91, 0.67, and 0.93 for silt. Overall, clay prediction models achieved higher R2 values compared to sand and silt models. Soil texture prediction using sensor fusion showed lower RMSE values and higher R2 and RPIQ values, respectively (sand: 7.79, 0.93, 4.69; clay: 5.58, 0.93, 3.86; and silt: 5.72, 0.92, 2.92) compared to the best-performing sensor individually (Vis-NIR). With regard to the optimal model utilizing individual sensor data, Vis-NIR models exhibited reduced error for clay and sand prediction. The effect of combining horizons to a single and bigger dataset was minimally important for the models. The results demonstrate confidence in the use of proximal sensors for soil texture assessment in natural Amazon soils, aiming to reduce costs and the time required for analyses. © 2023

AB  - Dry forests are one of the most threatened ecosystems in the world, and they are poorly protected. The semiarid region of northeastern Brazil is the largest area in the New World with a predominance of dry forests, although it has been estimated that half of Brazil’s original semiarid vegetation has already been removed. This study assesses the extent of changes in areas covered by native dry forests (Caatinga) over a period of 46 years (1973–2019) in the southern portion of the semiarid region in Brazil’s State of Bahia. The study area encompasses 18 municipalities (counties) with a total area 2,344,733 ha. To map changes in vegetation cover, Landsat satellite images were used for the years 1973, 1987, 2001, and 2019. The area with native vegetation was reduced by 614,100 ha between 1973 and 2019. The area with vegetation declined in all municipalities; however, the intensity of changes in land use varied among the analyzed periods, with 77.1% of the reduction in vegetation cover occurring between 1973 and 1987. In the 1990s, the intensity of cutting of native vegetation decreased, mainly due to a decrease in the area planted to cotton, while natural regeneration increased. Cutting native vegetation resumed in the 2000s while regeneration declined. In 2019, the remaining vegetation was almost completely restricted to hills or mountains and was in fragments composed of a mosaic of vegetation in different stages of regeneration. Areas that still have native vegetation must be preserved, including those that are regenerating from past clearing. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2024.

AB  - Reduced-impact logging is a key aspect of sustainable forest management in the Brazilian Amazon. Real Options Analysis (ROA) improves the evaluation of certified projects, increases their value, and supports investor confidence. This study evaluates the economic viability of a forest management investment project in certified areas of the Brazilian Amazon, using ROA to incorporate uncertainty and managerial flexibility into the decision-making process. The analysis focused on an Ombrophilous Dense Forest in its first cutting cycle, with 30 species of diameter at breast height ≥ 50 cm and a projected activity period of 30 years. Timber value was modeled using the mean reversion motion, and a binomial decision model was applied, incorporating options such as deferral, abandonment, and interruption. The deferral option should be exercised with a 100% probability, both in the joint calculation scenario and in separate analyses, highlighting the significant value of this managerial flexibility. In addition, when analyzed using ROA, the value of the project increased by 105% (USD 91,784,176) compared to the traditional net present value approach. The forest management investment project in the Brazilian Amazon is economically viable and the application of ROA reveals significant value added, demonstrating the importance of incorporating flexibility into investment decisions. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - Nature-based solutions (NbS) to water scarcity, environmental degradation, climate change, and biodiversity losses are enjoying increasing implementation throughout the world. This manuscript reviews three case studies from Brazil, Panama, and Portugal that illustrate NbS and searches for commonalities that may assist their usefulness in new sites. The Tijuca Forest in Rio de Janeiro is a remarkable story of centuries of forest management and restoration that initially aimed at providing water security for the capital of the country during the XIX Century while it was still a monarchy. Today, it is recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The Panama Canal Watershed produces water for canal operations, electricity generation, and drinking water for half the country’s population. Traditional water mills and weirs near streams in the Alentejo Region, Portugal, have largely been abandoned due to the damming of the Guadiana River. Yet today, weirs are increasingly recognized for their important contribution to water provisioning in this dry region. All have a primary goal related to water provisioning, yet their ecosystem benefits are multiple. The cases offer important lessons for adaptation to climate change, cultural benefits from traditional human activities, and concerns about social equity. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - Extreme drought events have become increasingly frequent in the Amazon, with uncertainty about the response of vegetation. To monitor the impact of climate change on the Amazon biota, the Drought Study Project (ESECAFLOR) was implemented in the state of Pará in 2021, which simulates an artificial reduction in precipitation and its consequences, physical and biological processes. The objective of this study was to compare the impact of reducing water availability on the forest floor on the density of individuals, number and composition of plant species from natural regeneration in the years 2010, 2017 and 2022. Vegetation sampling was carried out with plots between the two areas control and experimental (where there is a 50% reduction in precipitation). In the plots, all individuals up to 20 cm tall were identified and classified according to their form of life as shrubs, trees, palm trees, lianas and herbs. Soil moisture data was recorded at 20 cm above the ground in both areas. Soil moisture was higher in the control plot. There was a reduction in the abundance of individuals and the number of species in the experimental plot. Shrubs, trees, lianas and herbs had a reduction in the abundance of individuals in the experimental plot. The only form of life with an increase in individuals in the experimental plot were palm trees. There was no variation in the species composition between the control and experimental plots in 2010, however, there were significant differences in the species composition between the plots in the years 2017 and 2022. Artificial water stress has a profound impact on the decrease in the abundance of individuals and richness of species from natural regeneration, in addition to causing a drastic change in the composition of species in the experimental plot, corroborating climate models that predict that the decrease in rainfall in the Amazon could transform it into another type of vegetation, drier, with lower biomass, with fewer species. © 2025, Universidade Federal de Pernambuco.

AB  - Despite the socioeconomic importance of erva-mate (Ilex paraguariensis) traditional agroforestry production for family agriculture in Southern Brazil, there has been no systematization of forest management best practices aiming at long-term sustainability. Here, I present an analysis of relevant forest characteristics that are combined with restoration and management best practices to maintain not only sustainable traditional erva-mate production but also a healthy forest environment. Additionally, I developed a framework that offers an easy tool to apply a focused analysis of general forest attributes to help determine best practices for forest restoration, species diversification, and overall sustainability and health of agroforestry systems. This study also demonstrates that the integration of knowledge and practices that small-scale farmers and traditional communities have been developing for generations should be leveraged for more inclusive research and extension, especially considering the threats family farming is facing due to the dominant paradigm of conventional, one-size-fits-all agriculture. © 2023 by the author.

AB  - Studies on land-use and land-cover change patterns contribute to better informed management decisions for the conservation and restoration of Atlantic Forest fragments and their megabiodiversity. In recent decades, the phenomenon of forest transition has been observed in several parts of the biome, including in highly urbanized and metropolitan areas such as Campinas, in the state of São Paulo. Here, we examine land-use and land-cover change (using MapBiomas data with 30 m spatial resolution) within the Campinas Environmental Protection Area, where natural forest cover increased from 9% to 17.1% of the total area between 1985 and 2023. Exogenous socioeconomic factors, including the gradual replacement of agricultural activities by tourism development and the designation of areas through successive ecological–economic zonings, are presented as possible causes of the decrease in deforestation and the stabilization and recovery of the remaining natural forest cover. Our analysis reaffirms evidence from other studies showing that secondary succession in abandoned pastures contributed to the forest transition process identified in the region. Strongly decreasing trends were identified for pasture areas and strongly increasing trends for forest formations and urban infrastructure. Based on analysis of forest formation transitions conducted at 5-year intervals between 1985 and 2020, we observed different patterns of net change between the local, regional, and macroregional levels and the state and biome levels. Our analysis of land-use and land-cover transitions for the most recent years (2018 to 2023), including the period of validity of the EPA Management Plan, indicates that the ecological–economic zoning instrument is effective in containing potential threats; however, it has limitations, since losses of forest formation were observed in all five conservation zones. We emphasize that, although we can attest to the effectiveness of ecological–economic zoning, which in the EPA region has undergone incremental adaptations favorable to the forest transition process, this management instrument is subject to changes in its limits and regulations based on the governance system established at its different levels. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - The ecological restoration of pastures is a complex process, as these sites may suffer from degraded soil quality and reduced abundance and diversity of invertebrates. Nevertheless, their restoration can contribute to the return of essential ecosystem services, making them an important research area. To better understand the initial process of soil restoration in tropical pastures, we examined soil microbial activity, litter invertebrate abundance and species richness across a land-use gradient in southeastern Brazil. This gradient included a pasture in continuous use (PCU), three 5-year-old moderately assisted recovery (MAR) and unassisted natural recovery (UNR) pastures, and a reference forest (REF). We hypothesized that, owing to soil preparation and enhanced structural complexity, MAR (planted) sites would exhibit higher microbial activity and support a more diverse and abundant invertebrate population than UNR (naturally regenerating) sites. We also predicted that the MAR and REF sites would foster higher soil quality, tree species richness, and tree abundance, accounting for most of the variation in microbial activity and litter invertebrates. Contrary to our hypotheses, the UNR sites showed slightly better levels of microbial activity than the MAR sites, and PCU exhibited the highest levels of microbial biomass carbon, microbial respiration, and β-glucosidase. The MAR and UNR sites were similar in terms of invertebrate abundance and richness, both showing total abundance and taxonomic group numbers comparable to those of REF. We found no correlation between microbial activity and vegetation or soil quality. Only Thysanoptera and Hemiptera invertebrate groups showed a weak association with litter production and soil quality. Our findings suggest that site preparation for tree planting, which is indispensable for areas lacking natural regeneration potential, appears to temporarily disrupt the soil conditions. This implies a longer recovery period for the microbial activity. However, this is not a drawback of tree planting but rather an integral part of the process that contributes to long-term ecosystem restoration. Vegetation variables and general soil quality may have an indirect effect on microbial activity and litter invertebrates. It would be beneficial to consider additional variables to gain a more comprehensive understanding of these interactions. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This note reports the nesting of M. semitorquatus inside a human construction, adding new data on its breeding behavior and diet at the southern limit of its distribution. The study area is located in southern Brazil, about 3 km from Turvo State Park, one of the most important protected areas in southern Brazil. The area is near the Uruguay River, in the municipality of Barra do Guarita, in the northwest region of the state of Rio Grande do Sul. The nest was made inside a human building on an abandoned farm surrounded by a fragmented landscape of forest fragments and cultivated areas. The nest was being used by a female, still incubating the eggs. After the breeding period, and once the adult and young birds left the nest, five pellets and alimentary remains were collected. The alimentary remains found in the nest were composed of bird species, rodents, and a lizard species. Among the birds, we identified three new prey species for the Collared Forest-Falcon: Patagioenas picazuro, Furnarius rufus, and Turdus sp. Therefore, we show that anthropic constructions can be used as alternative nesting sites for this species, which likely foraged in open or agricultural landscapes. These observations demonstrate that the Collared Forest-Falcon has some tolerance to modified environments, an important aspect for its conservation. © 2024 Fundacion Miguel Lillo.

AB  - Natural regeneration after mining activities depends largely on the soil seed bank (SSB) and aboveground vegetation (AGV) richness and composition. We evaluated the species diversity pattern of the SSB and AGV on soil and technosol across second-growth Atlantic Forests (SGFs) after mining tailings deposition in Mariana, southeastern Brazil. Two second-growth Atlantic seasonal semideciduous forests of different stand ages were selected: a 3-year-old stand of SGF re-growing on tailings (SGF tailings) and a 30-year-old stand of native reference forest not affected by tailings (SGF nontailings). Overall, the results showed significant differences in forest attributes (species richness and composition) in the SSB and AGV between the two forest patches evaluated (SGF tailings and SGF nontailings). Moreover, both nonzoochoric and zoochoric dispersed species of AGV showed significant differences between second-growth forests, with higher variability of community-weighted mean in SGF tailings. The result shows smaller differences in species richness between forest types for both SBB (ranging 85 and 90 species) and AGV (~55 species). Despite the time difference between the secondary forest and the absence of zoochoric species in the tailings seed bank, the AGV that are re-growing on mining tailings presented a high proportion of zoochoric species. This pattern of species richness and community composition variability observed in the technosol seed bank, and AGV that are re-growing after the deposition of mining tailings are important recovery indicators for plant communities affected. © 2024 The Ecological Society of Japan.

AB  - The mining and metallurgical industry sector activities often release potential toxic elements (PTE) surrounding exploitation area. We evaluated the addition of phosphate and lime using the dosage of 0.5:1, 1:1, and 2:1 molar ratio of PO43- and CO32- to the sum of PTE, respectively, and also, biochar and biosolids using the dosage of 2.5, 5, and 10% (m:m) to immobilize PTE in contaminated forest soil (Pb (270 mg kg-1) and Zn (858 mg kg-1)) near an abandoned mine site in Brazil. The desorption by stirred flow kinetics revealed that 15% of the total Zn and 12% Pb contents are mobile before any amendment application. Phosphate amendment decreased Pb desorption but increased Zn desorption. Biochar and biosolids immobilize high amounts of Zn and Pb because of their high cation exchange capacities and alkaline properties; however, 20% biosolid dose increased Pb desorption. X-ray absorption spectroscopy suggested Zn-kerolite as the major species in the contaminated soil, likely from mine dust. The change in Zn speciation after soil amendment addition indicated that biochar and lime kept a high proportion of Zn-Al species, whereas phosphate and biosolids led to more Zn-Fe species. Our results pointed out that lime might reduce both Pb and Zn mobilities; however, field trials are crucial to confirm the immobilization efficiency of lime and other amendments over long term. © 2023.

AB  - Restinga forests are one of the most threatened coastal ecosystems associated with the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. As there have been very few studies of the regeneration of those forest remnants, and their many different regeneration times, we examined the composition and structure of species in both conserved and disturbed Restinga forest sites within a conservation area on the eastern coast of Rio de Janeiro State, Brazil. Surveys of shrub/tree species were undertaken in 80 plots (25 m²) in which all woody plants were tagged, identified, measured (diameter and height), and their regrowth capacity (from roots and/or stems) evaluated. We classified the species according to their growth habits and dispersal syndromes. Comparisons of the conserved and disturbed areas were made based on phytosociological parameters. We encountered 104 species occurring exclusively in the conserved area and 45 species occurring exclusively in the disturbed area. Only thirteen species were shared by both areas (low floristic similarity), although those showed divergent tree canopy growth parameters. We identified strong differences in the floristic and structural components of disturbed and conserved areas, indicating the high conservation relevance of the latter. Our results evidence the low resilience to disturbance of Restinga forests, even considering the contiguity between conserved and disturbed areas. Species common to both areas evidenced diverse functional traits (fast-growing, zoochorous, resprouters, N2-fixing traits) valuable to ecological restoration activities. These findings may assist policymakers in developing efficient restoration and conservation strategies for this forest type. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - Pinus plantation forestry in South America has expanded quickly and assumed a significant portion of land use, including in urban arborization. This invasive alien genus changes the plant community, resulting in a loss of biodiversity, and environmental issues that require public policy actions. Here, we applied dendrochronology to assess ecological growth dynamics and micro and macro scale climate effects on an abandoned Pinus elliottii trees in urban forest fragments, and provide insights into the management for public policies. We constructed a robust 41-year (1978 – 2019) chronology that showed r = 0.63, rbar = 0.47, and EPS = 0.92 with an average annual growth rate of 7.10 mm/year. Modeling tree growth of diameter, height and volume of P. elliottii based on tree-ring analysis, we assessed the average diameter without bark (42.37 cm) and height (19 m). The growth rates in the early years evidence pioneer behavior, representing rapid sexual maturity. The volume growth model indicates an average individual volume of 1.23 m³, with maximum productivity at 16 years when the current annual volume increment peaks. This age corresponds to a diameter of 32 cm, which would be an appropriate minimum logging diameter to wood destined for a sawmill. Volumetric increment rates highlight the potential trade-in forestry sector and application in public policies that aim to control and manage P. elliotti. We evidence significant climatic signals, but with moderate influence on the variability of growth. For the local climatic variables, there was a positive influence of warm and humid summer and late spring, during the previous and current growth seasons. Furthermore, considering global climatic factors, there was only a positive influence of the Annual Southern Oscillation Index for June, representing a positive correlation for dry and cold early winter, influenced by La Niña events. This work provides an understanding of the biological growth of P. elliotti in urban forest fragments and opens a perspective to assist public policies in managing the invasion of Pinus spp. linked to the forest trade. © 2023 Elsevier GmbH

AB  - With large tracts of Tropical Dry Forests (TDF) in the Americas previously deforested, many places are currently undergoing secondary ecological succession. These processes vary in time and space, creating a landscape with forests of different ages or successional stages. These secondary forests need moreneed more understanding about how their ecosystem functionality is restored and recovering along the succession path. In particular, it is poorly understood how different successional stages moderate extremes of Essential Climatic Variables (ECV) such as temperature, relative humidity, soil moisture, and the fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetic Active Radiation (fAPAR). This paper, therefore, studies the linkages between high temporal resolution tower-based optical canopy phenology time series and seasonal changes in local ECV conditions between early (10–12 years) and late (50+ years) successional stage TDF in southeastern Brazil. We compare diurnal and seasonal patterns of understory ECVs between early/late plots and investigate the canopy's Climate Moderating Capacity (CMC). Our data indicate at least 100 mm of precipitation within two weeks is necessary to initiate leaf flushing in this TDF. We also find that soil moisture and daytime air humidity strongly correlate (R2 > 0.75) with seasonal patterns in canopy vegetation greenness indices and fAPAR with a cross-correlation time lag peak of 12–15 days. Our results suggest that the late stage is more effective at cooling (−1.4 ± 0.6 °C vs −0.8 ± 0.6 °C) and reducing daytime evaporation (−0.41 ± 0.2 kPa vs −0.18 ± 0.12 °C) in the understory during the growing season than the early stage. Results suggest that the CMC varies with seasonal canopy leaf area dynamics and with heat and moisture scales, becoming significantly stronger when temperatures and vapour pressure deficits were highest, and correlated strongly with canopy fAPAR dynamics (R2 = 0.82). These findings demonstrate that TDFs can effectively regain microclimatic buffering capacity. © 2024 The Authors

AB  - The Cerrado region comprises the world's most biodiverse savanna and the largest cultivated pastures for cattle in Brazil. Forty percent of these pastures are unproductive or degraded, with bare soil and native vegetation increasingly replacing exotic forage grasses. This study sought to investigate the regeneration of native vegetation in the pastures of the Cerrado and to evaluate the contribution of biophysical, land management, and landscape attributes to this process. Across the Cerrado, we analyzed pasture plant communities and the attributes of pasture management intensification, fire events, landscape native vegetation cover, and climate and soil types of 93 active pastures and 15 abandoned pastures. For the abandoned pastures, time since abandonment was an additional variable. On actively cultivated pastures, savanna regeneration varied from 0 to 70%, with a diversity of herbs and woody species. Pasture management was the main predictor of savanna regeneration on cultivated pastures. On abandoned pastures, time since abandonment was the main predictor. Exotic grass cover had a strong negative relationship with savanna regeneration and they were present even in pastures abandoned for 44 years. Our study reveals the potential of natural regeneration of the Cerrado and its particular predictors. The occurrence of pastures with high natural regeneration indicates that national policies can promote native vegetation restoration and silvopastoral systems with predictable, low cost implementation. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Forest landscape restoration (FLR) is the intentional intervention in the forest landscape to recover biological diversity and ecosystem functions, improving human well-being in altered landscapes. The general objective of the present study was to understand the state of the art of research that potentially contributes to FLR practices in the Amazon. We carried out a comprehensive literature review using the Web of Science platform, considering papers published between 2000 and 2020 to understand the state of knowledge on restoration strategies that support FLR in the nine Amazonian countries and the nine states of the Brazilian Amazon. We selected 362 articles that met our inclusion criteria after analyzing 1,205 articles. We found that Brazil, followed by Peru, Colombia, and Ecuador, has the largest number of published articles on FLR. Agroforestry (37.88%) and natural regeneration (30.35%) were the most common FLR strategies across all countries and Brazilian states. Most studies investigated ecological functioning (33%), vegetation structure (31%), and tree diversity (15.5%). Forest restoration strategies (forest plantation, natural regeneration, or silviculture) are reported in most studies (57.23%), in comparison to restoration strategies of agricultural lands (agroforestry systems or improved fallow; 42.77%). We found an increase in publications describing restoration strategies over time in the Amazon, especially from 2012 onwards, with a peak in 2018. Future studies in the Amazon region should address socioeconomic issues and expand the geographic scope within the Amazon, as well as the FLR strategies and the ecosystem attributes investigated. © 2023 Society for Ecological Restoration.

AB  - The world has entered the United Nations Decade on Ecosystem Restoration (2021–2030), yet many regions of the world still face environmental degradation. In this context a question arises: under what conditions may a given region shift from a trajectory of environmental degradation to environmental recovery? Answering this question constitutes an important endeavor for the scientific community, policymakers, and organizations leading the planning and implementation of restoration projects. This study examines some of the human-environment conditions underpinning the net gains in natural forest cover in a region that has experienced environmental degradation: the Atlantic Forest biome, Brazil. Using land-use/cover (LULC) data, we assessed the loss and successive gain in forest cover during the 1987–2001 and 2001–2015 periods. Municipality-level statistics on agriculture and economy, together with LULC and biophysical data, were used to develop models for assessing forest cover trajectories. Of the 1,972 municipalities experiencing net forest loss during the 1987–2001 period, 59% shifted their trajectory to a net gain during the 2001–2015 period. This shift, known as forest transition, followed a complex socio-economic pathway characterized by (i) the stagnation of traditional agricultural activities favoring the replacement of pasturelands by mechanized agriculture, and (ii) the emergence of non-agricultural rural activities together with multifunctional landscapes. Furthermore, a trend of decrease in precipitation seems to be associated with land abandonment, thus, favoring the return of natural vegetation. Our findings suggest that forest transition at the biome level is possible if environmental and land regulations take advantage of specific context-dependent situations that foster net forest gains.

AB  - Severe defoliation of mangrove species is reported in several parts of the world. We analyzed the effect of a severe defoliation event resulting from the attack of a lepidopteran caterpillar (an insect outbreak) on the litterfall production. The attack occurred between 2009 and 2010 in a mangrove in southeastern Brazil. Leaf litter production by different mangrove species between 2008 and 2019, was considered in the analysis. The infestation directly affected the species Avicennia schaueriana Stapf & Leechm in all physiographic types assessed, with a decrease in leaf litter production between 43% and 86% since the monitoring began (2009) until the year when defoliation reached the maximum (2011). A decrease in the impact of defoliation was observed along the tidal flooding gradient, with more pronounced effects in forests located in the transition zone with the salt-flat, and progressive decrease towards fringe forests. In fringe and basin forests, leaf litter production by Laguncularia racemosa (L.) decreased between 52% and 67% between 2009 and 2011, respectively, and increased 30% in transition forests. Contrarily, the contribution of Rhizophora mangle (L.) increased 7% in basin, became noticeable in transition, and decreased by 25% in the fringe forests. The time required for A. schaueriana to recover the level of debris production was 8 years, and still reflect the effect of the severe, selective defoliation process on the dynamics and ecological succession of mangrove forests. A model that determines the stages of defoliation and their direct and indirect impacts on litter was developed. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Research highlights: Tropical forest restoration can be supported by the production of timber species in their understory. While they may appear at odds, they can be reconciled to promote environmental conservation and services. The lack of information on the management of tropical species causes a technical constraint for timber production in the understory of restoration sites, especially given the light restrictions. This issue could be amended with the development of methods to easily manage and estimate light availability, targeting management practices that balance restoration success and productivity. Materials and Methods: We conducted this study in an area within the Atlantic Forest, Brazil, where we tested the efficiency of chemical thinning to increase light availability in the understory of a five-year-old restoration planting, aiming to increase the growth rates of desirable timber species. Moreover, we tested the viability of using hemispherical photography taken with a smartphone to assess light incidence to assist restoration management practices. We calculated the percentage of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) using a ceptometer in four different thinning intensities and compared them to the smartphone measures using correlation analysis. Results: Chemical thinning increased light incidence in the understory, with potential impacts on timber species productivity. Light management through PAR and canopy opening were highly correlated overall, especially after three months of management and 60% of thinning intensity. Conclusions: These findings demonstrate the potential for chemical thinning as a management practice to enhance light availability in the understory of tropical forest restoration sites. Additionally, our study highlights the value of using affordable and accessible tools like smartphones and fisheye clips for the indirect assessment of light conditions to promote natural regeneration and guide forest management and timber production in tropical forest restoration. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Fire-resistant species may have an essential ecological role in the natural regeneration process of degraded landscapes. Moquiniastrum polymorphum is a ruderal and fire-resistant species that occupies fire-disturbed areas in Brazilian Atlantic Forest. Evaluating a species’ growth sensitivity to fire and climate can help understand its complex successional process. In the present study, we used dendrochronology to describe the radial growth trajectories of M. polymorphum in a fire-disturbed area in the Atlantic Forest (Poço das Anta Biological Reserve), detect post-fire effects on the species’ growth, and investigate climate-growth relationships. We described the long-term growth trend of the species, it increased in the first years and was constant in the following years. The chronology was positively correlated with precipitation and negatively correlated with temperature at the end of the rainy season. Our results reveal that M. polymorphum did not reduce its growth after fire events. When observing through an epoch perspective, fire can even be positive to the species growth. These growth results indicated species fire resistance, which likely provides a resilient tree cover after forest fires and allows disturbed Atlantic Forest environments to break grass-fire cycles. This resistance may have a direct relationship with the opportunistic characteristic of the species in fire-prone areas in the Atlantic Forest. However, we highlight the critical role this species plays in the natural regeneration of burned sites in the Atlantic Forest. © 2023 Elsevier GmbH

AB  - The initial performance of seedlings of tree species from different functional groups, regarding the growth-defense tradeoff, might determine its long-term success during the rehabilitation of mining areas. We monitored the field performance of six native tree species of the Atlantic Forest in the Fundão dam tailing that has been under rehabilitation for 35 months. Additionally, we explored the morphophysiological traits driving the superior performance of three species. The study examined the survival strategies of pioneer species (Anadenanthera colubrina, Bixa orellana, Peltophorum dubium) and secondary species (Cedrela fissilis, Handroanthus impetiginosus, Handroanthus serratifolius), as well as the photosynthetic, nutritional, and antioxidant metabolism of the successful species. Most species accumulated excessive Fe in their leaves, except for the pioneer species A. colubrina and P. dubium. However, the nutritional status of the plants, concerning leaf nutrient concentration, was adequate for their growth in the waste. The species A. colubrina, C. fissilis, and H. serratifolius exhibited poor physiological performance, primarily due to substrate compaction and excessive foliar metal concentrations. The successful performance of P. dubium was attributed to avoidance mechanisms, allowing a cost-effective growth-defense tradeoff, thus maintaining photosynthetic efficiency at the expense of energy investment in antioxidant protection. The excess Fe allocation in the photosynthetic tissues of B. orellana was linked to a greater investment in antioxidant metabolism, which was related to the protection of the photosynthetic machinery. The Fe hyperaccumulation in H. impetiginosus led to increased oxidative damage, which was mitigated by investments in tolerance mechanisms, including photosynthetic adjustments (stomatal limitation, non-photochemical energy dissipation), as well as the activation of the enzymatic antioxidant system. The persistence and success of the Atlantic Forest tree species were not related to their ecological successional classification. Instead, it was the different mechanisms of tolerance and avoidance that allowed both pioneer and secondary species to thrive in the impacted area. © 2025 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Extensive forest restoration is a key strategy to meet nature-based sustainable development goals and provide multiple social and environmental benefits1. Yet achieving forest restoration at scale requires cost-effective methods2. Tree planting in degraded landscapes is a popular but costly forest restoration method that often results in less biodiverse forests when compared to natural regeneration techniques under similar conditions3. Here we assess the current spatial distribution of pantropical natural forest (from 2000 to 2016) and use this to present a model of the potential for natural regeneration across tropical forested countries and biomes at a spatial resolution of 30 m. We estimate that an area of 215 million hectares—an area greater than the entire country of Mexico—has potential for natural forest regeneration, representing an above-ground carbon sequestration potential of 23.4 Gt C (range, 21.1–25.7 Gt) over 30 years. Five countries (Brazil, Indonesia, China, Mexico and Colombia) account for 52% of this estimated potential, showcasing the need for targeting restoration initiatives that leverage natural regeneration potential. Our results facilitate broader equitable decision-making processes that capitalize on the widespread opportunity for natural regeneration to help achieve national and global environmental agendas. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Given the seasonal climatic characteristics, forest fires in “cerrado” areas in Central Brazil are common and challenging to prevent. Despite fire being a plant stimulation factor, such as breaking seed dormancy, when it covers large areas or occurs very frequently, it can cause irreparable damage to nature. Prevention is difficult and costly, and there are no corrective action options other than waiting for natural regeneration, which is usually slow and, not infrequently, with permanent damage. Due to its physicochemical qualities acting in biological regulation processes, water has been considered the primary vehicle for propagating signals from homeopathic ingredients, as suggested by previous studies carried out with solvatochromic dyes. Therefore, such inputs could, in theory, be inserted into watercourses to stimulate the regeneration of the biome destroyed by fire. This hypothesis motivated this case study. A slow dispersion device was developed aiming at promoting continuous environmental regeneration, containing hydrocolloid and calcium carbonate as a solid base soaked in a homeopathic complex specifically designed for this purpose, composed of Arnica montana 30 cH, Phosphorus 30 cH, Arsenicum album 30 cH, Staphysagria 30 cH, Ignatia amara 30 cH. The case occurred in Nascentes do Rio Taquari State Park (PENT), between Mato Grosso and Mato Grosso do Sul state, Brazil. It is a “cerrado” area, with multiple springs that feed the Paraguay River, occupying an area of 26,849 hectares over the Guarani and Bauru aquifers. After the fire in early September 2020, the devices were fixed at 9 strategic points in the park (P1 to P9) over 10 days, between September 29 and October 11, 2020, in water courses close to the main springs. The points varied from 400 to 800 m (altitude); all points were covered by native / recovered vegetation, but five were near agricultural fields. Two (P2 and P4) were located less than 400m from a highly vulnerable impact zone for burning. To assess the restoration signs of the post-fire environment, the IMASUL technicians responsible for monitoring the park registered the regrowth occurrence of new and known species of the flora in different locations close to four device-insertion points (P3, P5, P7, P8). Signs of recovery were observed 40 days after the fire was over. A rapid pioneer plant restructuring was noted, with a significant regrowth of grass, herbaceous and shrub species, such as Mutamba (Guazuma ulmifolia), Murici (Byrsonima spp.), Inga (Inga sp.), Brachiaria (Brachiaria sp.), Jaraguá grass (Hyparrhenia rufa), Colonião grass (Panicum maximum), Gabiroba (Campomanesia sp.), and Pixirica (Miconia sp.). Some species, such as Mimosa (Mimosa sp.), Colonião grass (Panicum maximum), and Jaraguá grass (Hyparrhenia rufa), were not detected in the area before the fire, probably by the seed bank stimulation caused by the heat. There was rapid forest regeneration (4 months after the fire) concerning the historical Brazilian forest natural post-fire recovery time [1], whose average for complete restoration is five to ten years, depending on the biome and the damage degree. The restoration of most of the burned trees was also noted, both for resisting the fire and for being free of invasive species highly aggressive to native plants, which were controlled by the action of fire. Concerning the fauna recovery, new bird visual observations were periodically observed, highlighting the appearance of “Tuiuiú” (Jabiru mycteria) and “Socó” (Tigrisoma lineatum) close to a water body with a waterfall area (P3). Both species belong to the “Pantanal” biome close to the park. Such species began to frequent the park's lakes, being observed until February 2023 (the last survey date). The park's inventory of lichens and fungi showed an unusual tolerance to fire in species that adhered to burned trees and remained active. In this way, although there is no clear cause-effect relation in this case report, it is suggested that installing slow dispersion devices in watercourses can contribute to the regeneration of other “cerrado” biome areas subjected to fire, protecting the local biodiversity. More studies of this nature are needed to know the real impact of this method on the recovery of different biomes. © International Journal of High Dilution Research.

AB  - The Seasonally Dry Tropical Forests (SDTF), distributed from Mexico to northern Argentina, are habitat to a unique biodiversity. Among these forests, the Caatinga stands out, occupying a large part of the Brazilian Northeast and is subject to cycles of anthropic disturbance and abandonment of exploited areas. Understanding how microbial communities respond to environmental changes is crucial, especially considering the various ecosystem services provided by microorganisms. Among soil microorganisms, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) play a significant role in the maintenance of terrestrial ecosystems. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the structure, composition, and distribution of AMF assemblages, as well as their main drivers, in regeneration areas of the Caatinga. Soil samples were collected in the Catimbau National Park (Pernambuco State), including an old-growth forest representing undisturbed areas, and in early, intermediate, and late regeneration areas. The composition of AMF assemblages differed among regenerating areas and old-growth forest, but their distribution is not related and conditioned to plant assemblages. Instead, soil properties and rainfall are the main factors structuring these assemblages in SDTF. A total of 83 taxa of AMF were identified. Glomus and Acaulospora, which exhibit respectively ruderal and stress-tolerant life strategies were the most abundant genera. The highest number of unique AMF species was recorded in the old-growth forest, contrasting with the late regeneration areas which had the lowest number. The results showed that deterministic processes (soil and rainfall) are structuring the AMF assemblages in areas under regeneration process in SDTF. Plants and AMF do not recover simultaneously over the evaluated regeneration times. © 2024 Elsevier Masson SAS

AB  - Semideciduous Seasonal Forest is a phytophysiognomy of Atlantic Forest with high plant richness but low representativeness in few remnants areas in different successional stages. The assessment of the degree of conservation of those areas helps to indicate whether there is a need for taking strategies to favor forest succession. Thus, the aim of this study was to identify litterfall and its nutrient content, accumulated litter biomass on topsoil, leaf litter decomposition, and topsoil (0–10 cm) chemical attributes as possible indicators of successional stages in areas of Seasonally Semideciduous Forest. We collected available information in literature on CAPES Portal and Google Scholar (May/2021 to February/2022) for Pinheiral municipality, State of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, which were evaluated by multivariate analysis. Accumulated litter biomass, nutrient content (N, P, K) in total litterfall, pH and P availability in topsoil, leaf litter decomposition constant, and half-life time of leaf litter were the most sensitive attributes to indicate the successional stage in the study area, according to Principal Component Analysis. This multivariate analysis indicated that areas in early successional stage were associated with higher values of leaves contribution, half-life of leaf litterfall, contents of Ca and K in total litterfall, whereas areas in middle successional stage were associated with higher values of pH, total organic carbon, exchangeable Ca2+, K+, and Mg+, sum of bases and cation exchange capacity, and lower values of extractable acidity and exchangeable Al3+ in the topsoil. Areas in advanced stages of succession were associated to higher values of total litterfall and its nutrient content (N, K, Mg), accumulated litter biomass, available P in topsoil, and leaf litter decomposition constant. The Cluster multivariate analysis revealed that the areas in advanced successional stage presented high dissimilarity in relation to the areas in early and middle successional stage. © 2023

AB  - The Amazon Basin is experiencing large-scale land use conversion from primary forest to pasture. While several land cover datasets map cleared areas in the Amazon, the percent cover of woody vegetation (trees and shrubs) in cleared areas and its association with clearing age, soil type, and geology is poorly understood, despite its importance for carbon emissions, biodiversity, land–atmosphere interactions, and monitoring of pasture condition. We used temporal mixture analysis on Sentinel-2 imagery from 2019 to map woody vegetation cover on cleared areas in Rondônia, Brazil. Binary woody vegetation masks were generated at 10-m resolution using a threshold of the evergreen endmember, with an overall accuracy of 84%. The age of clearing for each pixel was calculated from MapBiomas (Sousa and Davis, Remote Sens Environ 247, 2020) with a 2019 base year. We find little evidence of large-scale abandonment of pasture: most (53%) of the cleared area in 2019 was “clean pasture” (< 10% woody vegetation cover), 34% was “dirty pasture” (10–90% woody vegetation cover), 10% was forest (90–100% woody vegetation cover), and 3% was early stage clearing (> 10% woody vegetation cover, cleared 1–5 years ago). Recently cleared areas (1–2 years) had high (60%) woody vegetation cover, woody vegetation cover decreased with pasture age, and older pastures (20–34 years) had consistently low woody vegetation cover (25% on average). The commonly observed decrease in greenness with increasing clearing age, which is sometimes interpreted as decreasing grass health, was due in part to decreasing woody vegetation cover as pastures were gradually cleared over a decade. These results suggest modifications to existing conceptual models that describe clearing as a rapid process with high rates of secondary growth. We found a gradual and semi-permanent clearing of woody vegetation and proposed a revised conceptual model of deforestation dynamics. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2024.

AB  - The structure and diversity of tropical vegetation are shaped by biotic and abiotic factors, which function as environmental filters affecting plant performance on different spatial and temporal scales. We compared soil (Ferrasols and Cambisols) conditions, vegetation structure and leaf traits (e.g., specific leaf area, polyphenols, and chlorophyll contents a/b and in total) in the early, intermediate and late successional stages of a tropical dry forest (TDF) in southeastern Brazil. For this purpose, we measured leaf traits of the most abundant species in the same 18 plots (50 × 20 m/six per successional stage) in 2009 and 2018. Our prediction is that tree species growing in early forests have a greater investment in conservative traits related to chemical defenses and tolerance to desiccation compared to late-stage tree species. We observed contrasting results when comparing the chronosequence differences in leaf traits both in 2009 and 2018 and the temporal changes along this period. Specific leaf area was lower than expected for all successional stages, while polyphenol content increased over time, contrary to other studies in TDFs. These results suggest that contrasting environmental factors such as soil conditions and light availability are responsible of the observed pattern. Total chlorophyll content did not change significantly, while the a/b chlorophyll ratio doubled in all successional stages, contrary to our prediction. Therefore, we suggest that the conservative–acquisitive spectrum in successional gradients of TDFs should be further investigated with time-series data for a better understanding of plant community assemblages. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - Collecting and transplanting wild seedlings and mature plants have been used in restoration projects to reduce costs and increase conservation of local genetic material. We review the published literature on restoration projects that used transplanted seedlings and mature plants for ecological restoration. Searching the Web of Science platform using five keywords for articles published in 1945–2023 resulted in 621 articles, with only 51 (9%) of them relevant to the topic. We categorized these 51 publications by ecosystem type, the number and growth forms of species, plant survival rate, as well as the time and cost of transplantation. Forests and wetlands were the most researched ecosystems, and most articles studied tropical forests and the southeastern region of Brazil. Nearly half of the studies (44%) used trees for transplantation, and 73% focused on only one species. In wetlands, mainly aquatic herbs were transplanted (38%). Survival was highest in wetlands (lakes) and lowest in temperate and tropical forests, regardless of the number of species or growth forms. Only three articles (7%) included costs or the time frame of the process of transplantation or monitoring. Despite having few published studies, this practice has high potential for the ecological restoration of tropical and temperate forests. Seedlings and adult plants from natural regeneration can be transplanted to complement or even replace conventional methods of planting nursery seedlings and direct sowing. © 2024 Society for Ecological Restoration.

AB  - The Household Life Cycle framework relates family demographic processes to land use-cover change, but also revealed limitations. We propose several modifications, featuring a focus on extended families instead of single households, to broaden the applicability to land use systems. In the process, we pay particular attention to temporal dynamics and the spatial distribution of families concerning demographic processes, going beyond fertility to focus on population distribution. To evaluate the extended family model’s explanatory value, we apply it to the Transamazon Highway region in Brazil. The analysis includes 330 families, which are often multi-generational and multi-sited, based on data from 402 lots (1997/8–2005). We present models for forest, secondary succession, annual crops, perennials and pasture. Explanatory variables feature nine demographic factors with five others controlling for exogenous forces. The findings show strong effects for family dynamics and spatial distribution variables in many equations. Time on lot (cohort effect), the complexity of family structure (age effect) and social integration into urban fabric (spatial effect) are demographic processes that deserve further attention in land use studies. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2024.

AB  - Background: Managed Caatinga forests in Northeast Brazil are an important source of wood products, however, successful regeneration and regrowth is important to guarantee sustainability in these forests. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the natural regeneration and forest regrowth ability of a Caatinga forest under varying clear-cut treatments, as well as to estimate the recovery time of stand parameters. Results: An experiment was set up in Petrolina, Pernambuco state, Brazil, comparing five clear-cut strip widths: 0, 40, 60, 80 and 100 meters. Forest inventory data was gathered before and eight years after harvesting in 19 plots of 10 x 40 m. Tree seedling regeneration (individuals with circumference at breast height < 6 cm and minimum height of 0.5 m) was also monitored in 5 x 5 m sub plots, before harvesting, one, three and eight years after harvesting. Conclusions: No influence of the clear-cut strip width on regeneration and forest regrowth ability was detected, with all treatments presenting similar growth and tree species diversity and similarity values. The estimated growth rates of the clear-cut plots were of 0.12 m2·ha-1·year-1 and 0.39 m3·ha-1·year-1 for basal area and volume, respectively, resulting in recovery times of 35 and 49 years, longer than the 15 years cycles generally adopted in Caatinga forest management plans. © 2023, Federal University of Lavras.

AB  - The study of temporal changes in riparian vegetation is essential for understanding the paths taken by the ecosystem during ecological succession. In order to evaluate the changes in floristic composition, structure, and dynamics of the arboreal vegetation in an area of Semideciduous Seasonal Alluvial Forest, we aim to understand the secondary succession that occurs in the Paraná River floodplain. Based on a study conducted 20 years ago, in the municipality of Batayporã, Mato Grosso do Sul, a re-sampling was carried out in the same area, using the same methodology. Phytosociological and ecological parameters between the two temporal samplings were collected and compared using Student's ‘t’ test, where it was possible to find statistically significant variations (p<0.05) in the vegetation structure. A total of 603 individuals were sampled, distributed among 51 species and grouped in 46 genera and 31 families. The analysis of the distribution of abundance and importance values (IV) of species visualized in the histogram indicated an expected pattern in forest communities, which is the substitution of early successional species for late successional species. For the successional categories, the comparison of IVs revealed higher values for secondary species in both surveys and changes in the positions of climax and pioneer species, directly influencing the IVs values of these categories for the zones. When compared to the result obtained in the previous study, a replacement of the IV values of pioneer species with climax and dead species is noted. The comparisons showed that this phytocoenosis is evolving to a mature successional stage, a result of the decrease in the main anthropic impacts in the area. The results obtained highlight the importance of temporal monitoring of forest areas to expand the understanding of the pathways of ecological succession in this type of environment and provide information to assist in biodiversity conservation. © 2023, Eduem - Editora da Universidade Estadual de Maringa.

AB  - Under continuous human disturbance, regeneration is the basis for biodiversity persistence and ecosystem service provision. In tropical dry forests, edaphic ecosystem engineering by biological soil crusts (biocrusts) could impact regeneration by influencing erosion control and soil water and nutrient fluxes, which impact landscape hydrology, geomorphology, and ecosystem functioning. This study investigated the effect of cyanobacteria-dominated biocrusts on water infiltration and aggregate stability in a human-modified landscape of the Caatinga dry forest (NE Brazil), a system characterized by high levels of forest degradation and increasing aridity. By trapping dust and swelling of cyanobacterial filaments, biocrusts can seal soil surfaces and slow down infiltration, which potentially induces erosion. To quantify hydraulic properties and erosion control, we used minidisc-infiltrometry, raindrop-simulation, and wet sieving at two sites with contrasting disturbance levels: an active cashew plantation and an abandoned field experiencing forest regeneration, both characterized by sandy soils. Under disturbance, biocrusts had a stronger negative impact on infiltration (reduction by 42% vs. 37% during regeneration), although biocrusts under regenerating conditions had the lowest absolute sorptivity (0.042 ± 0.02 cm s−1/2) and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity (0.0015 ± 0.0008 cm s−1), with a doubled water repellency. Biocrusts provided high soil aggregate stability although stability increased considerably with progression of biocrust succession (raindrop simulation disturbed: 0.19 ± 0.22 J vs. regenerating: 0.54 ± 0.22 J). The formation of stable aggregates by early successional biocrusts on sandy soils suggests protection of dry forest soils even on the worst land use/soil degradation scenario with a high soil erosion risk. Our results confirm that biocrusts covering bare interspaces between vascular plants in human-modified landscapes play an important role in surface water availability and erosion control. Biocrusts have the potential to reduce land degradation, but their associated ecosystem services like erosion protection, can be impaired by disturbance. Considering an average biocrust coverage of 8.1% of the Caatinga landscapes, further research should aim to quantify the contribution of biocrusts to forest recovery to fully understand the role they play in the functioning of this poorly explored ecosystem.

AB  - Arid and semiarid ecosystems display several environmental filters naturally restricting plant community composition. Such filters become more severe after some disturbance and may thus hamper the survival of young plants. The role of remnant trees in succession needs to be better understood to identify patterns and functional traits that might facilitate natural regeneration in drylands. This study evaluated the role of remnant trees in the succession process in the caatinga vegetation (Brazilian seasonally dry tropical forest), testing the effect of a typical tree, the juazeiro (Ziziphus joazeiro Mart.) in richness and abundance of seedlings in areas of abandoned pasture, in Northeastern Brazil. A perimeter was outlined around each plant (n = 20) with a diameter equivalent to each tree crown; all seedlings of woody species up to 0.5 m in height, within that perimeter, were collected and identified. Control areas with the same dimensions were delimited in adjacent locations (n = 20) without the influence of remnant trees, followed by the same data surveys. Mean species richness was of 7.8 ± 4.8 under the juazeiro canopies, compared to 2.3 ± 1.9 in the control areas. Species abundance was also greater under the presence of Z. joazeiro, with an average of 16.9 ± 4.8, against 4.1 ± 4.2 individuals in the controls. Among the abiotic factors evaluated, it is suggested that soil and air temperatures may show a greater influence on the recruitment of seedlings, benefiting natural regeneration under Z. joazeiro. Z. joazeiro ramnant trees appear to facilitate the natural regeneration of tropical drylands. We suggest considering the use of these plants as catalysts for the nucleation process in the restoration of the caatinga. © 2024 Elsevier Masson SAS

AB  - Most of Brazilian's remaining native vegetation occurs inside private properties. Therefore, the effectiveness of environmental policies is affected by landowner's decisions. Brazilian Native Vegetation Protection Law delimits riparian permanent preservation areas (RPA) defined according to stream and river widths. Restoration legal needs (the environmental debt or liability) can increase native cover in Brazil. However, costly ecological restoration may prevent small owners from doing that. For that matter, it is important to understand and know the socioeconomic variables behind the restoration debt in certain areas in Brazil. Thus, we aimed at analyzing distribution of environmental debt in these RPA and related it to the socio- economic condition of the municipalities. We found that most of Sao Paulo state has environmental debt within its RPA. High environmental debt in Sao Paulo state is associated with the agricultural sector. Some of these regions are wealth and restoration by total planting might be well applied for compliance with legislation. In other places, where environmental debt and poverty are high, assisted natural regeneration might be an efficient technique, along with agroforestry systems. Some regions where low environmental debt coincided with poverty, environmental compensation could play an important role in a policy mix for socially equitable conservation and restoration. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The Brazilian Caatinga is among the most diverse dry forests in the world, yet half of its original coverage has been degraded. Natural regeneration is influenced by climatic and edaphic conditions, as well as the existing adult stratum. Despite its significance, this process remains poorly understood in the Caatinga. Thus, our study aimed to analyze how anthropogenic disturbance, vegetation cover, and soil properties affect the regenerating stratum under different levels of Caatinga vegetation cover. The research was conducted in the driest region of Brazil. The selected sites represent low (Area I) and high (Area II) normalized difference vegetation index. Six vegetable plots (50 × 20 m each) were delimited to study adult stratum, and four vegetable plots (10 × 10 m each) to regeneration stratum. Topsoil was sampled in all vegetable plots. Our results reveal interactions between soil characteristics and the adult and regenerating strata. Area II exhibited higher diversity and a greater number of exclusive species, while Area I was dominated by species more resistant to limiting conditions, such as Aspidosperma pyrifolium Mart. & Zucc. The C and N content in the soil showed a positive and significant correlation with the diversity of the regenerating stratum. The data suggest that the area with less vegetation cover, richness, and diversity shows signs of desertification. © 2024 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - There are some protected areas of Atlantic Forest in Brazil. In this work, we provide a list of the bryophyte species in the Área de Proteção Ambiental Mestre Álvaro, which is in the metropolitan region of Vitória in Espírito Santo state. The vegetation type in the area is submontane and montane dense ombrophilous forest at different stages of natural regeneration. The area is surrounded and influenced by urban growth. We conducted a floristic survey of the bryophytes and found 189 species, including 34 new records for Espírito Santo state. A geographical analysis shows that 6 species are endemic to Brazil and 21 species are exclusive to the Atlantic Forest. We also analyzed the substrates and found a predominance of rupicolous species, followed by corticolous species. This study contributes to the knowledge of the bryophyte diversity in Espírito Santo, and we emphasize the need for research in conservation units, especially in areas under regeneration, since studies in places where the ecosystem is in the process of recovery can provide information on the effectiveness of conservation and environmental recovery strategies. © 2024 Instituto de Pesquisas Jardim Botanico do Rio de Janeiro.

AB  - Worldwide, important biodiversity hotspots have been threatened by land use change, placing several species at risk. Some gaps in environmental licensing system represent challenges for the nature conservation and should be further investigated. Far beyond conservation strategies, the process of legalizing land use of some countries urgently needs to be reviewed, especially in places that host biological megadiversity, such as the Atlantic Forest, southeastern Brazil. This is the first multiple case study that evaluates the use of ecological descriptors in environmental impact assessment involving vegetation in different successional stages of the Atlantic Forest. The methodology was divided into two steps, i) the selection of the reports in a public environmental agency of São Paulo State and ii) the assessment of ecological criteria inherent to the vegetation survey. This study verified a scarcity of reports presenting adequate ecological descriptors according to the law in their reports, which would improve the assessment of the natural environmental framework. Although ecological parameters appear in some reports, they do not show relevant information, even though for the characterization of the succession stages of the forest fragments, thus hiding important information and leaving aside a parameter that should be essential in the approval/disapproval of reports. Thus, we suggest that the data presented and accepted by the Public Environmental Agency of São Paulo, Brazil, did not adequately characterize the stages of ecological succession in the studied areas, thus putting some ecological patterns and processes at risk. This issue must be urgently reviewed so reports should show the real threats for biodiversity. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The main factors that favour the regeneration of native vegetation in two regions in southeast Brazil were evaluated over an approximate period of 30 years. Region 1 covers 5.2 million hectares and is situated in the northern and northeastern portions of São Paulo. Region 2, located in eastern São Paulo, is formed by the Paraíba do Sul River basin and spans over 1.4 million hectares. In 2016, the area of native forests in Region 1 accounted for 19.3% of the territory against 16.9% in 1988. In Region 2, forests expanded by 83%, from 250,000 to 455,000 hectares. However, while in Region 1, characterised by competition between agricultural crops, the forest gain was modest, in Region 2, marked by steep terrain and a decline in livestock activities, significant natural forest regeneration was favoured. Restoration of native forest vegetation in the state of São Paulo may vary significantly over regions. © 2024 Universidade de Brasilia. All rights reserved.

AB  - Biological invasions are complex scale-dependent processes. Metacommunity ecology provides the means to understand the effects of invasive species (IS) because it explicitly considers how local and regional processes interact to drive the three main components of biodiversity: alpha, beta, and gamma. White-popinac (Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit) is a widely distributed IS in regenerating forests in the Atlantic Forest (Brazil). White-popinac establishment results in a particular spatial occupancy as the species forms dense and homogeneous patches, instead of spreading individuals throughout invaded areas. Here we took advantage of this unique spatial configuration formed by fragments of native forest and their respective regenerating areas, partially occupied by patches of white-popinac, to investigate how local and regional dynamics of plant metacommunities and communities under natural regeneration are affected by white-popinac. We conducted replicated multi-strata surveys in 131 communities distributed among 29 metacommunities of regenerating forests that had different ages of white-popinac invasion. We found (i) Mirrored responses among local and regional scales: at both scales, native species richness decreased with the increase of invasion age, whereas IS richness increased; and (ii) β-diversity of native species decreased with the increase of invasion age, showing that time-advance of invasion led to a homogenizing effect. We also found evidence that the advance of white-popinac patches towards regenerating forests increases with time and proximity to the forest fragment, which likely had indirect effects on regenerating communities by reducing the size of the regenerating area. Our results indicate that the effects of white-popinac invasions on regenerating forests can be so vigorous that they propagate from the local to the regional scale, via a decrease in β-diversity. We reinforce the importance of considering multiscale approaches on assessing effects of white-popinac invasions. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.

AB  - Hedychium coronarium J.Koenig is a rhizomatous herbaceous species native to Asia and invasive in most states of Brazil. We aimed to evaluate the influence of H. coronarium on terrestrial herbaceous communities and natural regeneration of woody plants in a remnant of Alluvial Araucaria Forest in Curitiba-PR. The communities were sampled considering two treatments: (EC) high coverage of H. coronarium (>60%); (BC) low coverage of H. coronarium (<30%). Two communities were recorded: i) herbaceous vascular species (including subshrubs) and ii) seedlings of woody species between 15-130 cm height. In EC H. coronarium had an average cover of 78.06%, with only five native herbaceous species and 24 native woody species. The average cover of the invasive in BC was 6.29%, with 17 native herbaceous and 37 woody native species. The most representative native herbaceous was Christella dentata (Forssk.) Brownsey & Jermy, while among the woody species Myrcia selloi (Spreng.) N.Silveira stood out for its frequency and abundance. The abundance of woody plants in the EC was approximately four times less than in the BC, showing that the high density of H. coronarium negatively influences native plant communities. The high cover of the invasive species results in a decrease in species richness and the number of individuals in the communities, both herbaceous and woody regeneration. © 2024, Universidade Federal de Santa Maria.

AB  - Environmental legislation requires well-defined concepts, criteria, and indicators to support its effective implementation and provide legal security to the diverse stakeholders involved. The Native Vegetation Protection Law (NVPL) establishes the obligation to restore native vegetation in protected areas within rural properties. This federal law is regulated and implemented by each state through its own Environmental Compliance Program (Programa de Regularização Ambiental [PRA], in Portuguese). Landowners must register their land, indicate whether native vegetation needs to be restored (i.e. if there is an environmental debt), and submit a restoration plan to the state government for analysis, validation, and approval. Due to the high cost of forest restoration, natural regeneration has most likely become a viable strategy for Amazonian landowners to meet their environmental debts. However, according to disturbance intensity, frequency, and duration, natural regeneration will not always succeed. In this context, we analyzed the PRAs of the seven main Amazonian states to assess the status of their implementation, identify how natural regeneration is defined and approached in the law, and evaluate whether improvements in the law are needed to ensure effective restoration to accomplish the NVPL. © 2024 Society for Ecological Restoration.

AB  - There is good evidence that the results of a restoration program depend largely on the landscape context. In restoration projects, it is crucial to consider the previous land uses and covers and landscape configuration as they have a significant impact on the entire process, especially seed dispersal and natural regeneration of sites. Thus, the objective of this work was to verify the effect of landscape (i.e., land use) on restoration success of total planting, seed sowing and natural regeneration sites in the Atlantic Forest biome, southeast Brazil. The methodology employed was based on demonstration units of restoration. The focus was on regenerant richness and abundance indicators, along with land use and land cover data (class area) from 2010, 2015, and 2020, obtained from the MapBiomas Project. Generalized linear models and correlation analysis were used for the study. We hypothesize that a landscape with more forest and natural regeneration cover (mosaic of agriculture and pasture) would positively affect regenerants in restored sites, which we only observed for natural regeneration treatment sites. In active restoration treatment sites, mosaic of agriculture and pasture was negatively and farming was positively associated to regenerants. We also found greater density and richness of regenerants in natural regeneration treatment sites than in seed sowing and seedling planting. The influence of the surrounding landscape, particularly mosaic, played a crucial role in this success. In addition, land use cover history, as we observed in classes in the last five and ten years, did explain regenerants in studied sites. Thus, results show that the characterization of landscape context and previous land-use history is essential to understand the limitations to succession and define cost-effective restoration strategies. © 2024, Sociedade de Investigacoes Florestais.

AB  - Successional agroforestry systems have the capacity to increase soil fertility and restore degraded ecosystems. The objective of this study was to investigate the influence of agroforestry systems, at different stages of ecological succession, on the dynamics of chemical and physical soil fertility attributes in the Brazil South region. Soil samples were collected under five different conditions: (i) Control (T) = initial system (without agroforestry); (ii) SAF1 = agroforestry with 1 year of development; (iii) SAF3 = agroforestry with 3 years of development; (iv) SAF7 = agroforestry with 7 years of development; and (v) reference system (naturally regenerating forest with 30 years). Subsequently, determinations/calculations were carried out for chemical attributes/parameters (exchangeable Ca2+, Mg2+, K+, Na+, P, Al3+, H+, sum of bases, effective and potential cation exchange capacity, cation exchange saturation with bases and Al3+), physical attributes (soil bulk density, particle density, total porosity, and moisture), and soil physicochemical properties (pH H2O, pH in saline solutions, and SMP method), as well as chemical element stocks were calculated based on soil mass in each sampled layer. Results showed an increase in pH, total porosity, and nutrient stocks with the systems' development time, accompanied by a decrease in acidity components. The increase in soil fertility is directly related to the increase in soil organic matter content. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2024.

AB  - Eucalyptus species are cultivated for various purposes around the world, mainly because they adapt well and grow quickly. These productive matrices of planted forests are common in Brazil, added to which, areas of native vegetation are requirements of environmental legislation. Although eucalyptus plantations are widely distributed in Brazil, little is known about the soil seed bank (SSB) in the eucalyptus productive matrix (EPM). We aim to understand how the EPM made up of eucalyptus plantations and native forest remnants affect the SSB in the Brazilian Pampa. Samples of the SSB of EPM were collected and monitored for 6 months in a shade house. We evaluated seedling emergence, richness, composition, ecological characteristics of the species, diversity, and floristic similarity. We recorded a high rate of seedling emergence, species richness, and different life forms and native species in all EPM treatments; however, the similarity between native remnants and eucalyptus plantations was low. The size and level of conservation of native remnants and the position and management of eucalyptus sites in the EPM influenced the diversity and composition of species. Eucalyptus plantations contain SSBs with potential for natural regeneration when they are in a landscape that maintains conserved native forest remnants. These results expand the knowledge of the SSB in EPM and can support actions in ecological restoration projects. © 2024 The Author(s).

AB  - Amazonian species are generally unable to adapt to long drought periods, indicating a low capacity to adjust their hydraulic traits. Secondary forests account for 20% of forest cover in the Amazon, making natural regeneration species crucial under climate change scenarios. In this study, we compared the hydraulic traits of five species, including non-pioneers (Bertholletia excelsa Bonpl., Carapa guianensis Aubl., Hymenaea courbaril L.) and pioneers [Cedrela fissilis Vell., Tabebuia rosea (Bertol.) Bertero ex A.DC.], across light conditions (understory, intermediate, gap) in a 22-year-old secondary forest in Central Amazon, Brazil. Twenty-five saplings were planted and monitored in 3 plots × 5 blocks. Five years after the plantation, we assessed growth, wood density, leaf water potential at predawn and midday, xylem embolism resistance (P50), and hydraulic safety margins (HSM). The leaf water potential ranged from -2.9 to 0 MPa. The non-pioneer species C. guianensis and H. courbaril exhibited the lowest P50 (-4.06 MPa), indicating higher embolism resistance, whereas the pioneer T. rosea had the highest P50 (-1.25 MPa), indicating lower resistance. The HSM varied from -1.60 to 3.26 MPa, with lower values in gap conditions during the dry period (-1.60 MPa), especially affecting pioneer species. Wood density was influenced by both light and species type, with non-pioneers showing a generally higher density, with H. courbaril reaching 0.75 g cm-3 in the understory while the pioneer T. rosea showed the lowest density (0.27 g cm-3). These results highlight that light conditions affect hydraulic traits differently across species strategies, especially during early growth. Non-pioneer, slow-growing native species appear more resilient to light variation, making them suitable for future plantations aimed at climate adaptation in secondary forests. © 2024 The Author(s).

AB  - The Critically Endangered Alagoas Antwren Myrmotherula snowi is found only in the Atlantic Rainforest of north-east Brazil. We surveyed all sites where the species has been recorded, as well as 15 other potential sites. We summarise all observations of the species, focusing on the period from 2016 onwards, and including systematic censuses in three breeding seasons (October-March 2018/19, 2019/20, and 2020/21) at the type locality, Murici, where we also searched for nests of the species. We did not locate any individuals at sites other than Murici. The number of apparent individuals detected declined by 67% over seven years (a decline of 50% over the three years in which standardised systematic counts were made), and only six adults were observed in the most recent breeding season. The global population is now likely to be in single-digit figures. Of five nests found, four failed, through predation by snakes and opossums, and abandonment. We installed protective barriers to protect two of these nests from predators, which may have contributed to the single successful fledging. Such methods offer most hope for now of stalling the decline. Efforts to develop captive breeding methods with model species have been underway since 2019 but face many difficulties. Improving habitat protection and restoration is crucial but will only take effect in the long term.  © The Author(s), 2024.

AB  - Following old-growth forest loss and subsequent land abandonment, secondary forest grows throughout the Amazon biome. For Amazonas, agricultural colonization was unsuccessful in many regions, leading to the regeneration of secondary forest and carbon storage under favorable climate conditions. Herein, the extent of regeneration in Amazonas and its timescale are investigated, including a granular analysis of its 62 municipalities, based on the MapBiomas dataset from 1985 to 2021. By 2021, 10,495 km2 of secondary forest had grown, corresponding to 28% of the lost old-growth forest. After normalization for algorithmic differences, this estimate was 17%–38% lower than prior studies for Amazonas that used earlier versions of the MapBiomas dataset, indicating increased accuracy in landcover assignments for more current versions of the dataset. For the northeastern microregion, representing the 15 municipalities of economic and population dominance in Amazonas, the growth of secondary forest varied from 3.0% to 9.8% of the total land area. For the southern microregion, constituting seven municipalities adjacent to large-scale deforestation of Mato Grosso and Rondônia, regeneration of secondary forest constituted 0.4%–1.2% of the land area. For the remaining interior municipalities, the regeneration was 0.0%–1.9%. Among the municipalities, the median regeneration interval, corresponding to the duration between the loss of old-growth forest and the appearance of secondary forest, ranged from 2 to 7 years. The median regeneration intervals of the interior, northeastern, and southern microregions were 3, 4, and 5 years, respectively. Even as the secular trend of deforestation continues in the Amazon biome and encroaches into the southern border of Amazonas state, the results herein indicate a possible resiliency toward secondary forest for undisturbed land on a timescale of several years, at least for mixed pasture-forest landscapes of kilometer-scale heterogeneity and assuming that a favorable climate persists for regeneration even as global change occurs. © 2024 The Author(s).

AB  - To mitigate the impacts of deforestation, Brazilian legislation requires the implementation of a Degraded Area Recovery Plan (PRAD). One way to assess the recovery of these areas is using bioindicators. This research tested the use of the drosophilid community structure as an indicator to evaluate post-mining area restoration. We compared two regeneration techniques within the same chronological sequence and as reference used the forest remnants within the exploration area. The study was conducted in the municipality of Paragominas—Pará, in areas managed by Hydro mining company. Five sites of forest remnants were selected, five in natural regeneration and five in the nucleation technique, the latter two making up the PRADs. A total of 5,919 male drosophilids were collected belonging to 10 genera, and 32 species. Rarefaction showed the curves of the PRADs to be more asymptotic, than forested areas. Forest areas are potentially richer and, on average, have lower abundances and lower diversity. Beta diversity components in the forest present greater turnover and less nestedness processes when compared to PRADs areas. The PRADs showed no differences between them for any of the analyzed patterns. D. nasuta and D. sturtevanti behaved as generalists in relation to habitats, D. paulistorum and D. willistoni as forest specialists. D. malerkotliana, D. simulans, Scaptodrosophila latifasciaeformis, and Zaprionus indianus behaved as specialists in PRADs areas. The structure of the drosophilid community varied according to the environment, proving to be a good indicator for forest and regenerating environments, but it did not detect differences between the PRADs environments in early regeneration (6 years). © 2023 Society for Ecological Restoration.

AB  - The Semiarid region in the Northeast of Brazil is characterized by Caatinga tropical forests, adapted to 8-to-9 months of annual water stress. Human activities have resulted in environmental degradation due to tree removal and soil exposure to erosion factors; however, planting native trees, such as Mimosa tenuiflora and Cnidoscolus quercifolius, may accelerate environmental recovery. Tree recovery was evaluated in a degraded areas under a 14-year period of grazing exclusion (2005 to 2019) and planting of M. tenuiflora (2005 and 2009) and C. quercifolius (2007 and 2009) and under natural regeneration. Data on survival, height, and diameter of planted seedlings, and the number, species, height, and diameter of naturally regenerating trees were collected. The absence of grazing allowed for the establishment of 50.5% and 44.6% of the 204 M. tenuiflora and 204 C. quercifolius planted seedlings, which presented mean heights of 395 and 355 cm and mean basal diameters of 92 and 76 mm. Naturally regenerated M. tenuiflora and C. quercifolius totaled 190 and 7 plants, with heights of 95 and 139 cm, and basal diameters of 10 and 26 mm. A naturally established specimen of Cenostigma pyramidale with a height of 175 cm and basal diameter of 36 mm was found. This denotes the positive effect of seedling planting on tree cove compared to a nearby continuously grazed area; however, full recovery, especially regarding diversity of the tree community, requires more than 14-year grazing exclusion, tree planting, and natural regeneration. © 2024, Universidade Federal Rural do Semi-Arido.

AB  - Direct seeding has been considered a cost-effective system for ecological restoration with tree species, compared to planting nursery-raised seedlings. Over the last years, several field experiments have been conducted in worldwide to enhance the success of the technique and to test its feasibility at different sites, sowing conditions, and species composition. Based on the analysis of data sets from 53 field experiments conducted in Brazil, we (1) assessed the technical and ecological feasibility of direct seeding systems for ecological restoration using tree species, (2) synthesized the main advances and challenges already reported, and (3) provided future guidelines for restoration scientists and practitioners. Our study indicates that direct seeding is mostly conducted in the two Brazilian hotspots (Atlantic Forest and Cerrado), on abandoned pastures, and using a high number of seeds per hectare. Establishment and growth rates are very low for most sites, but survival rates are usually high. To achieve satisfactory tree seedling density and ground coverage, and to eliminate exotic species that constrain natural regeneration and succession, it is necessary to use a high number of viable seeds. Currently, seed stocks are not promptly available to support direct seeding techniques applicability on larger scales. Although direct seeding can be considered a cost-effective system for forest restoration, this technique still needs to be improved before its recommendation on large scale, especially to enhance seedling emergence, establishment, and early growth of tree species, and reduce associated risks. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Pastures occupy approximately 20% of the Brazilian territory and a significant part of these areas are degraded and have legal environmental liabilities. Ecological restoration is necessary to remedy this liability. The objective of the present study was to determine the effectiveness of a forest restoration planting in an area previously used as buffalo pasture, through floristic and phytosociological parameters of natural regeneration. The study area was densely populated by invasive exotic grasses (Urochloa spp.) until 2006, when, after eliminating the grasses, six native tree species were planted at 2.5 × 1.6 m spacing. A total of 73 terrestrial plant species were found, the most important being Alchornea glandulosa Poepp. & Endl. - heliophilous, which showed high abundance in all strata. The restoration methodology employed was effective in triggering natural succession in the study area, resulting, after 12 years, in floristic and structural parameters consistent with the initial stage of development of the alluvial Dense Ombrophylous Forest. It is inferred that the well-preserved landscape in the region has been determinant in providing the propagules and dispersers that made the observed species richness possible, while the planting tends to have contributed with the control of grasses and with the recovery of the forest environment, facilitating the arrival and development of these propagules. Evidence of soil degradation by use as pasture was observed, and in former buffalo bathing areas neither restoration planting nor natural regeneration developed. © 2023, Floresta.

AB  - Urban forest fragments are subjected to anthropogenic pressures that can impact their regeneration process. We analyzed plant floristic and functional composition of regeneration mechanisms of urban forest fragment with 2 ha at the Guarulhos International Airport, São Paulo State, Brazil, to evaluate their functional resilience to anthropogenic disturbance. The tree vegetation showed high richness with a predominance of zoochoric and shade-tolerant species. The regeneration mechanisms are composed predominantly by the native tree species, but they presented anthropogenic impacts and are susceptible to biological invasion. The greater abundance of fast-growing species along in the regeneration mechanisms shows that the process of forest secondarization has been established, which could lead the forest fragments towards an early-successional stages, altering their floristic and functional composition. © 2024, SciELO-Scientific Electronic Library Online.

AB  - The partial or complete loss of vegetation cover triggers an increase in surface runoff, erosion, and sedimentation of water bodies, including reservoirs for hydroelectric power generation, reducing their life expectancy. To control or mitigate this issue, ecological restoration interventions should prioritize the recovery of areas most vulnerable to these processes, such as springs. Conversely, wildfires cause damage to vegetation cover and hinder ecological restoration and/or natural regeneration processes. Therefore, this study aimed to identify-with the aid of Geographic Information Systems-the temporal and spatial likelihood of fire occurrences in spring recharge areas undergoing ecological restoration and contributing to hydroelectric reservoirs in southern Minas Gerais, Brazil. The findings indicated that the months with the highest probability of wildfire occurrences were August and September (accounting for 66% of cases), requiring increased attention to prevention efforts. Furthermore, locations most susceptible to fires (steeper slopes, more flammable vegetation, and higher anthropogenic use) should be treated as priorities for both prevention and ecological restoration actions. © 2024, Sociedade de Investigacoes Florestais.

AB  - In the savanna-seasonally dry tropical forest ecotone in Northeastern Brazil, we studied variations in flora and structure within old growth and two sites in secondary succession (10 and 25 years). We sampled 2,127 trees and shrubs with a diameter at ground level of 3 cm or more, excluding cacti, palm trees, and vines. Old growth contained 478 plants from 29 species, the 25-year site had 819 plants from 27 species, and the 10-year site had 829 plants from 25 species, totaling 38 species across the sites. Regarding the regenerating stratum, we found 2,776 individuals, with the largest and smallest number of individuals for 10 and 25 years regeneration, respectively. Rarefaction and Jacknife richness showed greater tree richness in old growth, whereas 10 and 25 years regeneration presented similar richness estimates; furthermore, the highest richness in the regenerating stratum was observed in 10 years and the lowest in old growth. Our results reveal that changes in composition are caused by species replacement, demonstrating that even in areas deforested for traditional agriculture, turnover causes significant changes in composition and results in the requirement of a long time for reestablishment, similar to the old growth. © 2024 Instituto de Pesquisas Jardim Botanico do Rio de Janeiro.

AB  - Anthropogenic forest fires are occurring with increasing frequency in tropical forests, with negative consequences for a variety of ecological processes, including litterfall. Litterfall provides several ecosystem services, such as nutrient cycling and carbon storage, thus playing an important role in ecosystem functioning. We assessed the impacts of fire and fire-created edges on litterfall in Atlantic Forest remnants in Bahia, Brazil. Litterfall was assessed at monthly intervals over one year along seven 300 m-long transects placed perpendicular to the edge between the unburnt forest and the burnt forest. We installed litterfall traps at the edge (0 m) and 20, 40, 60, 80, 100 and 150 m into both the burnt and unburnt forest. The total litterfall was smaller in the burnt forest (mean of 2.5 ± 2.2 SD t.ha−1.y−1) than in the unburnt forest (mean of 5.9 ± 3.4 SD t.ha−1.y−1). In addition, leaf litter gradually increased from the edge toward the unburnt forest interior. Our results highlight that there is less litterfall in the burnt forest, and that the relative contribution of different litter types (leaves, twigs, and miscellaneous litter) differ between burnt forest and unburnt forest. The lower amount of litterfall in the burnt forest and forest edge may have negative consequences for the natural regeneration of these areas, as the ecosystem services provided by plant litter that are important for forest regeneration are likely to be impaired. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2024.

AB  - This study was carried out at the Vale Natural Reserve in Linhares, Espírito Santo, Brazil, with the objective of testing the use of direct seeding as a forest restoration method in Tabuleiro Forest (also called Tableland Forest outside of Brazil) 16 years after its implantation. Three different treatments were evaluated in which 29 native species with different area preparations were used, namely: Total manual mowing + residue burning + herbicide (T1); Total manual mowing + residue burning (T2); and Total manual mowing (T3). Each treatment had an area of 100m² (10x10m) and an interval between plots of 2 m. The survival of the individuals implanted in the direct seeding was evaluated, as well as the natural regeneration of the new individuals with Diameter at Breast Height (DBH) = 15 cm. As a result, after 16 years we can see the presence of 16 species and 106 individuals, as well as a Shannon’s diversity index of (H’) = 1.917 and Pielou’s index (P) = 0.691, demonstrating a low floristic diversity in the area. The species which stood out the most (most individuals) were: Joannesia princeps Vell. L.C.; Spondias venulosa (Engl.) Engl.; and Peltophorum dubium (Spreng.) Taub. As a suggestion, it is recommended to use direct seeding in a complementary manner to other restoration techniques, and there should be monitoring of the area in order to assess the evolution of the process and the need for any interventions to assertively assist the entire process © 2023, Floresta.

AB  - Forest landscape restoration is a global priority to mitigate negative effects of climate change, conserve biodiversity, and ensure future sustainability of forests, with international pledges concentrated in tropical forest regions. To hold restoration efforts accountable and monitor their outcomes, traditional strategies for monitoring tree cover increase by field surveys are falling short, because they are labor-intensive and costly. Meanwhile remote sensing approaches have not been able to distinguish different forest types that result from utilizing different restoration approaches (conservation versus production focus). Unoccupied Aerial Vehicles (UAV) with light detection and ranging (LiDAR) sensors can observe forests` vertical and horizontal structural variation, which has the potential to distinguish forest types. In this study, we explored this potential of UAV-borne LiDAR to distinguish forest types in landscapes under restoration in southeastern Brazil by using a supervised classification method. The study area encompassed 150 forest plots with six forest types divided in two forest groups: conservation (remnant forests, natural regrowth, and active restoration plantings) and production (monoculture, mixed, and abandoned plantations) forests. UAV-borne LiDAR data was used to extract several Canopy Height Model (CHM), voxel, and point cloud statistic based metrics at a high resolution for analysis. Using a random forest classification model we could successfully classify conservation and production forests (90% accuracy). Classification of the entire set of six types was less accurate (62%) and the confusion matrix showed a divide between conservation and production types. Understory Leaf Area Index (LAI) and the variation in vegetation density in the upper half of the canopy were the most important classification metrics. In particular, LAI understory showed the most variation, and may help advance ecological understanding in restoration. The difference in classification success underlines the difficulty of distinguishing individual forest types that are very similar in management, regeneration dynamics, and structure. In a restoration context, we showed the ability of UAV-borne LiDAR to identify complex forest structures at a plot scale and identify groups and types widely distributed across different restored landscapes with medium to high accuracy. Future research may explore a fusion of UAV-borne LiDAR with optical sensors, and include successional stages in the analyses to further characterize and distinguish forest types and their contributions to landscape restoration. © 2023 The Authors

AB  - Our aim was to evaluate whether the richness and composition of anurans responded to the time of forest regeneration via secondary succession. We sampled the anuran community in a mosaic of areas at three different stages of secondary succession in the Atlantic Forest, southern Brazil. The anurans were collected from nine lentic ponds and from their margins up to a 50 m radius. The late secondary forest sheltered the higher species richness, followed by the primary forest. The spatial variation in species richness was related to the forest succession stage and predominance of arboreal vegetation on the pond edge. The species composition changed throughout the succession stages, regardless of the distance among areas. Along the gradient of forest succession, environmental changes have driven species distribution, limiting the occurrence of forest species and favoring the colonization of areas at the early succession stage by opportunist species. We could observe that the secondary forest succession was a determining factor in the anuran community structure, and with the advancement of the secondary succession, both richness and composition were partly restored. Thus, the conservation of secondary forests might be an efficient strategy to preserve the biodiversity in areas of the Atlantic Forest. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - The availability and retention of phosphorus (P) in soils under recovery process after mining operations play an important role in the management of this nutrient. The objective of this study was to evaluate the P adsorption in a reconstituted soil as a function of two forest recovery processes after bauxite mining. We evaluated three systems: native forest (FOR), planting of forest seedlings after bauxite mining (TPL), and natural regeneration of vegetation after bauxite mining (NRV). In each system, eight sampling plots were deployed. In each plot, we collected litter and soil samples. The soil samples were collected at depths of 0–5, 5–10, 10–20, and 20–40 cm, for soil chemical analysis and adjustment of P adsorption isotherms. We also performed an inventory of the tree vegetation to obtain basal area (G) and species diversity (H′). Forest was significantly superior with respect to most soil fertility, litter, and vegetation attributes, followed by natural regeneration and planting. In general, the adsorption curves and maximum phosphorus adsorption capacity (MPAC) in soil followed the order planting > natural regeneration > forest. We observed a negative relationship between phosphorus adsorption and soil organic matter, potential acidity, and available phosphorus. This result highlights the importance of biomass conservation and maintenance to ensure phosphorus availability in reclamation practices. Furthermore, such results indicate that both soil cover and plant species diversity should be considered when selecting species to improve P availability for reclamation of mined areas. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Urgent action is needed in the Amazon to halt deforestation, repair agricultural damage, and restore forests to revive ecosystemic functions such as carbon (C) storage and soil health. A critical and demanding challenge, especially in sandy soils, is ceasing the slash-and-burn in smallholder farming livelihoods to preserve ecosystem services of primary and secondary forests. Here, we examined (i) the recovery of secondary forests in structure, litter layer, and soil health, as well as C storage post-agricultural abandonment of extremely sandy Amazonian soils (> 89 % sand), and (ii) the extent of loss of these gains when a secondary forest is burned for agricultural reconversion. We tracked secondary forests at 2, 5, 10, and 20 years, including slash-and-burning the 20-year-old forest. Our methods included analyzing C stocks in soil, litter, and plants, forest vegetation ecological indexes, litter quality assessed through nitrogen (N), C, and lignocellulose contents, δ13C to indicate organic matter origin, and seven additional soil health indicators. Soil δ13C ranged from −27.1 to −28.8 ‰ across the sites, indicating a negligible influence of tropical grasses on the soil's organic matter and suggesting that pastures were not previously cultivated in these areas. Secondary forest growth accumulated 0.24 and 2.97 Mg C ha−1 y−1 in litter and trees, respectively. Yet, soil C stocks did not show significant changes during 20 years of forest regeneration. Over 18 years, the forest increased the vegetation diversity fourfold and litter N by 41 %, improving forest structure and litter quality. This progress in organic matter aboveground contributed to improved soil biological activity and nutrient storage, facilitating soil health and multifunctionality regeneration as the forest aged. However, slash-and-burn resulted in a 67.6 Mg C ha−1 loss, reverting levels below those of the 2-year-old forest. Returning to agriculture also depleted soil cation exchange capacity, bulk density, and fauna activity, degrading soil's chemical, physical, and biological functions to levels comparable to or worse than those in the youngest forest. We conclude that Amazonian lands abandoned after long-term agriculture still offer potential for ecological restoration, with secondary forests capable of regenerating multiple ecosystem functions, even in sandy soils. However, a single slash-and-burn reverses 20 years of progress and degrades soil health further. Recognizing smallholder farmers' poverty and reliance on slash-and-burn, we advocate for educational and socioeconomic support to stop fires and encourage sustainable agriculture, including bioeconomy incentives and environmental compensation to sustain the perpetuation and benefits of secondary forests in the Amazon. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The palm Syagrus coronata is a key non-timber forest products (NTFP) resource for the livelihood and income of people and is the main food item of the threatened endemic Lear's Macaw (Anadorhynchus leari) in semi-arid Brazil. To contribute to the planning conservation and management of this resource, we assessed how environmental and anthropogenic factors affect the natural regeneration and population structure of S. coronata and identified the relative importance of these factors in the abundance of life stages. We found that (1) recruitment failure occurs mostly in populations in agricultural and intensive grazing areas; (2) regeneration density was positively associated with the density of reproductive plants; and (3) current leaf or fruit harvesting levels were not detected to affect population density and recruitment. Populations subject to chronic anthropogenic disturbance, which lead to poor natural regeneration and recruitment bottlenecks, are likely to become locally extinct. Although populations of S. coronata are locally threatened, the persistence of the species in the landscape is currently ensured by its management and protection in different land uses by local populations that have this species as an important source of food and financial resources. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Background: Local ecological knowledge (LEK) has been a great ally in developing conservation strategies that are more attuned to the local reality. However, since this knowledge is dynamic, it is necessary to conduct studies that understand how cultural, sociodemographic and ecological factors can affect it. In this regard, the present study to assess the knowledge of farmers from different communities regarding plant species in forests of varying ages, as well as the sociodemographic and environmental perception factors that may influence them. Methods: The study was conducted in two rural communities in the municipality of José de Freitas, Piauí, Brazil. The research involved farmers who possess knowledge about forests of different ages, selected through the snowball sampling technique. Data were collected through semi-structured interviews and guided tours for species collection. A total of 36 farmers participated in the study, including nine women and 27 men. Results:: Our study unveiled distinct plant species knowledge in rural communities for forests of varying ages, often tied to cultural contexts. Sociodemographic and environmental factors analysis revealed age and perceived forest regeneration time influenced early-stage plant knowledge. For late-stage plant knowledge, factors included fragment visits, perception of regeneration time, and their interaction. While communities had differing knowledge on early and late-stage plants, common explanatory factors emerged. Conclusions: The study suggests that in the studied communities, it's important to consider both age and current environmental experiences of farmers in LEK studies. This highlights the valuable contributions of both older and younger farmers in understanding changes in forest fragments of varying ages. © 2023, Ilia State University, Institute of Botany, Department of Ethnobotany.

AB  - Background The “Serra da Concórdia” is part of the Atlantic Forest phytogeographical domain in the Brazilian state of Rio de Janeiro and it has a predominant phytophysiognomy of Semideciduous Seasonal Forest. This region underwent intense habitat loss and fragmentation during the 19th century, due to coffee plantations and later pastures. With the decline of these activities, the areas were abandoned, triggering secondary succession. In 2002, the “Parque Estadual da Serra da Concórdia" was established in this region to preserve the remaining forest fragments. The updated list of vascular plants recorded in this protected area, published in the “Catálogo de Plantas das Unidades de Conservação do Brasil”, is presented here, along with information on richness, endemism, and conservation status. New information The “Parque Estadual da Serra da Concórdia" houses 231 vascular plant species, of which 90% are angiosperms, 10% ferns and lycophytes, and 27% endemic to the Atlantic Forest. Ten species are threatened with extinction, three are categorized as Endangered, and seven as Vulnerable. Although there have been expeditions in the “Parque Estadual da Serra da Concórdia”, they have been limited, resulting in a low number of records and the species richness for a protected area. This is notable considering the 2, 130 Brazilian native vascular plant species recorded in the semideciduous seasonal forest of Rio de Janeiro. Our data indicates that floristic inventories of Brazilian protected areas could help highlight gaps in flora knowledge and support the proposal of effective conservation actions. © (2024), (Pensoft Publishers).

AB  - The analysis of the interpretation of the integrity of the bond of the cement layer between the casing andthe formation in oil wells has grown significantly as plugging and Abandonment operations also grow.Interpreting this analysis is important to ensure that the well is hydraulically isolated from the surroundingenvironment before permanently sealing the well. However, this interpretation depends on a specialist'sability to analyze a large demand of data, which is complex and acquired through logging operations. Thisfact makes this process prone to errors, human dependence, and time-consuming. These three challengesmotivated Ouronova, in partnership with Repsol Sinopec Brazil, to develop software to help interpretacoustic profiling. Also inspired by the objective of optimizing the Plugging and Abandonment operationscompletely, the software also optimizes the planning and management of Plugging and Abandonmentcampaigns. The so-called plug and abandonment (P&A) Assistant software has proven to be a good tool thatoptimizes the Plugging and Abandonment process, using machine learning (ML) techniques to improve theaccuracy and reliability and reduce the time for cement sheath integrity analysis. This paper then presentssome supervised method techniques implemented in the software, such as Logistic Regression, k-NearestNeighbors, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Gaussian Naive Bayes. The results show that combiningfeatures derived from Cement Bond Log and Acoustic Impedance Log enables the construction of efficientmodels. The Gaussian model was the one with the best overall performance, achieving a Balanced PreciseAccuracy equal to 0.50 and a Balanced Adjacency Accuracy around 0.88.

AB  - Temporal monitoring of ecological restoration projects in the Pampa biome is still inadequate, with a gap in the knowledge of the successional trajectory of riparian forests under active restoration. Thus, monitoring of these areas based on a set of ecological indicators is crucial to assess the effectiveness of the restoration, as well as to ascertain the current state of the restoration project and the need for adaptive management actions. In this study, the progression of the techniques of planting in nuclei and passive restoration was investigated using ecological indicators. The study was carried out in the Serra do Sudeste, in an area of riparian forest. The region belongs to the Pampa biome, southern Brazil. The evaluations took place in two different monitoring periods, the first in 2018 and the second in 2021, in two areas, one under restoration by applied nucleation and the other under passive restoration. Ecological indicators of composition, structure, and function were measured, sampled in 10 plots through monitoring per area. The results showed significant differences between the monitoring periods in each area by the Kruskal-Wallis test (p < 0.05). The areas presented differences in floristic composition between monitoring periods by non-metric scaling analysis (nMDS), and differences in species contribution by similarity percentage analysis (SIMPER). The dendrometric variables (height, diameter, breast height, nuclei area, and crown area) presented a significant difference by the Kruskal-Wallis test (p < 0.05) in the evaluation of the development of the nuclei. The ecological indicators of structure (canopy cover, soil cover by litter and trees) and functionality (biotic dispersal syndrome) were statistically higher in the second monitoring period in the area under restoration by applied nucleation. In the area under passive restoration, the indicators of structure (litter thickness and soil cover by litter and trees) and functionality (biotic dispersal syndrome) were also statistically higher in the second monitoring period. In both areas, Baccharis dracunculifolia DC. was the species that most contributed to the floristic dissimilarity between the monitoring moments. In the development of the nuclei, the dendrometric variables were statistically superior in the second monitoring period, pointing to progression in the development of the nuclei. It is concluded that the restoration technique by applied nucleation is effective in the studied area, as the nuclei progress over time. The area under passive restoration showed signs of changes in ecological succession. The study result provide support for the improvement in future restoration projects for riparian areas in the Pampa biome. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Broad-scale parameters are crucial for the restoration of forest to align with the United Nations resolutions for the “Decade on Ecosystem Restoration.” Direct seeding is a moderately priced, active method with potential use in forest recovery. This study evaluated the recovery of woody vegetation from 23 restored forests (RF) located on the southern edge of the Brazilian Amazon, a region known as the “Arc of Deforestation”. We ask: (1) What are the differences in abundance, species richness, and alpha diversity between seeded and regenerated species in RF? (2) How does the structure, floristic composition, species richness, and alpha diversity of RF compare with adjacent primary forests (PF)? After 12 years of intervention, our results reveal that RFs exhibited lower species richness, alpha diversity, aboveground biomass (AGB), basal area, and dissimilar floristic composition when compared to PFs. Recovery in PFs reached 40% for AGB, 55% for basal area, 24% for alpha diversity, and 60% for species richness. These findings indicate ongoing recovery of evaluated parameters, highlighting the success of the seeding method in restoring degraded riparian forests. We also observed similar species richness between seeded and regenerated species in RFs, yet absolute density, AGB, and alpha diversity were higher in seeded species. The notable presence of non-seeded species in our plots provides evidence that direct seeding fosters spontaneous regeneration from the regional species pool. Our findings suggest that direct seeding is a viable option for restoring forest structure and diversity in areas with limited or no potential for passive regeneration. © 2023 Society for Ecological Restoration.

AB  - The conversion of caatinga vegetation areas into pastures in the Brazilian semiarid region has depleted soil fertility due to degradation. The natural regeneration of the caatinga has been the alternative adopted to restore soil fertility. However, the real effectiveness of this practice in recovering organic carbon (SOC) and nutrient stocks is unknown. This work evaluated the effect of natural regeneration of the caatinga vegetation on the restoration of levels and stocks of SOC, N, and P as a strategy to maintain the sustainability of the environment. We collected soil samples every 5 cm, up to 20 cm deep, in areas of degraded pasture, caatinga in regeneration (10 years), and regenerated caatinga (35 years) to evaluate the levels and stocks of SOC, N, and P. The depth significantly affects the levels and stocks of SOC, N, and P. Stocks and levels of SOC, N, and P were higher in regenerated caatinga > regenerating caatinga > degraded pasture. The regenerated caatinga increased SOC, N, and P stocks by 115%, 110%, and 117%, respectively, compared to the degraded pasture. Although 35 years of regeneration of the caatinga has improved soil fertility, the levels and stocks of SOC, N, and P remain low. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - Carbon (C) sequestration following land restoration is an efficient measure of climate change mitigation. However, most studies including the international “4 per 1000″ Initiative focus on topsoil C only. Here, we studied the response of deep soil C to different land restoration approaches. Samples were taken from rural sites in the Atlantic Forest Biome (Brazil), using a paired site design with triplicates of different 16-to-19-year-old restoration approaches of former arable land: reforestation, natural regeneration, and agroforestry sites. Adjacent arable land and a > 25-year-old secondary forest served as references. We determined aboveground and belowground C pools, including deep soil until 3 m depth. We did not find statistical differences among the three restoration methods for the C sequestration in the whole ecosystem. However, the C stock in the aboveground living biomass in the reforestation site was 85 ± 15 Mg ha−1, significantly exceeding the respective aboveground C in natural regeneration (40 ± 13 Mg ha−1) and agroforestry system (25 ± 5 Mg ha−1), respectively. This order, however, was reversed in soil, where reforestation caused a loss of soil organic carbon (SOC) by 27 Mg ha−1 below 40 cm depth, whereas SOC stocks in the agroforestry system and natural regeneration site increased by 41 and 25 Mg C/ha, respectively, compared to arable land. We thus conclude that deep soil carbon losses can negate aboveground carbon accrual after land restoration, which emphasizes the importance of including this pool in C sequestration studies. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Management of degraded tropical forest fragments is usually done by cutting climbers (cutting). However, it is still necessary to understand the outcomes of cutting in combination with planting native tree species' seedlings (cutting + planting), especially on the edges of fragments, which are subject to higher disturbance than the forest interior. We tested whether cutting + planting is the restoration strategy that most improves structural attributes of a degraded edge of a tropical seasonal semideciduous forest fragment in southeastern Brazil, relative to cutting and the absence of management (control). Linear mixed models revealed that, after an eight-year period, cutting + planting resulted in the highest decrease in the density and basal area of climbers longer than 1 m, and in the highest increase in the density of large living trees (diameter at breast height, DBH, ≥ 4.8 cm). Although cutting + planting decreased the percentage of large dead trees and increased tree sapling (DBH < 4.8 cm and total height ≥ 50 cm) richness, these variables were more affected by cutting. Management had no effect on the basal area of large living trees and tree sapling density. Because most structural attributes of the degraded edge studied were improved by cutting + planting, we advocate that it is the best strategy tested here for restoring tropical seasonal forests. We hypothesize that seedling planting improves forest conditions and stimulates recruitment, facilitating the regeneration of tree species. Thus, an interesting future avenue is to elucidate the mechanisms by which seedling planting affects regeneration and its long-lasting effects on forest structural attributes. © 2025 Association for Tropical Biology and Conservation.

AB  - Evaluating the diversity of multiple taxa is fundamental to understand community assembly and to assess the integrity and functionality of tropical secondary forests. In this study, we analyzed the natural regeneration of tropical dry forests (TDFs) in three regions of Brazil using Hill–Simpson diversity, abundance and β-diversity of trees and five groups of insects (herbivores, fruit-feeding butterflies, ants, culicid mosquitoes and dung beetles). Sampling was conducted in 39 0.1 ha plots using a chronosequence approach (13 plots in early, intermediate and old-growth forests). We evaluated the contribution of three different levels to γ-diversity: α (within plots), β1 (among plots) and β2 (among successional stages), and further determined the relative importance of turnover (species replacement) and nestedness (differences in species number among sites) to β2. Our results showed that, unexpectedly, the Hill–Simpson diversity was consistently higher in early than old-growth stages for all regions, but varied more widely in the intermediate stages. For each group separately, the same trend was observed for butterflies, ants, dung beetles and herbivores and did not differ among stages for mosquitoes. Successional differences in abundance were only detected for trees (increasing along the gradient) and for mosquitoes (decreasing). According to our expectations, the additive partitioning analysis showed that β2-diversity contributed more to γ-diversity than β1-diversity, when all taxa were considered together and for most of them separately (except for butterflies and dung beetles). Most of the β2-diversity was due to species turnover, but this contribution varied among groups and regions, with the highest turnover for herbivores and the lowest for dung beetles. Our results suggest that the Hill–Simpson diversity and changes in species composition (as given by β2-diversity) are better indicators of forest natural regeneration than raw species richness, corroborating previous studies with plants and animals. © 2024 Nordic Society Oikos.

AB  - Logging and agricultural exploitation have led to the degradation of Araucaria Forest remnants and the alteration of its last preserved patches. This forest typology contains many endangered plant species, as is the case of the tree Oreopanax fulvus Marchal. To support conservation of this species and understand how different landscape matrices can influence its populations, we evaluated the demographic structure and spatial distribution of O. fulvus in two Araucaria Forest remnants in Paraná state. We delimited two plots (urban and rural population), each with 1 ha, subdivided them into 100 subplots (10 x 10 m), and recorded diameter at ground level (DGL), height, and coordinates of two post-germinative developmental stage of individuals. In each subplot, we measured slope, luminosity, and canopy height. We used Ripley’s K function analysis to describe distribution patterns of the species and the spatial relationship between mature and juvenile trees. We performed correlations between abundance and environmental and structural variables of the O. fulvus populations. Abundance varied between remnants, from 183 individuals/ha (12 mature and 171 juvenile) to 1306 individuals/ha (10 and 1296). The remnants varied in abundance and plant frequency. The species showed an investment in seedling banks. Most juvenile had DGL up to 3.0 cm and height up to 1.0 m and presented aggregated spatial distribution, while adults had random distribution. In the rural population juvenile abundance were correlated with canopy height (positively) and distance to mature trees (negatively). The slope was correlated for both sites, but oppositely, indicating that other factors might have interfered in the regeneration abundance. The urban remnant showed a high abundance of this endangered species, calling attention for potential studies in urban arborization, management and conservation of these remnants. © 2023, Instituto Internacional de Ecologia.

AB  - Purpose: Lithic soils (with lithic contact up to 50 cm deep) are common in global drylands. Historically, have been little studied over time and the natural and anthropogenic factors that affect the storage of carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) in this soil group are little known. Methods: We used 118 lithic soil profiles to understand how climate (semi-arid and dry sub-humid), lithology, relief, and land-use (agriculture, pasture, secondary forest, and native forest) affect soil C and N stocks in drylands, northeastern Brazil. Results: Climate did not affect C and N stocks in lithic soils. However, soils with sedimentary lithology showed, on average, 17.4 and 27.1% less C and 20.5 and 38.2% less N than soils under metamorphic and igneous lithology, respectively. Soils under wavy relief presented the highest C (30.5 ± 16.9 Mg ha−1) and N (2.7 ± 1.2 Mg ha−1) stocks, while those under flat relief presented the lowest values (19.6 ± 16.3 Mg C ha−1 and 2.1 ± 1.5 Mg N ha−1), because of more significant anthropic use in profiles under flat relief. In general, soils under pasture and agriculture showed, on average, 73.6% and 65.8% less C than soils under native forest and the natural recovery of C and N stocks in soils (areas under natural regeneration) was limited, because of lithic contact close to the surface. Conclusion: We concluded that lithology, relief, and land use were the main factors affecting the accumulation of C and N in lithic soils, northeastern Brazil. Our results may be useful for sustainable use of lithic soils in drylands according to their aptitude and support capacity. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2024.

AB  - Ecological restoration is a process that helps restore a degraded, damaged, or destroyed ecosystem. Applied nucleation is considered a strategy that facilitates the development of vegetation, attracts dispersers, and, over time, tends to expand, coalescing into continuous forests. However, simply implementing restorative techniques is not enough, it is also necessary to monitor the process. Monitoring requires good ecological indicators, which is a challenge for ecological restoration. The present study aims to evaluate, through ecological indicators, the effectiveness of the applied nucleation for restoration of riparian forest. The study was carried out in the Serra do Sudeste, Pampa region, southern Brazil. Ecological indicators were analyzed in two areas of restoration: passive and active restoration. In the area under active restoration, paired plots were evaluated: intra-nuclei (inside the nuclei) and inter-nuclei (outside the nuclei). To assess natural regeneration, all regenerant shrubby and arboreal individuals taller than 30 cm were counted and taxonomically identified. The species were classified according to the dispersal syndrome. Shannon diversity indices and Pielou evenness were calculated. The canopy cover of nuclei and trees planted crown cover were evaluated. Ecological indicators were compared using Tukey's test (p < 0.05). The results showed a significant difference between passive, intra-nuclei, and inter-nuclei restorations for the evaluated indicators, with higher averages for intra-nuclei, followed by inter-nuclei and passive restorations. It is concluded that the intra-nuclei plots showed an increase in richness, abundance, biotic dispersal syndrome, canopy cover, and soil cover by plant litter and arboreal species. The applied nucleation is an effective strategy for ecological restoration in the study region. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The Brazilian Cerrado is a hotspot of biodiversity conservation and an important global agricultural region. Cultivated pastures under different degradation levels are dominant in the landscape and are being targeted for sustainable agricultural intensification and restoration of native vegetation. In this study, we classified the cultivated pastures of the Brazilian Cerrado according to their potential for natural regeneration, based on field surveys and environmental predictors. We surveyed the native vegetation cover in 186 plots distributed along 93 cultivated pastures. The environmental predictors considered in this study were the proportion of sand in the soil, cation exchange capacity, climate water deficit, pasture age, slope, and pasture vigor index. We then applied the Random Forest regression algorithm to predict and map the cultivated pastures according to their potential for natural regeneration in the 19 Cerrado ecoregions. The potential for natural regeneration was classified into low (< 30% of native plant cover), medium (30–50%), and high (> 50%). Our prediction explained 75% of the data variability. Most of the cultivated pastures presented medium potential for natural regeneration (57%), while 31% and 12% presented high and low potentials, respectively. Cultivated pastures in ecoregions with high mechanization, due to their high water availability and extensive flat terrains, presented low potential for natural regeneration. This first attempt to map the potential for natural regeneration in the cultivated pastures of the Brazilian Cerrado can be used as a proxy for planning low-cost and predictable restoration or environmentally sustainable intensification in this major type of land use found in this biome. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Soil organic matter is closely linked to the quality of Agroecosystems and directly influences the agricultural production and the environmental conditions. Understanding of soil organic matter dynamics in agroforestry systems requires studies with a temporal focus, since the changes in its chemical composition tend to follow a gradual behavior. The aim of this study was to investigate the dynamics of changes in stocks and chemical composition of soil organic matter under agroforestry, using systems in different stages of vegetation succession. The soil sampling was carried out from trenches, and litter fractions were also sampled. The samples were collected from different layers of the soil profile under the following conditions: Control; agroforestry with 1 year; agroforestry with 3 years; agroforestry with 7 years and Forest in natural regeneration. The following attributes/parameters were determined/calculated: i) C and N contents and stocks and C/N ratio; ii) C and N proportions in soil granulometric fractions and iii) kinetics of organic matter accumulation in soil with the time of systems evolution. The results showed: i) The C/N ratio tended to increase in depth but did not show a clear variation between the systems evaluated; ii) the adoption of successive agroforestry practices has the potential to increase the C and N stocks in soil; iii) the soil organic matter accumulation occurs gradually during the systems evolution and is mainly related to the particulate fraction (> 0.053 mm). © 2024, Academia Brasileira de Ciencias.

AB  - Forest regeneration is becoming a powerful tool to combat land conversion which covers 30 % of the Neotropical territory. However, little is known about the effect of forest regeneration on vector-borne diseases. Here, we describe the haemosporidian lineage composition across a successional gradient within an Atlantic Forest bird community. We test whether forest successional stages, in addition to host life history traits affect haemosporidian infection probability. We sampled birds at 16 sampling units with different successional stages between 2017 and 2018 within a forest remnant located in Antonina, Paraná, Brazil. We captured bird individuals using mist-nets, identified them to the species level, and collected blood samples to detect and identify Plasmodium and Haemoproteus lineages based on molecular analysis. We used a Bayesian phylogenetic linear model with a Bernoulli distribution to test whether the haemosporidian infection probability is affected by nest type, foraging stratum, and forest successional stage. We captured 322 bird individuals belonging to 52 species and 21 families. We found 31 parasite lineages and an overall haemosporidian prevalence of 23.9 %, with most infections being caused by Plasmodium (21.7 % of prevalence). The Plasmodium probability of infection was associated with forest successional stage and bird foraging stratum. Birds from the secondary forest in an intermediate stage of succession are more likely to be infected by the parasites than birds from the primary forests (β = 1.21, 95 % CI = 0.11 – 2.43), birds from upper strata exhibit a lower probability of infection than birds from lower foraging strata (β = -1.81, 95 % CI = -3.80 – -0.08). Nest type did not affect the Plasmodium probability of infection. Our results highlight the relevance of forest succession on haemosporidian infection dynamics, which is particularly relevant in a world where natural regeneration is the main tool used in forest restoration. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Seed rain is critical for forest recovery, especially in abandoned lands that have been converted to agriculture. However, such a critical role depends on seed viability, which has been largely overlooked in most seed rain studies. We assessed the viability of seeds in the seed rain falling into 12 plots from a Brazilian tropical dry forest: six plots exposed to slash-and-burn agriculture (‘burned plots’ = 111 seeds from 10 species) and six located in forest stands (‘control plots’ = 5267 seeds from 23 species). Using the tetrazolium test, we found that only 767 of 5378 seeds (14%) from 16 species were viable, but surprisingly, seed viability was 2.2 times higher in burned plots than in control ones. This does not imply that forest regeneration through seed rain is more effective in burned plots, as very few seeds arrived at these plots. A functional analysis revealed that the higher seed viability in burned plots may be explained by the fact that these plots were dominated by relatively large, hard-coated (orthodox), and abiotically dispersed seeds, with some type of dormancy, as seeds with these functional trait attributes showed the highest viability. To accurately assess the importance of seed rain for forest regeneration we must consider seed viability, as it can be very low in some places, especially if dominated by species with relatively small, animal-dispersed and recalcitrant seeds lacking dormancy. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Mining contributes importantly to tropical deforestation and land degradation. To mitigate these effects, mining companies are increasingly obliged to restore abandoned mine lands, but factors driving restoration success are hardly evaluated. Here, we investigate the influence of ecological factors (restoration age, soil properties and surrounding forest area) and management factors (diversity and density of planted species, mine zone) on the recovery rate of forest structure and tree diversity on 40 post-mining restoration areas in Southern Amazonia, Brazil, using a 9-year annual monitoring dataset consisting of over 25 000 trees. We found that recovery of forest structure was closely associated with interactions between soil quality and the planted tree communities, and that tree diversity recovery was positively associated with the amount of surrounding forests. We also observed that forest structure and diversity recover more slowly in mine tailings compared to pit surroundings. Our study confirms the complexity of mine land restoration but also reveals that planting design and soil improvement can increase restoration success. For resource-efficient mine restoration, we recommend the focusing of efforts on tailings, which are hardest to restore, and reducing efforts in pit surroundings and areas close to surrounding forest because of their potential for restoration by natural regeneration.

AB  - Recruitment models in rainforests are important for studies on forest management sustainability and can guide the assessment of remaining stocks and timber harvesting. Therefore, the objective of this study was to estimate recruitment after Reduced Impact Logging (RIL) by using two categories of models: a distance-independent individual-tree model (ITM) and a matrix model of forest dynamics or transition matrix (TMM). Data from continuous inventories conducted in a Dense Ombrophilous Forest in Paragominas, Pará state, Brazil, were utilized. Two transects of 9 ha each were installed at an area with Reduced Impact Logging, the data was collected in 2005 (nine months after logging), then in 2006, 2008, 2010 and 2012. Considering a period of 8 years after RIL, the individual tree-based model and transition matrix give consistent predictions of the recruitment in the study area. However, we observed slight superiority by the ITM, which presented values closer to the real ones for the total number of trees per hectare. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Open pit rubbish dumps generate serious environmental problems both in Brazil and elsewhere. The goal of this study was to evaluate the occurrence patterns of an assemblage of small flightless mammals in the area of a landfill deactivated 19 years ago. During nine campaigns, three different sites located in a subtropical protected area near the city of Matinhos, Paraná coast, southern Brazil, were sampled. The selected places were an artificial clearing where urban waste had previously been dumped (Area 1), a site with less anthropic influence with tree species and a poorly developed understorey (Area 2), and a site with well-formed vegetation, with herbaceous, shrubby and tree strata well developed (Area 3). The total capture effort was 5210 trap-nights; 109 captures were made of 82 individuals from five species of Rodentia (all from the subfamily Sigmodontinae) and three species of marsupials (Order Didelphimorphia). The most conserved site (Area 3) had higher abundance than areas 1 and 2 (binomial test; P<0.05). Area 1, considered the most affected, showed less species richness (n=6) than the other two areas (7 and 8 species), although this may be affected by the lower number of captures. The diversity in Area 1, estimated by the Shannon index, was lower than in areas 2 and 3 (Hutcheson’s t tests; H’=1.26 for Area 1 vs. 1.76 and 1.68 for Areas 2 and 3, respectively), although the composition of the assemblage did not differ significantly between the areas (PERMANOVA; P=0.085). Our results show that even after 19 years of inactivity, the deposited waste is still having a negative impact on the environment, and highlight the resilience of some native small mammal species in exploiting the resources of degraded areas. © 2023, Asociacion Argentina de Ecologia.

AB  - Callithrix kuhlii is present in forest mosaics, edge habitats, and abandoned fields in the Atlantic Forest. In Bahia and Minas Gerais. This study aimed to identify helminths from C. kuhlii and relate them to the clinical data, weights, and indices of the liver and gonads. Necropsies were performed on 13 adult marmosets that were run over on the BA-001 highway. A principal component analysis (PCA) was conducted to describe the relationships between the variables investigated. Fifty-one helminths were collected from 30.77% (4/13) of the marmosets analyzed. Helminths were classified based on their morphological and morphometric characteristics. Primasubulura jacchi (Marcel, 1857), Platynosomum illiciens (Dougherty, 1946), and Prosthenorchis confusus (Dougherty, 1946) were the species identified, with prevalence rates of 7.69%, 7.69%, and 15.38%, respectively. In addition, this is a new host record of P. confusus. The two main axes of the PCA explained a high variability (PCA=67.7%), indicating reduced weight and indices of the organs of parasitized animals. This study expands the knowledge on parasites of C. kuhlii and its vulnerability to parasites, contributing to constructing an epidemiological profile of environmental health. © 2024, Brazilain Coll Veterinary Parasitology.

AB  - Mining in the municipality of Capitão Poço, Pará, has resulted in soil degradation as the main consequence. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the stocks of the elements (N, P, K+, Na+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Fe, Zn, Cu, and Mn) in roots in areas of post-pebble mining recovery in Pará, Brazil. The study was carried out in four areas, namely the area under recovery with soil bioengineering techniques (complementary construction technique and soil stabilization technique), the area under recovery with a natural regeneration process, the degraded area, and the native forest located in the municipality of Capitão Poço-PA. Roots were collected at 0-10, 10-20, 20-30, 30-40, 40-50, 50-60, 60-80, and 80-100 cm soil layers, quantified the dry biomass and contents of macro and micronutrients, and then, estimated the stocks of elements in roots. The data of the element stocks in roots were subjected to the Shapiro-Wilk normality tests and analysis of variance. Means were compared using the Tukey test at 5% significance using the SISVAR statistical software. The highest average Na+, Ca2+, and Mg2+ values in fine roots were in areas with bioengineering and native forest. The native forest presented the highest average values of macro and micronutrients in fine and thick roots. Furthermore, the lowest stocks of elements in roots were in the degraded area. However, bioengineering techniques are effective in recovering degraded soils, as vegetation cover reestablishes the balance of the soil-plant system. © 2024, Universidade Federal Rural do Semi-Arido.

AB  - Despite recent advances in revealing the evolutionary history of speciose tropical plant clades, many species radiations are still poorly understood phylogenetically. One of these is the species-rich neotropical genus Tachigali (~ 90 spp.), a caesalpinioid legume lineage of mostly ant-housing canopy trees that has diversified in the tropical rainforest biome across the Andean foothills, Amazon basin, and Atlantic Coastal Forest of Brazil. It is also ecologically dominant across the fire-prone savanna vegetation of the Brazilian Cerrado. The taxonomic history of Tachigali has long been confounded with the genus Sclerolobium, with the two differing in floral symmetry. Here, we reconstruct the phylogeny of Tachigali using densely sampled Bayesian and maximum likelihood analyses of nuclear ribosomal (ITS/5.8S) and plastid (matK and trnL intron) DNA sequences for 67 species. All phylogenetic analyses support Tachigali as monophyletic. We recognize a broad circumscription of Tachigali encompassing species exhibiting both radially and bilaterally symmetrical flowers, and we suggest that the traditional generic concept of Sclerolobium should be abandoned. The poor resolution in the Tachigali phylogeny is suggestive of rapid diversification, which has been observed in other species-rich rainforest-inhabiting plant clades across the Neotropics. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Botanical Society of Sao Paulo 2024.

AB  - Tree monocultures constitute an increasing fraction of the global tree cover and are the dominant tree-growing strategy of forest landscape restoration commitments. Their advantages to produce timber are well known, but their value for biodiversity is highly controversial and context dependent. Therefore, understanding whether, and in which conditions, they can harbor native species regeneration is crucial. Here, we conducted meta-analyses based on a global survey of the literature and on a database created with local, unpublished studies throughout Brazil to evaluate the regeneration potential of native species under tree monocultures and the way management influences this regeneration. Native woody species regeneration under tree monocultures harbors a substantial fraction of the diversity (on average 40% and 68% in the global and Brazilian surveys, respectively) and abundance (on average 25% and 60% in the global and Brazilian surveys, respectively) of regeneration observed in natural forests. Plantations with longer rotation lengths, composed of native tree species, and located adjacent to forest remnants harbor more species. Pine plantations harbor more native individuals than eucalypt plantations, and the abundance of regenerating trees is higher in sites with higher mean temperatures. Species–area curves revealed that the number of woody species under pine and eucalypt plantations in Brazil is 606 and 598 species, respectively, over an aggregated sampled area of ca. 12 ha. We highlight that the understory of tree monocultures can harbor a considerable diversity of regenerating native species at the landscape and regional scales, but this diversity strongly depends on management. Long-rotation length and favorable location are key factors for woody regeneration success under tropical tree monocultures. Therefore, tree monocultures can play a role in forest landscape restoration and conservation, but only if they are planned and managed for achieving this purpose. © 2024 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Aim: Livestock production is among the main anthropogenic disturbances in seasonally dry tropical forests. However, its effects on plant functional composition in dry forests is poorly understood. Our goal was to analyze the variation in both functional composition and functional diversity of plant communities under goat grazing and at different ages of fallow in a tropical dry forest. Location: Brazilian dry forest (Caatinga) in Rio Grande do Norte State, northeastern Brazil. Methods: We measured the height, leaf area, and specific leaf area of all shrub-tree and herbaceous species along a gradient of stocking rate, years of grazing, and age of fallow. Additionally, we quantified the foliar contents of nitrogen, phosphorus, and tannins in the tree shrub layer. We tested the effects of grazing and deforestation using linear mixed models. Results: Our findings suggest that the functional diversity of plant communities in the Caatinga is not altered when goat grazing and secondary succession are examined independently. However, the interaction of both factors has affected the functional diversity, particularly in the herbaceous layer. Although grazing influenced specific traits in the shrub-tree layer, the overall functional diversity remained unaltered by grazing, succession, or their interaction. Conclusions: Grazing does not interfere with the natural succession process nor diminish the functional diversity of plant communities in the Caatinga. Therefore, with appropriate management, grazing can coexist with the conservation goals of the Caatinga. © 2024 International Association for Vegetation Science.

AB  - The rupture of Fundão Dam spilled contaminated tailings across the Doce river basin, severely damaging municipalities such as the urban Barra Longa and the rural Gesteira. The wave of tailings led to the sediment deposition in rivers margins, causing the loss of riparian forests and cropping areas. Sediment analyses confirmed the presence of toxic compounds (sodium and ether amine) and a very low fertility. In consequence, there was a sharp decline in agro-pastoral production in Gesteira, leading to land abandonment and rural exodus. In the urban area of Barra Longa, the wave of tailings damaged the urban floodplain and the square, which were rehabilitated using grey infrastructure. Alternatively, we proposed a new landscape recovery plan for both Barra Longa and Gesteira based on Nature and Community-based solutions that contemplate the inclusion of green infrastructure, the remediation of toxic compounds, the restoration of soil fertility, permeability and stabilization, riparian forest rehabilitation and the recovery of agro-pastoral productivity, ultimately aiming at reducing the flood risk and land abandonment. © 2025 The Author(s).

AB  - Fragments of the Atlantic Forest in secondary succession and with the presence of agricultural crops, are also home to stream protection areas and are places where initiatives such as the establishment of conservation units (CU) have been implemented. Identifying the different land covers and land uses within these areas is imperative for maintaining the forest, enhancing family farming and local and regional water sustainability. The aims of this research were (i) to identify the different vegetation covers and land uses in the surroundings of streams located within a CU in the Atlantic Rainforest of Pernambuco, NE Brazil; and (ii) test which of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index-NDVI or Enhanced Vegetation Index -EVI vegetation indices were the most effective for characterizing different vegetation covers. It was possible to verify two general categories of vegetation cover and land use: (i) dense ombrophilous Atlantic forest, with higher average NDVI (0.856) and EVI (0.535) in forest fragments with productive backyards of family farming and the polycultivation of species of agricultural interest; and (ii) soil with small sugarcane monoculture, with average NDVI (0.763) and EVI (0.507) corresponding to the area of capoeira 3 in the early stages of regeneration. The EVI indicated greater correspondence with the findings of the field activities, better differentiating the dense forest fragments from the other targets, such as agricultural crops and exposed soil. We found that there are fragments of dense Atlantic ombrophilous forest with a tendency for the NDVI and EVI vegetation indices to increase in three of the four soils around the streams surveyed, despite the presence of small-scale family farming in these areas. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2024.

AB  - The Parque Natural Municipal Paulo Gorski, located in western Paraná, comprises an urban remnant of Mixed Ombrophilous Forest. This study aimed to identify tree species and conduct the phytosociological characterization of this fragment of the Atlantic Forest. Monthly visits were made in ten plots (20 x 5 m) to collect fertile samples. A rarefaction curve was generated, and phytosociological parameters, diversity, and the distribution of individuals in diameter classes were calculated. A total of 158 tree individuals were sampled, distributed across 23 families and 47 species (including six exotic ones). Among the species found, 74.4% exhibited zoochoric dispersion syndrome, 19.1% anemochoric, and 6.5% autocoric. Concerning successional category, 63.8% were early successional species. Alchornea triplinervia (Spreng.) Müll.Arg. and Prunus myrtifolia (L.) Urb. had the highest importance values due to their high number of individuals, greater frequency, and basal area. Araucaria angustifolia (Bertol.) Kuntz, an endangered species, also had a high importance value. The Shannon diversity index was 3.43, and evenness was 0.89. Approximately 70% of the individuals were distributed in smaller diameter classes (< 15 cm), forming an inverted J-shape, an expected pattern indicating a regenerative capacity and structure of preserved forest remnants, despite being in an urban area and facing significant human pressures. This urban forest fragment should be preserved, as it contains native and endangered tree species from the region, serving as an ecological corridor, and maintains important ecological and social functions for the region. © (2023), (Universidade Federal do Parana).

AB  - Assisted Natural Regeneration (ANR) is a set of restoration strategies and interventions primarily based on natural regeneration, aimed at accelerating succession and providing multiple benefits in degraded ecosystems and landscapes. These strategies have the potential to significantly contribute to global Forest and Landscape Restoration efforts. However, ANR faces challenges due to limited recognition, support, and formal integration into relevant sectors and restoration policies, particularly in tropical regions. The dearth of evidence-based syntheses further compounds these challenges. To address this gap, a bibliometric analysis of selected scientific publications on ANR (n = 208) from 1987 to 2023 was conducted, using Web of Science and Google Scholar databases. A systematic review was undertaken, using a subset of original research articles (n = 44), to synthesize published data on interventions, contexts, costs, and benefits of ANR and to identify major knowledge gaps. Analysis of bibliometric metadata revealed an increasing annual output of ANR publications in over 80 journals, encompassing various document types and authors from over 40 countries. Despite ANR’s formal emergence in the Philippines, Brazil has taken the lead in both its research and implementation, and international collaboration in ANR research has grown. While ANR research focused mostly on ecosystem services and ecological outcomes, social aspects have been poorly studied. Diverse ANR interventions align not only with ecological restoration but also with integrated land management, biodiversity conservation, forest and landscape restoration, and forest management. The cost-effectiveness of ANR implementation, especially in restoration for carbon storage, exhibited considerable variability when compared to active tree planting, and varied with intervention types, time, land use history, and long-term costs. This synthesis provides critical insights and evidence to enhance the effective integration of ANR into restoration and reforestation programs and policies.

AB  - Capuchin monkeys are omnivorous platyrrhines with a high frequency of faunivory and can survive in urban forest fragments. Predation of wild vertebrates (high-quality foods) by capuchin monkeys has been frequently reported in many species of Cebus and Sapajus. However, predation of domestic animals is unknown. We describe a rare episode of predation, consumption, and sharing of an adult domestic chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus) by individuals from a social group of robust capuchin monkeys (Sapajus sp.) living in a small urban park in the city of Foz do Iguaçu, southern Brazil. This relatively large prey is freely farmed at the study site. The capture, slaughter, preparation (removal of feathers from the body), and consumption of the prey by the capuchins lasted 22 min. The dominant adult male ate the chicken’s head and tolerated the approach of two juveniles. The juveniles shared the remainder of the prey after the adult abandoned it. These juveniles scared other group members that approached the carcass. We recorded an opportunistic hunt for easily accessible domestic prey, a case of human resource use by urban primates that shared passively the atypical and valuable food. Though a rare event, the predation on a domestic animal indicates a potential source of conflict with humans that can have negative impacts on urban primates. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Japan Monkey Centre 2024.

AB  - Tropical insectivorous birds comprise a diverse group that has a distinct response to habitat degradation. However, knowledge on birds' ecological functions and their large-scale functional responses to human impacts across various habitats is scarce. We sampled 22 1-km-radius buffer landscapes within the Cantareira-Mantiqueira region (south-east Brazil), including native forests, pastures and marshes, to assess how landscape and habitat characteristics might affect insectivorous birds within the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. We studied whether bird species and functional diversity might respond to habitat turnover and nestedness and to native forest cover using generalized linear mixed models. We found negative effects of increased native forest cover on functional diversity indices. Bird communities in pastures show more nestedness, whereas marsh areas exhibit higher turnover. Forest areas receive a balanced contribution from both nestedness and turnover. These results are attributable to the predominantly secondary growth and early successional stages of the native forest fragments in the region, emphasizing the connection between landscape characteristics, habitat types and bird functional diversity in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest.  © The Author(s), 2024.

AB  - Purpose: The study characterised the dynamics of the natural regeneration process of urban remnants in four Curitiba (PR, Brazil) urban parks, aiming to contribute to the green infrastructure management process in Araucaria Forest areas. Theoretical framework: Urban forests offer significant socio-environmental benefits, being relevant for maintaining ecosystem services for cities and their inhabitants. Studying the regeneration of forest remnants in urban environments is essential for analysing their conservation status. Method/design/approach: The floristic diversity, structure, and population dynamics of the shrub-regenerating component of urban forest remnants were studied through the analysis of phytosociological parameters and the similarity between the shrub-regenerating, and arboreal components was verified. Results and conclusion: Significant dissimilarity was found between the study areas' regenerating shrub and tree components. The forest remnant of the Municipal Zoo, located in a locality with greater integration of different green areas, showed the best conservation status and a more advanced process of forest succession. Research implications: The analysis of the natural regeneration of urban remnants serves as an essential diagnosis regarding their conservation status and the capacity of species to perpetuate in the place, in addition to inferring about the connectivity with other urban remnants, being of great importance for the planning of actions aimed at the management of urban forests. Originality value: Analyzing natural regeneration generates information on forest remnants' conservation status and resilience, which is essential for planning actions for urban forest management. © 2023 ANPAD - Associacao Nacional de Pos-Graduacao e Pesquisa em Administracao.

AB  - Native tree plantation is one of the most common ecological restoration techniques used in tropical forests since it catalyzes ecological succession and contributes to the recovery of ecosystem processes. This study assessed the effect of functional trait composition (leaf area, specific leaf area, leaf dry matter content, leaf P, leaf C, leaf N, and wood density), functional diversity (functional richness, functional evenness, functional divergence, and Rao entropy), and aboveground biomass on soil properties in communities undergoing ecological restoration in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. The experiment was conducted in a native tree plantation with four treatments based on ecological species groups that were implemented 19 years ago. Structural equation models were used to assess the role of vegetation attributes (trait composition, functional diversity, and aboveground biomass) on soil properties (chemical properties, respiration, and microbial enzymatic activity). Our results showed that trait composition was a more important driver of changes in soil properties than functional diversity or aboveground biomass. The community-weight mean (CWM) of specific leaf area was negatively associated with soil carbon (-0.63) and soil microbial enzymatic activity (-0.77) and positively related to soil phosphorous content (0.72). Functional diversity (Rao entropy index) was negatively correlated with carbon microbial biomass (-0.89). Aboveground biomass alone did not explain changes in soil ecosystem processes. These results underscore the significance of using plant functional traits as an integrated tool to evaluate the links between below and aboveground components in restoration sites of tropical forests. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Passive restoration is widely adopted in restoration areas previously used by pine plantations. However, little is known about which environmental factors influence the initial natural regeneration in these areas. Our objective was to relate environmental variables to the floristic-structural patterns of early natural regeneration in areas under passive restoration post-harvest of Pinus taeda. We related natural regeneration data with vegetation and soil variables obtained in 19 plots (100 m2). The ordering of the floristic-structural data of natural regeneration was carried out by NMDS (Non-Metric Multidimensional Scaling) analysis, and the significant variables (p < 0.05) were plotted a posteriori. The results indicate that soil conditions are adequate for natural regeneration development in the study areas. The variables pH, clay, and canopy cover showed a relationship with the floristic-structural composition of the initial natural regeneration. These findings indicated a gradient of texture and acidity and a successional gradient among the sites. In general, tree species show an association with sites containing high canopy cover and soils of greater acidity and clay content. On the other hand, pioneer-shrub species predominate in sites with low canopy cover and soils that are less clayey and acidic. © 2024 Instituto de Pesquisas Jardim Botanico do Rio de Janeiro.

AB  - Accurate estimation of biomass in natural vegetation sites remains a challenge. Modeling biomass growth and production in Cerrado areas is crucial to understanding the vegetation succession process, especially regarding the changes in biomass accumulation over time. Thus, our objective was to model the growth and production of woody aboveground biomass (living and total) in a cerrado stricto sensu monitored for 27 years after implementing management systems. As expected, the basal area (with a diameter taken at 30 cm from the ground level) is the most important predictor variable and showed a higher correlation with the biomass stocks and allowed accurate and consistent estimates of these accumulated stocks over time. Future estimates of biomass production, generated from growth models that estimate production as a function of parameters observed at previous ages, indicate that maximum stocks of living (25.86 ± 0.15 Mg ha−1 [mean ± standard deviation]) and total aboveground biomass (26.11 ± 0.15 Mg ha−1) are expected for a period between 28 and 30 years after the implementation of the management systems, with maximum mean annual increment between 23 and 27 years. Furthermore, the systems of equations obtained simulated reductions up to 30% of biomass after the occurrence of a forest fire at 23 years. Thus, our study can be useful for the decision-making process and developing public policies and strategies for managing and conserving natural resources in the Cerrado biome. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Introduction: The soil seed bank is one of the most important ecological indicators for evaluating and monitoring the resilience of degraded ecosystems. Likewise, ecological restoration indicators are currently used in areas affected by the rupture of the Fundão tailings dam in Mariana, Minas Gerais, Brazil. Objective: To evaluate the seed bank at two depths of areas affected by mining tailings, Mariana municipality, Minas Gerais, Brazil. Methods: 15 samples (40 × 40 cm) were collected per level of depth, in the upper layer (Depth1, P1 = 0-2.5 cm), and lower layer (Depth2, P2 = 2.5-5.0 cm) of the mining tailings to survey the viable seed bank, which was later placed in a greenhouse for germination and seedling identification. The samples were placed in plastic trays to germinate in the nursery, then counted and identified weekly for six months. Results: The results showed that there is a seed bank in the surface layers of accumulated mining tailings in the affected areas of Mariana, with a marked difference between depths in terms of species richness and density of individuals. Higher species richness and number of individuals were observed in P1, (1 165 germinated seeds), belonging to 18 families and 47 species, in comparison to P2 (197 individuals), belonging to 12 families and 23 species. Probably the seed bank of layer P1 is influenced by the rain of seeds from the nearby forest. On the other hand, the P2 seed bank can be characteristic of mining tailings. Conclusions: Seed bank patterns can have positive effects on forest resilience at the local-scale, due to the high proportion of native, pioneer and anemochorical species of early successional stages. © 2021, Universidad de Costa Rica.

AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate growth along the stem of Araucaria angustifolia (Bertol.) Kuntze trees competing in overstocked stands, in order to identify periods when growth and trunk shape are differentiated during the trees' lifespan. The research was carried out in a planted forest of Araucaria angustifolia established in 1946 in the Açungui National Forest in Campo Largo, Paraná, Brazil, when these trees were 65 years old. One thinning was recorded, at some time between 1970 and 1980. Forty-six trees were selected and divided into three development classes (DC) at 65 years of age; these classes considered diameter at 1.30 m (breast height, dbh) with a range of 20 cm (from 10 cm to 70 cm). In addition to dbh, total tree height, and crown height and diameter were measured in the field. From each tree, 14 disks were removed to analyze growth rings and confirm the age of the stand. Some trees in the smallest DC (10 ≤ dbh < 30 cm) were the product of natural regeneration (younger trees that grew after the initial planting). In 63% of the trees, at least one growth ring was missing at breast height. Missing rings at breast height were more common in trees with smaller dbh and crown diameters. The need for more growing space was observed at different periods during the studied lifespan of the trees from three DCs. It resulted in changes in stems shape from conical to cylindrical. Different growth patterns could be observed during the lives of some trees as they outgrew their competition. © 2022 Elsevier GmbH

AB  - Urban green spaces have the reputation of limited potential to support biodiversity and public places located in urbanized regions normally sustain low levels of biodiversity. But there is the potential to improve such characteristics using restoration techniques that are easily implemented and cost-effective. In this study we implemented a set of nature-based interventions aiming to boost the local biodiversity of three urban parks in Sorocaba, SP, Brazil. Our interventions were designed to induce local ecological succession. In each park, we prepared nine sampling units (SU) by removing grass in a circle of 1 m diameter each. During the period of the study, three Sus in each park were kept uncovered (control treatment), three received -forest litter collected in an adjacent, well-conserved forest fragment (transposition treatment), and in the other three SUs, we installed a perch (perch treatment). For one year following establishment of the treatment, we monitored each SU biweekly and recorded the number and identity of seedlings that germinated in the circles. We recorded fluctuations in the number of seedlings in all experimental treatments of the three parks, indicating the variable rate of survivorship among species. We recorded a total of 30 different genera, most of which were herbaceous plants of species native to the region. In terms of the category of seed dispersion syndrome, most seedlings were from species dispersed by abiochoric vectors. Asteraceae was the most common botanical family. On one hand, if the experimental techniques we tested did not achieve the expected success in terms of the number of species of shrubs and trees, on the other hand, such interventions were not harmful in that they did not result in a predominance of exotic species. We conclude that this kind of approach has the potential to be successfully implemented in urban green spaces due to the simplicity of elaboration and implementation, respect of the natural structure and functioning (it is a nature-based alternative), and with an appropriate cost-benefit. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In this study we surveyed small mammals on a silvicultural landscape during the early second 7-year commercial cycle of Eucalyptus plantations in southeast Brazil. To do so we used the same method (pitfall traps) and part of the same sampling units used by a previous study during the early first commercial cycle. Our results suggest that Eucalyptus plantations are used as habitat by part of the original assemblage of small mammals along their commercial cycles. Four new species were detected on the second cycle but three were only detected on the first. In both cycles Eucalyptus plantations presented smaller abundance of small mammals than native vegetation and abandoned pastures around. Oligoryzomys nigripes (a species from the Atlantic forest) replaces O. flavescens and Calomys tener (species from Cerrado) from the first to the second commercial cycle. Species richness of the landscape matrix tend to remain lower than the native vegetation and abandoned pastures on the early second commercial cycle. Similarly to the first cycle, the species that use Eucalyptus plantations are not affected by the distance to the border of the conservation areas (i.e., native vegetation and abandoned pastures). The land sharing approach of the silvicultural sector in Brazil apparently prevented a higher small mammal species local extinction in relation to a former matrix of pastures. This provides a relevant conservation value to local silvicultural landscapes due to the role of small mammals in local trophic network. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

Currently, the sector accounts for 11.5% of Brazil’s GDP, and the country is the world’s fifth-largest producer of mining products. The environmental impacts of mining and other activities that compete for land use need to be evaluated. The objective of this work was to assess vegetation recomposition in an area where bauxite extraction occurred, using analysis of a vegetation index calculated from satellite images. The method was applied at a bauxite mine in Paragominas, Pará, Brazil. The evaluations covered the steps of opening the area, mining operations, and replanting, considering three types of replanting: natural regeneration, traditional planting, and nucleation, for the period between 2013 and 2019, using 2006 as the base situation for the secondary forest. The results showed that the replanting method directly influences the vegetation index according to satellite images. Several factors affected the values obtained, such as operational factors and topsoil used. The natural regeneration method was found to produce the best results.

AB  - Planting seedlings remains the most popular method of forest restoration, but passive restoration may become a new promise to reduce costs, despite concerns about its efficacy. Here, we present a study of a riparian forest recovery program in the Southern Atlantic Forest, Brazil. The objective was to compare planting seedlings and passive restoration eight years since restoration started and assess the influence of cattle presence in the restoring areas. We analyzed the structure, diversity, and composition of the woody community in the upper (canopy) and lower strata (understory) versus six environmental variables, including edaphic, landscape and geographical variables, restoration method (planting seedlings versus passive restoration), presence of cattle inside the restoration areas, and presence of adjacent crop plantations. Passive restoration generated a more diverse woody community and a higher proportion of climax and zoochoric species in the lower stratum than active restoration. Cattle presence was significantly associated with lower species richness and density of plants, as well as a higher proportion of pioneer species and low proportion of zoochoric and climax species. The results suggest that cattle can delay forest succession, besides reducing diversity. Passive restoration should be considered suitable for the region, and the efficiency of cattle exclusion needs to be improved. © 2021 Society for Ecological Restoration

AB  - The conversion of native forests into pastures is still a common practice in Brazil. Abandoned pastures have great potential for natural regeneration and therefore could play an important role in meeting the enormous demand for forest restoration. Few studies, however, have investigated the extent to which spatially-structured environmental variables and community structure are correlated with the variation in species abundance of regenerating forests on abandoned pastures. Therefore, we aimed to determine whether environmental and spatial variables were capable of explaining the variation in abundance of woody species on abandoned pastures in the subtropical Atlantic Forest. We systematically distributed 45 sample plots with size and inclusion criteria that changed according to the vegetation layer in three different abandoned pastures. In general, most of the variation in species abundance that our models were able to explain was correlated with spatially-unstructured physical-chemical soil properties. A smaller part of the variation was correlated with spatially-structured soil variables and topography-related variables. An even smaller portion of the variation was spatially-structured but was not correlated with spatially-structured environmental variables. Therefore, our results suggest that the variation in species abundance of regenerating subtropical Atlantic forests on abandoned pastures is more closely related to niche-based processes mediated by environmental variables than to stochastic spatial processes. © 2022 NISC (Pty) Ltd.

AB  - To counter increasing CO2 emissions and plant biodiversity loss, ecological restoration has been proposed as a means to sequester carbon as well as to increase species diversity in tropical landscapes. Here we examine how natural regeneration is associated with changing plant diversity and carbon stocks in the Atlantic Forest of southern Brazil. Aboveground carbon stocks and plant species diversity (using taxonomic, functional, phylogenetic and conservation metrics) were estimated in areas undergoing natural regeneration, ranging in age from seven to >80 years. Aboveground carbon, diversity and conservation metrics increase rapidly and concomitantly over time during forest natural regeneration, but even with carbon increase over time, we found the maximum taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity possible for the region. These results show the importance of considering regeneration as an alternative to increase carbon stocks, diversity, and species conservation in carbon-focused restoration plans. Our results showed co-benefits between carbon stocks, diversity, and conservation. Diversity (taxonomic, functional, and phylogenetic) increases along with carbon stocks, but functional evenness does not. Age of the areas also influences co-benefits, as they increase over time. Thus, we demonstrate that ecological restoration not only sequesters carbon and has benefits with respect to climate change but is also responsible for increasing biodiversity and conservation. This mutualism between different benefits of natural regeneration attends to a variety of international concerns. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Agroforestry is recognized as a friendly land-management practice because it can contribute to improve soil productivity, biodiversity conservation, ecosystem functions, climate change mitigation, landscape connectivity and the delivery of ecosystem services, optimizing livelihood benefits for people. The Atlantic Forest, a worldwide biodiversity hotspot, which presents large areas in natural regeneration and a promising scenario for ecological restoration has great potential for agroforestry. According to Brazilian legislation, the agroforestry conducted on remnants of Atlantic Forest depends on previous environmental authorization regarding both the vegetation management and the commercialization of native flora products. Although Brazilian legislation provides incentives for agroforestry, there are important barriers to its development regarding to the vegetation management for production, processing (enforcement of health and sanitation laws), and trading of timber and non-timber products. In the Rio Grande do Sul, the procedures for obtaining environmental authorization concerning the management and trading of native plants were too bureaucratic, unattractive, and infeasible for small rural landowners because the environmental legislation was not translated into effective public policies. Since the agroforestry and extraction of native flora products needs to comply with legislation and the key point is to guarantee the legal and sustainable origin of the products, and the management carried out, the appropriate procedure for the regularization of such practices is a certification of forest management. The SEMA's agroforestry certification (SAC) is a simplified procedure to legal compliance and sustainable management of native vegetation and mainly attends family farmers, indigenous peoples, maroons, and traditional populations. Until September 2019, nearly 130 landowners requested the SAC from 65 municipalities of Rio Grande do Sul. According to the applicants, around 99% of rural properties are considered small, ranging from 1.3 to 156 ha. Altogether, they add up to almost 380 ha of agroforestry in anthropic areas, some of them degraded by intense historical land use. The extraction of fruits and seeds and the planting of native tree species (59% and 48%, respectively) were the most mentioned agroforestry management by the applicants. The main products or species of interest mentioned were fruits and heart of palm from Euterpe edulis (52%), fruits of Citrus spp. (51%), native timber (49%), non-native fruits (44%), native Myrtaceae fruits (39%), other native fruits (32%), banana crops (29%), Yerba-mate (26%), non-native timber (16%), other non-native plants (9%), ornamental plants (9%), Butia catarinensis fruits (7%), and Butia odorata fruits (2%). The SAC has brought stakeholders (farmers, technical assistants, and researchers) closer to the environmental agency, creating a broad new regional agenda on agroforestry, and a myriad of conservation opportunities. The strengthening of agroforestry-support policies must be an important conservation strategy in the Atlantic Forest. However, to carry out such policies, it is necessary to create conditions and incentives beyond the legislative scope, translating the legal provisions to procedures and actions. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Mining is one of the main economic activities in the Amazon region, contributing substantially to the economy of countries that share its territory. This activity, however, brings environmental aftermaths as vegetation suppression, soil destruction, hydrological instability, and faunal displacement, making restoration of degraded ecosystems a challenge. In this sense, the objective of our study was to present the economic importance, the main restoration methods, and the bottlenecks to obtain successful restoration trajectories in degraded areas by industrial mining in the Amazon. We listed eight possible relevant procedures for successful restoration after mining and discussed worldwide adopted restoration methods such as seedling planting, inducing natural regeneration, hydroseeding, and nucleation. Despite the great development of restoration methods after mining, there are still barriers to obtain inputs, which include seedlings, and qualified labor to plan and develop restoration projects. These issues come in addition to operational restrictions, technical incapacity, deficient or inflexible legal basis, and lack of law enforcement. We suggest the selection of key species for planting, associated with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and biochar, establishment of lists with ecological indicators and reference values, usage of organic waste, and monitoring through unmanned aerial vehicles with high sensors resolution to correct revegetation failures and estimate aboveground biomass and carbon. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - How to best restore highly diverse tropical forests to deliver an affordable and effective legacy of biodiversity remains an ecological dilemma. We investigated both vegetation recovery and financial outcomes of forest restoration in applied nucleation and high-diversity plantation plots in the Atlantic forest of Brazil. We used a randomized block design with four replicates (40 × 54 m plots) for each of the two restoration treatments and a control (natural regeneration). After six years, we sampled 50% of the restored area and calculated all labor and input costs associated with both restoration establishment and maintenance. Overstory basal area, species richness and species diversity were highest in plantation and lowest in control plots. Understory density was also higher in plantation plots but density of shrubs and vines was higher in nucleation and control plots. There were no differences in understory species diversity or richness across treatments. When considering only recruited individuals, overstory density and basal area, and species richness in both over and understory was highest in nucleation plots. In comparison to plantation plots, the overstory composition of nucleation plots was more similar to control plots and there was greater variability across plots. The total cost of restoration was up to 34% cheaper in nucleation (US$ 4654.09 ha−1) than in the high-diversity plantations (US$ 7038.05 ha−1). While high-diversity plantation restoration is currently the most widespread and prevalent approach, applied nucleation appears to offer an intermediate level of recovery speed and cost, and can be a valuable strategy that can strike a balance between passive and active restoration. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The aim of the study was to evaluate the dynamics of vertical distribution of natural regeneration in a remnant Mixed Ombrophilous Forest. Two surveys were conducted for the study, in 2012 and subsequently in 2017, in a remnant forest area that has not been interfered for decades and is located in Santa Catarina (SC), Brazil. The experimental area comprised 20 circular plots of 2.5 m radius, where was it performed where the quantification of the regenerants, measurement of individual tree heights, and identification of the ecological group that each surveyed species belonged. We found natural regeneration in the remnant forest showed decreasing density values with the advancement of altimetric classes. In the survey carried out in 2012, the altimetric classes I, II and III recorded 48, 17 and 8 species, respectively. In the subsequent survey in 2017, the aforementioned classes recorded 60, 29 and 7 species, respectively. The distribution of regeneration guilds according to height classes revealed a predominance of individuals demanding light and a reduction in shade tolerants during the studied period. This result was probably influenced by specific disorders that occurred in the area during the study. © 2021 Universidade Federal Rural de Pernambuco. All rights reserved.

AB  - Restinga is an ecosystem associated mainly with the Atlantic Forest that can be defined as vegetation of the coastal plain established on sandy soil. This study was carried out in degraded areas of restinga in a Conservation Unit in São João da Barra, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. In 2012, a restoration project was initiated in the area, with implementation of plantings in hexagonal rings and artificial perches. Seedlings were planted in two contrasting situations: sandbanks (dry areas) and depression zones (areas prone to seasonal flooding). The objective of this study was to evaluate the performance of seedlings planted in both areas and accompany natural regeneration. We hypothesised that species planted and recruited in depressions should have better survival rates and increments in height (H) and diameter at the ground level (DGL) than the ones planted in sandbanks. Monitoring of planted seedlings was carried out in November 2016. Both communities had similar mortality (c. 50%). Greater increments in H were found for Inga laurina and Schinus terebinthifolia in depressions. Higher increments in DGL were observed especially for I. laurina, Inga vera and S. terebinthifolia with good performance in both areas. In general, seedlings planted in depressions showed greater performances, which can be related to higher water and nutrient availability. The most abundant natural regenerant species were Scoparia dulcis in sandbanks and S. terebinthifolia in depressions. A high number of regenerants was found associated with artificial perches, especially Cynophalla flexuosa, which demonstrates that the technique facilitated regeneration in the area. © 2021 Ecological Society of Australia

AB  - The Brazilian Atlantic forest is largely covered by secondary forests, mostly regenerated after the abandonment of patches previously used for shifting cultivation. A characteristic of these secondary forests is the significant timber volume from fast-growing species at ages as young as 30–40 years. In this study, we investigated changes that occur in timber production of secondary forest during the first 50 years of succession. We inventoried 82 plots (10 × 20 m) in a chronosequence ranging from 2 to 50 years since agricultural abandonment in four municipalities located in Santa Catarina State, Southern Brazil. Our results showed that commercial tree species have rapid recovery of richness, basal area and stem volume in naturally regenerating forests. Commercial species represent about 51 percent of tree diversity, with 9 out of 12 dominant species being commercial timber species, with a stem volume up to 155 m3 ha−1. Trees of commercial species with ≥15 cm in diameter are first observed after 20 years of succession, while trees ≥30 cm are found at 30 years of succession, and produce 126 m3 ha−1 of stem volume. We highlight Hyeronima alchorneoides, Miconia cabucu and Miconia cinnamomifolia, as fast-growing dominant species that produce timber quality ≥20 cm in diameter after 20 years of succession, with volume reaching 200 m3 ha−1 before 40 years of succession. We found that secondary forests are dominated by fast-growing and wood-producing species, with a rapid increase in timber stocks in the early stages of succession. These secondary forests are important biodiversity reservoirs in human-pressured landscapes, in addition to providing forest products and other ecosystem services. The management of secondary forests may be an alternative restoration approach that can accelerate the recovery of timber stocks, provide landscape diversity, and add more value to private forests. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Background: The commonly used methods for the financial evaluation of plantation forest investment projects do not incorporate uncertainties and ignore the value related to flexibility. The real options analysis makes it possible to capture these values in investment projects, increasing their value and return. Despite this, studies involving real options in forest investment projects are scarce, specifically those related to Pinus spp. Therefore, this study aimed to: (a) analyze whether the real options analysis adds value to investment projects of Pinus elliottii Engelm. plantations; and (b) make the real options analysis more accessible to forest managers and potentially increase its use in the investment projects of Pinus spp. plantations. Methods: We evaluated two investment projects in P. elliottii plantations in southern Brazil, which differed in the way of obtaining the land for planting: with lease or purchase of land on a planning horizon of 21 years. In the real options analysis, we used deferral, expansion, and abandonment. Results: Individually, the deferral, expansion, and abandonment options add value to investment projects in Pinus elliottii plantations. The option to expand the forested area is one that adds the most value to the investment project with land lease. In the investment project with land purchase, it is abandonment. Conclusions: Investment projects in Pinus elliotti plantations that contemplate the land purchase analyzed through the real options analysis present higher financial returns than those that consider land lease, inverting the result provided by the traditional analysis. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Currently, about a third of the world's forest areas that have been deforested are regrowing. These second-growth forests (SGF) promote carbon stocks and tree species richness recovery (co-benefits recovery), which is central to mitigating the negative impact of climate change and loss of biodiversity. In Brazil's Atlantic Forest, second-growth forests that are regrowing after long-term land use can recover diversity and carbon and can have important carbon-tree diversity co-benefits. Thus, we evaluate the recovery of tree species richness and above-ground carbon stock (AGC) in SGF that are regrowing after a long-period of eucalyptus plantations. For this we sampled 43 SGF with stand ages varying from 1−32 years after eucalyptus plantations cutting and three reference old-growth forests (OGF). We considered all individuals with more than 15 cm of circumference at breast height in one 20 × 50 m plot by patch. We identified all tree species, which were categorized into functional attributes, such as zoochoric and non-zoochoric, pioneer and shade-tolerant, and fleshy and dry fruits species. There were marked differences in species richness and AGC between OGF and SGF, but SGFs were not different between then. However, in 32 years these second-growth forests recovered ∼38% of species richness and ∼14% of carbon stock of old-growth forests. In addition, there was a carbon-biodiversity co-benefits mainly between zoochoric and shade-tolerant species richness. These results showed that these second-growth forests could naturally recover biodiversity and AGC. Possibly, this is due to the connectivity provided by land-use for eucalyptus plantations that induces favorable conditions for the recruitment of zoochoric and shade-tolerant species and thus for the recovery of biodiversity and AGC after eucalyptus cutting. Thus, this second-growth forest management can contribute to Atlantic Forest biodiversity conservation and carbon stock initiatives. © 2021

AB  - Soil is the principal habitat and reservoir of fungi that act on ecological processes vital for life on Earth. Understanding soil fungal community structures and the patterns of species distribution is crucial, considering climatic change and the increasing anthropic impacts affecting nature. We evaluated the soil fungal diversity in southeastern Brazil, in a transitional region that harbors patches of distinct biomes and ecoregions. The samples originated from eight habitats, namely: Semi-deciduous forest, Brazilian savanna, pasture, coffee and sugarcane plantation, abandoned buildings, owls’ and armadillos’ burrows. Forty-four soil samples collected in two periods were evaluated by metagenomic approaches, focusing on the high-throughput DNA sequencing of the ITS2 rDNA region in the Illumina platform. Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) was used for vegetation cover analysis. NDVI values showed a linear relationship with both diversity and richness, reinforcing the importance of a healthy vegetation for the establishment of a diverse and complex fungal community. The owls’ burrows presented a peculiar fungal composition, including high rates of Onygenales, commonly associated with keratinous animal wastes, and Trichosporonales, a group of basidiomycetous yeasts. Levels of organic matter and copper influenced all guild communities analyzed, supporting them as important drivers in shaping the fungal communities’ structures. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Key message: The allometric relationships of tropical trees change along ontogeny and ecological succession at the level of populations and communities. Abstract: Tree size and shape can influence their survival and growth, affecting the community dynamics. In this study, we explored how the tree allometric relationship is altered along in the succession of a tropical forest. We measure stem diameter (SD), total height (H), crown volume (CV) of juvenile, and adult trees in areas of 7–17, 20–30, 35–55, and > 80 years of Atlantic Forest in Brazil. The study was carried out for the community (all individuals were considered) and population (the most abundant species). We tested allometric relationships between H, SD and CV with the standardized major axis function. The results indicate that, in general, successional gradient establishes conditions that affect the way resources are invested in trees, despite variations among the type of allometric relationship, the ontogenetic phase, the successional stage and species considered. There are tendencies in individuals becoming taller, and proportionally, with crowns less voluminous along the succession. Variations in height, stem diameter and crown investment along the successional gradient suggest that shade tolerance is the main driver affecting the ontogenetic niche and shaping tree allometry. These results suggest that the successional age and the ontogeny of the individuals affect plant dynamics, and possibly, the coexistence of the species. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Natural regeneration of forests has significantly led to increased native forest cover in some regions. Several studies have explored the spatial drivers of forest cover increase, yet little is known about their effects on forest structure and species richness and diversity. We quantified the effects of local (forest age, remnant Eucalyptus basal area, slope, soil fertility, and clay content) and landscape drivers (surrounding land use, distance from streams, and surrounding forest cover and its change over time) on the aboveground biomass, species density, and phylogenetic diversity of native trees in second-growth forests. We sampled 44 naturally regenerating forests established on former pastures and abandoned Eucalyptus plantations for 11–46 years in agricultural landscapes of the southeastern Atlantic Forest, Brazil. We used generalized linear mixed effect models to quantify the effect drivers on forest attributes. While only Eucalyptus basal area and proximity to sugarcane plantations had a consistent negative effect on forest biomass, other drivers were among the best models to explain forest attributes, but their effect was variable. Age increased tree biomass but the effect was not consistent. Similarly, species richness and phylogenetic diversity were mainly affected by landscape drivers such as surrounding forest cover. In tropical agricultural landscapes, effective forest recovery requires more than just time, as forest age can be less important in determining forest attributes than human land uses and surrounding native forest cover. Crucially, forest recovery can be improved through interventions and policies that promote less impactful human activities and enhance existing forest cover.

AB  - Forest fragmentation is the main cause of biodiversity loss in the Anthropocene and it is triggering a top-down cascade effect that may influence leaf litter decomposition. However, the link between biodiversity loss and changes in ecosystem processes is not fully understood. We conducted an experiment to evaluate whether the exclusion of vertebrates affects the decomposition rates of different litter types (grass, a pioneer species and a mix of litters from a well preserved secondary forest). To answer this question, we placed litter bags inside artificial exclusion plots that were built in two types of vegetation coverage (abandoned pastureland and preserved forest) in the Atlantic forest of southeast Brazil. Our hypothesis is that vertebrate exclusion will change decomposition rates of different litter types due to the top-down cascade effect on soil invertebrates. We found out that vertebrate exclusion did not affect decomposition rates, possibly due to the overlap of ecological functions in the soil fauna responsible for the decomposition process. Furthermore, grass litter was decomposed faster (k value), possibly due to its initial nutrient content and hence litter quality which plays a significant role on decomposition rates. © 2021, International Society for Tropical Ecology.

AB  - Swidden agriculture as a production system has been practiced for thousands of years, based on ecological processes of forest ecosystems. While this cultivation system has often been framed as contributing to environmental degradation, it can also be argued to be compatible with sustainable agricultural practices. Its sustainability strongly depends on the length of the recovery period, the period of secondary forest succession, after swidden agriculture. In this study we focused on soil fertility maintenance and recovery during secondary succession after swidden agriculture, compared to old-growth forests. Smallholders practiced a moderate form of swidden agriculture, abandoned the production field after one or two production cycles, and returned to the field after 10–15 years. Sampling took place in two traditional communities situated in the southeast portion of the Atlantic Rainforest at São Paulo state, Brazil. Soil samples were collected from forest fragments belonging to seven different Caiçara families (descendants from Amerindians, African Brazilian and European colonizers). Our chronosequence spanned a period of sixty years, while the old-growth forests were 100 years old. In all 28 sites were sampled, of which 19 were from ombrophilous forests on clay and 9 from restinga vegetation on sandy soil. Soils were analyzed for texture, macro- and micronutrient availability, bulk density, pH and nitrogen and carbon stocks. Linear regression, with clay content and fallow period as main factors, showed that successional age of the forest stand had only a significant effect on pH and Mn. Clay content of the soil influenced availability of nutrient bases and the CEC. Other soil properties, including stocks of carbon and nitrogen were not influenced by fallow period. Our data indicate that swidden agriculture might not lose key soil nutrients over time and hence can be considered an ecologically sustainable system in the region, challenging the negative perception of swidden agriculture. © 2020 The Author(s)

AB  - The present study aimed to evaluate some chemical and physical attributes of the soil, as well as the litter accumulated above ground in two areas at different fallow times after pebble and sand exploration, compared to a secondary forest. The study was carried out in the municipality of Capitão Poço, Pará, Brazil. Each study area has about 5 ha. The three areas are composed of a forest fragment (FOR), a mined area with fallow of 48 months (DA48) and an area mined in a period of 18 months (DA18). The variables analyzed were soil density, soil particle density, soil fertility and litter physical quality. FOR obtained higher values of litter biomass in almost all factors analyzed. Just the water holding capacity of the litter in this area together with the weight of the fresh straw. In general, it was observed that it is more appropriate to use the fallow observed in the DA18 area for intervention through recovery practices to take advantage of natural regeneration. © 2023 Federal University of Mato Grosso.

AB  - The present study aimed to determine how plant functional traits change both at the intra- and interspecific levels along three successional stages (early, intermediate and late) in a Brazilian tropical dry forest (TDF). Plants in early-successional plots are expected to exhibit conservative traits to increase photoprotection and water conservation, whereas late successional plants would invest on acquisitive traits. Sampling was conducted in three plots of 50 × 20 m per successional stage, where plant species composition and structural parameters were previously determined for individuals with DBH ≥ 5 cm. From each of three plots, the five tree species with the highest importance values were selected. This resulted in a total of 13 species from seven families selected for this study. We quantified specific leaf area (SLA), leaf slenderness, polyphenols and chlorophyll contents, and leaf lifespan. Based on leaf traits, we detected two major tree functional species groups: the early-intermediate and the late successional groups. Confirming our expectations, the former was positively associated with drought tolerance traits (polyphenols and slenderness) related to conservative resource use; and the latter was positively associated with acquisitive traits (SLA). This pattern was partially corroborated at the intraspecific level for species that occurred in more than one successional stage. We found a weak phylogenetic signal for the functional grouping (only for polyphenols). The analysis of variance structure across scales indicated that a very small proportion (up to 2.8%) of the general variance in leaf traits occurred at intraspecific level suggesting that, compared to interspecific variations, trait differences among individuals due to phenotypic plasticity are low. Although further studies with a larger number of species are needed, our findings suggest a decoupling between functional and structural/species composition regeneration, contradicting several studies on secondary succession where species composition is regarded as the main indicator of the regeneration of ecological functions. © 2021 Elsevier GmbH

AB  - Environmental monitoring of small, rural watersheds was one of the components of the Natural Resources Management and Rural Poverty Alleviation Program (RS-Rural) in southern Brazil. The purpose of the monitoring was to assess the impact of promoting soil conservation and environment management practices adopted by farmers and funded by the Program. In four small monitored watersheds, in a total of 95 plots representing distinct land use and soil management, surface soil was collected to characterize ground-zero of the Program by determining several soil physical, chemical and microbiological properties. Principal component analysis (PCA) shows soil physical, chemical and biological properties were decisive in defining the agricultural soils in the rural watersheds with family farming. The sensitivity to chemical properties provides an opportunity to improve soil quality if soil management focuses on altering those properties. Soil management practiced by tobacco farmers leads to rapid, intense degradation of some natural soil properties, especially those related to the dynamics of soil organic matter, compared with more conservationist uses (forest, regrowth, and grassland). Thus, soil management must be reoriented to avoid the progress of degradation and recover soil physical and biological quality. Cover crops and by land-abandonment to allow natural vegetation are important management strategies for the degraded soils used for tobacco production, increasing soil organic matter, nutrients and microbial activity and thus allowing further crop production. In conclusion, watersheds with tobacco cropping have soils with lower quality than when under no-tillage grain production, requiring changes in land use and soil management. © 2021 International Research and Training Center on Erosion and Sedimentation, China Water & Power Press

AB  - Leaf traits are good indicators of ecosystem functioning and can affect herbivory and leaf reflectance patterns, allowing a better understanding of changes in environmental conditions, such those observed during forest natural regeneration. The aim of this study was to evaluate the intraspecific variation in leaf traits and their influence on the pattern of herbivory and leaf reflectance in three species distributed along a successional gradient (early, intermediate and late stages) in a tropical dry forest (TDF) in northern Minas Gerais, Brazil. We sampled individuals of the following abundant tree species that occurred in multiple successional stages: Cenostigma pluviosum, Handroanthus ochraceus, and Tabebuia reticulata. We collected 10 leaves from each tree to determine the contents of chlorophyll a, b, and total, carotenoids and water, as well as the percentage of leaf area removed by herbivores and leaf specific mass (LSM). We also measured five spectral reflectance indices (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index-NDVI, Simple Ratio-SR, modified Normalized Difference-nND, modified SR-mSR and Water Index-WI) using a portable spectrometer. Our results showed intraspecific differences in most leaf traits along the successional gradient, suggesting that local adaptation may play an important role in plant community assembly. However, herbivory only differed for H. ochraceus in early and intermediate stages, but it was not affected by the leaf traits considered here. Spectral reflectance indices also differed among successional stage for all species together and for each species separately, except for T. reticulata in intermediate and late stages. Thus, leaf spectral signatures may be an important tool to the remote detection of different successional stages in TDFs, with implications for forest management.

AB  - The Montane Ombrophilous Dense Forest belongs to Atlantic Forest’s domain, an important biodiversity hotspot. In Brazil, most of the invasion reports are related to terrestrial plants, being this forest the most affected. In this context is the Cantareira State Park (PEC), Sao Paulo. The PEC is home to a remnant that has a focus of invasion by several plant species, including Livistona chinensis (N.J. Jacquin) R. Brown ex Mart., known as Chinese Fan Palm. Given the potential for invasion of this species, a floristic-phytosociological study was conducted in order to analyse a possible inhibition effect in the natural regeneration process of the arboreous component caused by juveniles individuals of Livistona chinensis, with heights varying between 3 and 6 m. For each palm were installed 8 plots of 1 x 1 m, placed in quadrants, with the palm’s stipe in the center, in a way that half of the plots were placed under the canopy and half around the palm. In the analysis were considered arboreal and palms specimens ≥ 20 cm in height and with a Perimeter at Breast Height (PAP) ≤ 15 cm. The results pointed to a drastic reduced number of seedlings and saplings (28.95% and 29.85%) and of the species richness (16.13% and 8.33% of species) occurring under the canopies of these exotic palm trees in comparison with the surroundings (71.05% and 70.15% of the sampled individuals; and 61.29% and 58.33% of species, respectively). The study has shown the inhibiting effect of young individuals of this species on the forest regeneration in the PEC, by substantially reducing the richness of species and the abundance of arboreal individuals under the projection of their canopies, possibly because they serve as a shield and cause excessive shading of the place. © 2022, Universidade Federal de Santa Maria.

AB  - We evaluated the effects of riparian forests restoration on anuran communities in the Brazilian Cerrado. We analyzed five riparian reforested fragments around a reservoir of an hydroelectric plant using microhabitat variables (humidity, canopy opening, amount of leaf litter and vegetation density), the dominant landscape (matrix type, fragment width) and reforestation age. We tested whether anuran abundance, richness and diversity were influenced by these variables using generalized linear models. Matrix type and fragment width were limiting factors for anurans to reach and establish themselves in riparian forest fragments, whereas microhabitat and reforestation age did not influence anuran succession. We conclude that reforestation in the midst of impermeable matrices creates anuran communities dominated by widely-distributed species that live in open areas, reflecting the highly modified surrounding habitat. © 2022 Copyright 2022 by Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, The Netherlands.

AB  - Planted forests are long-term projects involving a large monetary contribution, and generally require the incorporation of managerial flexibility. As the traditional methodology for economic evaluation does not allow for the incorporation of these flexibilities, our study aimed to analyze whether investment projects in planted forests of Pinus elliottii Engelm. are economically feasible, by applying a real options analysis. We used empirical data from one hectare of a planted forest of P. elliottii with a 14-year planning horizon. Managerial flexibilities were incorporated in combinations and also separately, as options to defer, expand or abandon the investment project. Through Monte Carlo simulation, the present value of USD 1.016 was conditioned to anticipated return values from the second to the fourteenth year, with a volatility return of 14.5%. With real options analysis, the value of the combined options was USD 29, which, in terms of traditional net present value, showed an expanded net present value of USD 468. The real options analysis thus shows that investment projects in planted forests of P. elliottii are economically feasible. Given that real options analysis is a methodology not widely used in the forestry sector for economic analysis of investment projects, this study can be used to assist forest managers in analysing investment risks and decisions, specifically those related to market fluctuations of planted forests of Pinus spp., assuming that the real options of deferral, expansion and abandonment of an investment project are used. © 2022, Bois et Forêts des Tropiques.

AB  - Joannesia princeps, popularly known as a cutieira, is a Euphorbiaceae endemic to Brazil and its wood is used for various industrial purposes and the seed has approximately 37% of useful oil for industrial and medicinal purposes, besides presenting outstanding importance in ecological succession in degraded areas, whose seeds serve as food for agoutis. The objective was to study germination, phenology and morphometry of fruits, seeds and seedlings of Joannesia princeps. We used 1,000 fruits of Joannesia princeps harvested from 40 matrices of Atlantic Forest surrounding Caparaó, which make up an existing forest in the Municipal Garden of the city of Alegre, in Espírito Santo state, in which qualitative attributes were analyzed in relation morphology. In the biometric analysis, the following were analyzed: length, diameter and thickness and seedling analyses were conducted periodically on the 6th, 7th, 14th, 21th, 28th, 35th and 42th days after germination (DAG), using four replicates of 15 normal and healthy seedlings for descriptions. It was observed that the roots have changed their color of whitish for yellowish-white between the 14th and 21st DAG, while the hypocotyl, in the initial presented reddish color passing to green after the 14th DAG. The other organs did not present considerable changes, however, biometrically, all organs showed an increase in their dimensions, according to the evolution of development. The morphological features described and illustrated were stable, and therefore, informative for the characterization and identification of the species in the germination process and in the first stages of development. © 2022, Universidade Federal de Santa Maria.

AB  - Our aims were to describe the role of the selective management of regenerating community (RC) on the recovery of ecosystem functions in production areas of African mahoganies under mixed stands and agroforestry systems, established on abandoned farmland. A randomized block experiment was set up with the following treatments: (T1) mixed-plantation of African mahogany under conventional system (including herbicide application); (T2) mixed-plantation of African mahogany with selective conduction of RC; (T3) agroforestry system with African mahogany; (T4) agroforestry system with African mahogany with selective conduction of RC. The parameters of horizontal structure, diversity and ecological attributes of species of the regenerating community were studied. In addition, the production of aboveground biomass and nutrient stocks, soil fertility, and soil microbial activity were assessed. In T1, herbicide application (glyphosate) affected the floristic composition of the regenerating community by reducing the dominance of monocots and Pteridium arachnoideum, allowing the regeneration of other taxonomic groups of herbaceous species. In response, there was a reduction in the litter biomass stock comparing to the other treatments. The treatments with selective management of the RC (T2 and T4) produced more biomass and accumulated higher amounts of C and nutrients than the conventional treatments (T1 and T3). These treatments also allowed other shrub and tree species to overcome the ecological filter imposed by grasses and colonize the experimental area. Baccharis dracunculifolia, Vismia guianensis, Cecropia pachystachya and Inga sp. were the most important regenerating species that contributed most to the stocks of all nutrients in living aboveground biomass. Pruning and selective management in T4 increased the soil effective cation exchange, while in the T1 treatment there was a lower activity of the β-glucosidase enzyme. The selective management of RC in agroforestry systems through the manipulation of competitive relationships allowed the colonization of native tree and shrubby species that provide several additional ecosystem services, including pollination, fauna attraction, food production, pest control and environmental regulation for the agroecosystem. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Human-induced wildfires are increasing in frequency in tropical forests, and their deleterious consequences for biodiversity include decreases in seed rain, which may be affected directly by fire or indirectly by the creation of edges between forest and non-forest environments. Understanding seed rain is key to assess the potential for natural regeneration in plant communities. We assessed the impact of fire and fire-created edges on seed rain species richness, abundance, size, weight, and dispersal syndromes in Atlantic Forest remnants in Bahia, Brazil. We assessed seed rain at monthly intervals for an entire year along seven 300 m-long transects placed perpendicular to the edge. We installed seed traps at the edge and at 20, 40, 60, 80, 100, and 150 m into the burnt area and into the forest from forest edge. We recorded a total of 9050 seeds belonging to 250 morphospecies. We did not observe edge influence; however, we detected a lower abundance and proportion of animal-dispersed seeds in the burnt than in the unburnt areas. The seed abundance in the burnt areas was lower and seeds were smaller and lighter than those in the unburnt area. Seed rain in the burnt area was not greater near to the forest than far from it. The abundance and richness of seed rain was positively correlated with tree density. Our findings highlight the lack of seed rain in burnt areas and differences in community composition between the burnt and unburnt areas. Collectively, these results indicate negative consequences on natural regeneration, which can lead to permanent secondarization of the vegetation and challenges for early regeneration of burnt areas, which will initially have impoverished forests due to low seed richness. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - Question: Is there a decrease in the richness, structural variables and composition similarity of woody Cerrado species with habitat–matrix distance, potentially influenced by soil compaction and propagule dispersal strategies in the pasture matrix?. Location: We studied three landscapes of a pasture matrix in areas of the Cerrado biome in southwestern São Paulo, Brazil. Methods: We sampled 110 plots of 2 m × 2 m in the matrix, stratified in ranges perpendicular to the edge of the habitat, and 10 plots in the forest with no edge effect (60 m from the edge). We undertook soil sampling and collected information about the plants (taxonomy, height, circumference and establishment form by germination or resprouting). We defined habitat distance as the predictor variable for the following response variables: abundance, richness, establishment form, mean height, mean diameter at soil height and dispersal syndrome of the individuals sampled; in addition to the porosity and bulk density of the sampled soil. Results: We found significant differences between habitat and matrix for abundance, richness, mean height and germination number, but non-significant differences for resprouting number and mean diameter at soil height. There was no relationship regarding matrix–habitat distances for structural variables, and habitat species composition was similar only for the first 10 m distance from the habitat edge. Conclusion: Pasture did not prevent plant establishment but might act as an environmental filter. Pasture matrices modify the composition and diversity of the plant community compared with the Cerrado community. Pastures are dominated by resprouting, autochory and grassland species. Regenerating plants from the propagule bank of the matrix showed the potential for natural regeneration of Cerrado areas in pasture as a restoration strategy. © 2022 International Association for Vegetation Science.

AB  - Context. The Caatinga biome, located in the Brazilian semiarid region, has few remnants of riparian forest. Thus, it is essential to know the effectiveness of strategies aimed at forest recovery. Aims. The objective of this study was to investigate the use of the epigeal fauna as a bioindicator tool of soil quality and ecosystem sustainability to determine the best native forest restoration strategy in the Caatinga in Belém do São Francisco, Pernambuco, Brazil. Methods. In areas previously dominated by Prosopis juliflora (Sw.) DC., three treatments were installed: conventional planting of native species (P), planting of native species in islands (applied nucleation, N), and natural regeneration (NR). These restoration treatments were compared with an area of high P. juliflora dominance (PJ). Epigeal fauna were captured in two periods of the year (wet and dry seasons) using pitfall traps in a completely randomised design. We estimated the total abundance, richness, diversity, and evenness, as well as the trophic guilds of the epigeal fauna. Key results. The epigeal fauna organisms were distributed in 22 taxonomic groups. The Saprophagous Diplopoda group was exclusive to PJ. The Predator Pseudocorpionida group was not observed in the NR area in any period. Cluster analysis revealed more dissimilarity of the NR with the other areas. Conclusions. In the short term (less than 2 years), P increased the diversity and richness of the epigeal fauna and promoted better structuring of the Microphagous/ Saprophagous (Entomobryomorpha, Poduromorpha, and Symphypleona) trophic guild, while NR promoted better structuring of the Herbivorous (Auchenorryhncha and Heteroptera) and Saprophagous/Predator (Formicidae and Coleoptera) trophic guilds. Implications. In the short term, conventional planting benefited the epigeal fauna due to the high diversity of planted species. © 2023 The Author(s) (or their employer(s)).

AB  - Deforestation and the disorderly exploitation of natural resources for agricultural expansion occurred at an accelerated pace in the Brejo microregion of the state of Paraíba, Brazil, which resulted in abandonment and erosion of the soil in a large part of the region. In view of this scenario, the present study was undertaken to investigate the soil respiration in systems involving different forms of land use and cover in caatinga enclaves moist forests (Brejo de Altitude areas). The study was conducted in four land use and cover systems, namely, pasture, mandala agriculture, agroforestry system, and forest. Microbial activity was estimated by quantifying the carbon dioxide (CO2) released in the soil respiration process, from the soil surface, and captured by KOH solution. Soil temperature (°C) and water content (%) were monitored simultaneously with the analysis of soil respiration. The forms of land use and cover have a direct effect on the metabolic activity of soil organisms, and climatic factors such as soil temperature and moisture influence the dynamics of organic matter decomposition and, consequently, the release of CO2. The production of CO2 is higher at night than during the day, regardless of the analyzed systems. Among the evaluated areas, the forest showed the lowest CO2 emissions, so it was considered a CO2 receptor in contrast to the pasture area, which functioned as a CO2 emitter. Management techniques that reduce surface temperature and increase organic matter should be prioritized to promote soil biota. © 2022 Universidade Estadual de Londrina. All rights reserved.

AB  - An estimated 90 to 95% of Indigenous people in Amazonia died after European contact. This population collapse is postulated to have caused decreases in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations at around 1610 CE, as a result of a wave of land abandonment in the wake of disease, slavery, and warfare, whereby the attendant reversion to forest substantially increased terrestrial carbon sequestration. On the basis of 39 Amazonian fossil pollen records, we show that there was no synchronous reforestation event associated with such an atmospheric carbon dioxide response after European arrival in Amazonia. Instead, we find that, at most sites, land abandonment and forest regrowth began about 300 to 600 years before European arrival. Pre-European pandemics, social strife, or environmental change may have contributed to these early site abandonments and ecological shifts. © 2021 The Authors, some rights reserved; exclusive licensee American Association for the Advancement of Science.

AB  - Aims: Although monodominance has attracted the attention of ecologists for many decades, few studies have devoted attention to how abiotic factors could influence the occurrence of monodominant forest patches at the biome scale. Here, we assessed whether the occurrence of monodominant forest patches of Moquiniastrum polymorphum (Less.) G. Sancho (Asteraceae), an early-successional tree species with wind-dispersed seeds, could be predicted using optimum germination temperature and past deforestation. We also verified under what edaphic and climatic conditions the species could reach monodominance. Location: The Atlantic Forest, Brazil. Methods: We estimated optimum germination temperature across the species’ geographic range as a function of annual mean temperature based on the results of germination tests available in the literature. Past deforestation (a proxy for suitable habitat for the species’ dispersal and establishment) around monodominant forest patches was estimated by calculating the forest cover in 1985. We also modeled the upper limit of dominance (relative abundance) as a function of climatic and edaphic variables considered important for the species’ establishment. Results: The results showed that the probability of occurrence of monodominant forest patches is statistically null in places where germination can take more than 10 days and the landscape had more than 20% forest cover. Relative density values for the monodominant condition (> 60%) occurred only in warmer regions with infertile soils and median precipitation conditions (ca. 1,075–1,700 mm per year) in the Atlantic Forest. Conclusion: We conclude that only under optimal conditions of germination and dispersal (i.e., regeneration niche) does monodominance occur. This highlights germination traits as an important mechanism for regulating monodominance. In addition, the approach used to predict regions with optimum germination temperature has further implications for understanding species abundance and distribution more generally. © 2022 International Association for Vegetation Science.

AB  - – The floodplains of meandering rivers in southeastern Brazil represent places where the sedimentary record associated with the history of transition/ecotone areas and exchange of biomes accumulates, such as the Cerrado (Cerradão Forest) and Atlantic Forest (Semideciduous-Riparian Forest). The present study aims to use palynological, isotopic (δ13C, δ15N and14C), and anthracological indicators in cores taken from three abandoned meander bends to make inferences about environmental evolution, vegetation reconstruction, and climatic inferences. The study area is located in the Mogi Guaçu River Basin, in the countryside of São Paulo State. The studies show that ~2,730 BP (stage I), the area underwent through a more humid climatic phase compared to the current one, which allowed the expansion of the Riparian Semideciduous Forest. After that date, in stage II (1,800 to 510 BP), the percentage of the Cerrado (Cerradão Forest) increased, due to a drier period. From 510 BP to the present day (stage III), humidity has taken place with a new expansion of the Riparian Semideciduous Forest, although elements of Cerrado are present. Microscopic charcoal fragments were found in all stages and may infer the incidence of paleo-wildfires during the Late Holocene. The results indicate that both phytophysiognomies remained for the studied period, varying their expansion depending on the humidity present in each stage. Although lakes formed by abandoned meanders are not areas with the best palynological record, they are frequent environments in the interior of the continents. If properly interpreted, they may provide relevant information to vegetation and climatic changes for the areas. © 2021, Sociedade Brasileira de Paleontologia. All rights reserved.

AB  - The colonization of Brazil by Portugal left deep marks in Brazil’s current society and economy. The same applies to the country’s biodiversity, with several introduced plants persisting as naturalized or invasive species. Among these, the tea plant, Camellia sinensis, is a notable case. The species was first cultivated in Rio de Janeiro state during the 19th century, but the crops were later abandoned mostly due to the presence of parasite fungi in cultivations, so that the species’ cultivation continued in other states only. During recent fieldwork in the Atlantic Forest in the municipality of Petrópolis, Rio de Janeiro state, naturalized individuals of the tea plant were discovered. This finding, alongside ecological evidence, highlights a new threat to the biodiversity of an area of high species endemism. We provide historical information on the introduction of the species in Brazil and discuss the threats it imposes to the flora in a world hotspot. Our finding adds C. sinensis to the list of naturalized plants of Flora do Brasil 2020 and emphasizes the importance of monitoring the invasive potential of the species in the area, given its allelopathic potential on the germination of other species and competition with native plants. © 2022Author.

AB  - The need to put into practice sustainable agricultural production systems has been supported by agroecology science that seeks to optimize land use to food production with the lowest impact on soil. This study evaluated soil quality, based on physical and chemical attributes, in agroforestry (AGF) and silvopastoral (SILVP) systems developed for large-scale food production. The study was carried out in the municipality of Itirapina, state of São Paulo, in two areas with AGF and SILVP system, compared to an area with a forest fragment and another with pasture in a Quartzipisamment Sand Neosol. The soil collections were carried out in the layers of 0.00–0.05, 0.05–0.10, 0.10–0.20, and 0.20–0.40 m, where physical soil attributes were evaluated (total porosity, microporosity, and microporosity, density, mean diameter of aggregates) as well as chemical attributes (macro-and micronutrients), in addition to carbon and nitrogen storage. To interpret the data, Tukey’s test was applied to compare means, and principal component analysis was used to better characterize the study environments. The results showed that agroforestry and silvopastoral systems developed for large-scale production are efficient in improving chemical and physical attributes that reflect on soil quality, especially in the superficial layers of the soil, overcoming pasture and the natural regeneration process. Carbon and nitrogen storage were the main variables that differentiated the production systems, highlighting the importance of the AGF and SILVP systems as more sustainable agricultural intensification strategies, even in soils of low agricultural suitability. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Legal regulation related to restoration monitoring should be supported and validated by studies that evaluate the performance of indicators. In Brazil, a specific state regulation uses three indicators to attest recovery: ground cover with native vegetation (i.e. canopy cover, for tropical forest restoration projects) and density and richness of native plants spontaneously regenerating. Thus, we adopted other three ecological parameters: richness of zoochorous regenerant species (a functioning indicator linked to seed dispersal), the density of non-pioneer regenerants (a composition indicator), and dominance (a structure indicator), to test whether the indicators of the legal state monitoring protocol were associated to these more qualified indicators and we discussed the state protocol effectiveness. We evaluated 10 sites under restoration in the Atlantic Forest ranging from 9 to 45 years old and a reference area. Our results showed that the three indicators of the state monitoring protocol were associated to more qualified indicators in different restored sites and they can be considered proxies of ecological parameters to monitor and attest restoration success of tropical rainforest. In addition, dominance was strongly associated with richness of regenerants, but it was not associated to density, implying that richness and density of regenerants are not redundant and both should be monitored in the field. This kind of analysis could be usefully applied to define powerful and integrative indicators elsewhere, simplifying them without losing effectiveness as a means to stimulate wide adoption of monitoring protocols in the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration. © 2021 Society for Ecological Restoration.

AB  - The Amazon has one of the largest bauxite reserves in the world and the growing demand for this ore intensifies environmental impacts and, consequently, the necessity of ecosystems restoration. In this sense, the monitoring of indicators is essential to ensure the restoration success. The objective of this study was to evaluate indicators of ecosystem restoration in areas degraded by bauxite mining in the eastern Amazon, Brazil, under three different restoration methods: Nucleation (NC), Seedling planting (SP), and induction of natural regeneration (NR) in comparison with a reference forest (RF). Structural and compositional indicators, including density, frequency, and dominance, as well as the Importance Value Index (IVI) of tree species, mortality, conservation status, diversity indices, and Mean Annual Increase in height and diameter (MAIH and MAIDBH) were assessed. Solanum crinitum, Cecropia distachya, Senegalia polyphylla, and Qualea grandiflora were the most important species according to IVI for SP, NR, NC, and RF, respectively. In SP, MAIH and MAIDBH were higher than in the other treatments, however, the difference between methods was not of significant. The diversity indices of the three restoration methods tested were close to those of RF. Four species with some conservation status were identified; Cedrela odorata, Genipa americana, Swietenia macrophylla, and Hymenaea parvifolia, all native to the eastern Amazon. Thus, through the indicators, we found that all restoration methods showed positive indicators of restoration and a gradual return of the structural characteristics of the vegetation. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Amazonia is well known for its high natural regeneration capacity; for this reason, passive restoration is normally recommended for the recovery of its degraded forests. However, highly deforested landscapes in southern Amazonia require active restoration. Since restoration methods can shape the quality and speed of early forest recovery, this study aimed to verify how active restoration pushes sites stably covered with exotic grasses towards forest recovery. We evaluated early forest succession at active restoration sites, i.e., soil plowing, direct seeding of pioneer species, and seedling stock planting at low density. We analyzed forest structure, diversity, and species composition in two age classes, 0.5–3.5 and 4.5–7.5 years old. As reference, we evaluated sites able to naturally regenerate in the same region. We sampled 36 active restoration and 31 natural regeneration sites along the Madeira River, southern Amazonia. Active restoration triggered succession to similar or higher levels of forest structure than sites where natural regeneration was taking place. The most dominant species did not overlap between active restoration and natural regeneration sites. The overall composition of species was different between the two restoration methods. Dominant species and size class distribution show that active restoration is performing successfully. Soil preparation combined with a high availability of seeds of pioneer trees resulted in a high stem density and basal area of facilitative pioneer trees. Planted seedlings added species diversity and increased density of large trees. Interventions to increase the odds of natural regeneration can be effective for non-regenerating sites in resilient landscapes. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - The objective of this article was to analyze the benefits of Agroforestry Systems (AFSs) association with natural regeneration promoted by family farmers of Tomé-Açu, Pará, Brazil. Based on 46 previous interviews with family farmers, 12 of them were selected due to the presence of AFSs with different levels of tree species diversity, in which richness and diversity of tree species were taken into account. In addition, the measurement of the floristic variables was carried out. Results showed that 17% of the AFSs have natural regeneration corridors. This type of AFS has high species richness and diversity (Shannon-Weaner = 2.5), and its main characteristic is the presence of regeneration corridors of secondary forests. Therefore, farmers make production and forest regeneration compatible, and: a) maintain in their AFSs environmental services provided by regenerated secondary forests, b) ensure food security for their families, and c) they may have financial incomes from selling AFS products. © 2022 Universidade de Brasilia.

AB  - Several studies indicate that the Amazon rainforest is home to the greatest biodiversity of tree species on the planet. The unique quality of this forest typology is under constant threat of change owing to the behavior of climate variables and different anthropic activities that occur in the biome itself. Therefore, it is essential to conduct studies that clarify the factors that affect the formation of forests in this ecosystem and to validate the use of forest resources by society through appropriate forest management practices. Thus, this study aimed to answer how the structure, composition and floristic diversity of the forest are influenced by forest logging in different phases of development of a local Amazonian forest, and whether there is a relationship between these attributes and regional and global climate factors. This study assessed the dynamics of natural regeneration of 36 permanent plots over 33 years after logging in the Tapajós National Forest in Belterra, State of Pará, Brazil. The plots studied were measured in 1981, 1983, 1985, 1987, 1992, 1997, 2007, and 2012. All individuals with height greater than 30 cm and diameter at breast height <10 cm were monitored in three regeneration strata (seedlings, saplings, and small trees) and three forest classes (gap-phase forest, growing forest, and old-growth forest). Density, floristic similarity according to the Sørensen Index, and floristic diversity according to the Hill series were analyzed. Climate variables such as mean annual compensated temperature; total annual precipitation, and Oceanic Niño Index were correlated with the mortality, recruitment, and density of growing trees. An ANOVA for count data verified that the density of individuals differed over time since logging among the regeneration strata and forest classes analyzed. Likewise, the diversity profiles generated from the Hill series were significantly different from each other, and the floristic similarity varied between regeneration strata over time. For the forest classes, the similarity values ranged between 50% and 96%. The gap-phase forest areas had the lowest similarity values, with some 100% dissimilar surveys. However, there was an exponential reduction in similarity over time in the different forest classes. The results indicate that logging promotes significant changes in floristic structure and diversity in different strata of natural regeneration and forest classes over time. Additionally, no correlation was found between climate variables and the natural regeneration dynamics in the Tapajós National Forest. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The Brazilian semiarid region has been subjected to strong man-made actions since the 1970s, which have resulted in landscape transformation. The scientific literature presents several studies on the soil properties or microclimate of different types of landscapes; however, less attention was having been paid to the surface contrast between native vegetation and bare soil. The objective of this research was to evaluate the soil properties and microclimate of two common landscapes in the Brazilian semiarid region, a seasonally dry tropical forest (Caatinga) and a deforested area. Soil and microclimate data were obtained from two sites, both located in the State of Pernambuco, Brazil. Soil samples were collected on six dates and from layers, and microclimate variables were measured for three years. Soil properties and microclimatic data were evaluated using the Mann-Whitney test, as well as regression and principal component analysis. Successive years of agricultural practices affected the bulk density, promoting an increase in the total porosity of the soil in the deforested area site. In addition, changes were verified in the magnitude of many chemical properties (pH, P, K+, Mg2+, Cu2+, Fe, Mn, Zn2+ and Ca2+), indicating soil degradation. Compared with the Caatinga forest site, the minimum air temperature was 2.3 °C, and the maximum vapor pressure deficit was 7% higher in the deforested area site, and it is very likely that Caatinga removal there will lead to a reduction in precipitation. The results suggest that Caatinga vegetation removal followed by agricultural practices and subsequent land abandonment promotes significant changes in soil properties and the microclimate, which can contribute to advances in desertification and affects agricultural activities in the Brazilian semiarid region. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This study aimed to evaluate the biomass and chemical composition of the forest floor litter in three remnants of Submontane Dense Ombrophilous Forest located in the Guaricica Natural Reserve in the municipality of Antonina, state of Paraná, Brazil. The areas selected for this study are at different stages of secondary succession, here named initial stage (INI), intermediate stage (INT), and advanced stage (ADV). The litter was collected in different seasons of the year (summer and winter of 2013 and 2014) and sorted into fractions: whole leaves (WL), leaves under some stage of decomposition (DL), miscellaneous litter (ML), and branches (B). After sorting, the litter was oven-dried, weighed, and had the contents of C, N, P, K, Ca, and Mg measured. After that, the accumulated amount of each nutrient in the different litter fractions was estimated. Accumulation of biomass in the INI was lower than that in the ADV. The DL fraction showed the highest level of biomass accumulation among all fractions. The average concentration of macronutrients in the litter showed the following sequence: C>N>Ca>Mg>K>P. The C/N ratio was higher in the INI and INT compared with that in the ADV. Higher levels of macronutrients were frequently observed in the ADV. Inputs of C and of most nutrients increased from the INI to the ADV, except for Ca, whose input varied little throughout the different successional stages © 2023, Floresta. All rights reserved

AB  - Although its economic importance, bauxite mining causes the loss of natural ecosystems. In this sense, the Technosols building from materials made or modified by man, such as mine tailings, is necessary for recovering degraded areas. Additionally, the Technosols management, such as subsoiling and liming, increases chances of plants establishment and growth. In this study, a degraded area by bauxite mining with constructed Technosol in the Eastern Amazon, Brazil, was tested under three different soil management treatments: Technosol-1 (Tech-1), Liming only; Technosol-2 (Tech-2), Subsoiling + 200 g of NPK in the pit; Technosol-3 (Tech-3), Scarification + liming + all Tech-2 procedures. In every treatment and in a reference forest (R-forest), 8 years after the initial seedling planting, three types of indicators were assessed: structural (horizontal vegetation structure, density of natural regeneration, and soil cover), compositional (species diversity, ecological groups, and dispersal syndromes), and functional (chemical properties of Technosols and dry matter and nutrients from the litter stock). The most representative species in all treatments were Croton matourensis and Vismia guianensis, both coming from the natural regeneration and common in early successional stages. Coverage rates in all treatments showed less than 5% of exposed Technosol and the diversity, ecological group, and dispersal syndrome indexes followed a successful trajectory along 8 years. Tech-2 and Tech-3 presented the best chemical attributes and nutrients in the litter stock, but they would probably last several decades to reach the R-forest attributes. Thus, subsoiling alone or with liming provided the best chemical results for soil, litter, and vegetation performance, being recommended to speed up restoration of degrades areas by bauxite mining in the Amazon. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. part of Springer Nature.

AB  - An increasing number of rivers is being dammed, particularly in the tropics, and reservoir water surfaces can be a substantial anthropogenic source of greenhouse gases. On average, 80% of the CO2-equivalent emission of reservoirs globally has been attributed to CH4, which is predominantly emitted via ebullition. Since ebullition is highly variable across space and time, both measuring and upscaling to an entire reservoir is challenging, and estimates of reservoir CH4 emission are therefore not well constrained. We measured CH4 ebullition at high spatial resolution with an echosounder and bubble traps in two reservoirs of different use (water storage and hydropower), size and productivity in the tropical Brazilian Atlantic Rainforest biome. Based on the spatially most well-resolved whole-reservoir ebullition measurements in the tropics so far, we found that mean CH4 ebullition was twice as high in river inflow areas as in other parts of the reservoirs, and more than 4 times higher in the eutrophic compared to the oligotrophic reservoir. Using different upscaling approaches rendered similar whole-reservoir CH4 ebullition estimates, suggesting that highly spatially-resolved measurements may be more important for constraining reservoir-wide CH4 estimates than choice of upscaling approach. The minimum sampling effort was high (>250 and >1,700 thirty-meter segments of hydroacoustic survey to reach within 50% or 80% accuracy, respectively). This suggests that traditional manual bubble-trap measurements should be abandoned in favor of highly resolved measurements in order to get spatially representative estimates of CH4 ebullition, which accounted for 60% and 99% of total C emission in the two studied reservoirs. © 2021.

AB  - This study aimed to understand post-agricultural natural forest regeneration in the Southern Brazilian Atlantic Forest and its possible role as a cost-effective, passive approach to forest restoration. The study characterized vegetation structure, floristic composition, and the dynamics of secondary forest chronosequences. Data were collected from 159 plots (10 × 10 m each) across forest remnants in Santa Catarina State, covering forest ages that ranged from 2 to 60 years of regeneration after swidden agriculture. Only areas with no signs of degradation were sampled in order to provide a description of vegetation characteristics that could be used to identify and monitor natural regeneration. A total of 11,455 woody plants were identified and classified into 334 species representing 71 families. As the succession process unfolds, the continuous turnover of species makes forests more diverse and structurally complex. Floristic similarity among forest types is observed during the early stages of succession, but decreases over time. Pioneer species dominate young secondary forests, representing about 40% of the basal area up to 10 years of regeneration. Shade-tolerant species start colonizing the sites at early ages; however, they become more important structural elements only after 30 years of succession. The observed patterns of forest structure and species diversity largely conform to the post-agricultural succession seen in many tropical forests. The high species diversity found in this study highlights the importance of natural regeneration as a strategy to restore ecosystems. Floristic data can be used as a reference for choosing suitable species for active restoration, as well as contributing to the design of integrated restoration strategies. We herein reinforce the potential of natural regeneration as part of large-scale restoration programs, which would be particularly attractive to family farmers by the low cost of supplies and labor. © Copyright © 2021 Siminski, Zambiazi, dos Santos and Fantini.

AB  - The vegetative growth of forest canopies changes their spectral response, which can be detected by multispectral sensors and enhanced by utilizing the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). The structural variability of canopies in heterogeneous forests can also be related to successional stages. Thereby, a spatiotemporal methodology is presented to associate the 3D photogrammetric information, derived from aerial images, with the NDVI time series extracted from the Landsat imagery, using spatial units connected to ecological succession. The technique is based on time series clustering within superpixels (extracted from the local variance of tree heights) and on trend analysis of the canopy using the breaks for additive season and trend (BFAST) algorithm. The study was conducted in a tropical native forest remnant (Inland Atlantic Forest) in the western region of São Paulo State, Brazil. We investigated the relationship between the variability of the forest vertical structure and the NDVI temporal trajectory associated with vegetation vigor in the period from 1984 to 2010. The experiments produced a regularized time series of overlaid superpixels. The cluster statistical analysis was successful in separating the NDVI trajectory into ten classes associated to successional stages, in which the evolution of the vegetation vigor could be observed and compared within degraded, transitional, and preserved areas. Such areas overlapping with the ten trajectory classes allowed us to quantify that 59.9% of the clusters were related to preserved areas, 30.1% to transitional areas, and 10.0% to degraded areas. Additionally, the BFAST algorithm allowed the identification of trend measures and the occurrence of disturbance events within these trajectory classes based on the vegetation response. Therefore, the classification of NDVI trajectory clusters helps to understand how the areas in a heterogeneous forest with different succession stages develop spectrally. Furthermore, monitoring secondary forests is essential for the conservation of biodiversity, ecosystem functioning, and carbon stock, among other values. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Planting tree monocultures in Brazilian savannas is a common practice for wood production. However, afforestation and fire suppression have caused significant ecological changes and biodiversity loss in the Cerrado region. Restoring these modified systems to their pre-plantation states remains a considerable challenge. In this study, we compared the recovery of savanna vegetation after afforestation in areas managed with three restoration strategies: (i) old pine plantation stands that are not managed anymore (control), (ii) passive restoration (natural regeneration after pine clearcutting), and (iii) native tree planting (native tree seedlings planted at high density after pine clearcutting). To compare the outcome of each strategy to native ecosystems that were never plantations, we sampled a cerrado sensu stricto (the desired restoration target), and a cerradão (the local alternative state when savannas are fire-suppressed). Fifteen years after applying the restoration approaches, we assessed the structure, richness, and composition of the plant communities. For the analyses, we separated the upper layer (woody native species, diameter at breast height (DBH) ≥ 5 cm) and ground layer (woody species with height ≥ 50 cm and DBH < 5 cm, and subshrubs and herbs), and distinguished savanna species from forest and generalist species. The results showed that both passive restoration and native tree planting restored the structure, richness, and composition of the upper layer, reaching the values of the cerrado sensu stricto. In contrast, in all treatments, the ground layer lacked the subshrubs and herbs typical of undisturbed savannas, with communities appearing similar to cerradão. Generalist species dominated all layers, and tree canopy cover in the treatments (mean values from 64.7% to 83.0%) ranged from 2.4 to 3 times the cover value recorded in the cerrado sensu stricto (mean of 28%). Pine clearcutting, independent of whether it was followed by native tree planting, improved the recovery of savanna woody vegetation. Therefore, we suggest that pine clearcutting, but not tree planting, is necessary to restore the woody community. Despite these apparently positive restoration outcomes for the woody plant community, it is important to note that after 15 years of passive restoration, communities are turning into low-diversity forests composed of generalist species and lacking savanna species in the ground-layer community. We therefore suggest that restoration of cerrado sensu stricto after pine clearcutting will require controlling woody encroachment, via prescribed fire or mechanical tree thinning, and planting of savanna subshrubs and herbs, rather than trees. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - As forests in neotropical regions, particularly in developing countries, are devastated, interventions to restore biodiversity and its ecological functions are needed. Rural producers have thus been encouraged to grow trees for wood production as an economic activity. The objective of this study was to quantify the increment of wood density of four forest species from different successional classes of a mixed system of restoration in a neotropical forest in Brazil. Tree discs were sampled at breast height and analyzed radially by X-ray densitometry to obtain apparent density and basic density. Three trees each of a species from the pioneer, early and late secondary successional stages and of the dominant species in the climax community. The radial profiles indicated increasing density from the pith to bark of trunks, except for some variations due to wood defects and growth. Average density was 0.576 g cm−3, 0.655 g cm−3, 0.706 g cm−3 and 0.775 g cm−3, respectively, for Peltophorum dubium, Schinus terebinthifolius, Cariniana estrellensis and Hymenaea courbaril. Radial profiles indicated higher amplitudes in the apparent densities for slow-growing species. X-ray densitometry generated parameters such as minimum, average and maximum densities, and radial density variations. These parameters are important for understanding the ecological functional role of successional classes of the Atlantic Forest from the Neotropical region. © 2021, Northeast Forestry University.

AB  - The Madeira River Settlement at Rondônia state is one of the various Federal projects in the Legal Amazon created by the National Institute for Colonization and Agrarian Reform (INCRA). Over the years, fire practices such as slash-and-burn agriculture in the Legal Amazon have been converting the remained forest into pastures and croplands. According to the Brazilian New Forest Code, the rural environmental registry (CAR) became mandatory for monitoring the land occupations, aiming at maintaining forests and legal reserves preserved. The study goal was to analyze socioenvironmental aspects of the land-use and land-cover (LULC) dynamic at Madeira River settlement and its surroundings before and after the registry implementation, between July 2008 and July 2018. Thematic classes and altimetry were overlaid using algebraic operators to create a zoning model with 21 zoning classes. The highest reduction in forested areas was observed in zone six, between SRTM heights of 90 and 100 m, with a forest loss of 1684 ha and forest gain of 638 ha. Transition map results showed the most forest conversion into secondary vegetation of 57.29 km2 in ten years (2008–2018). The occupation increased at zones 11 and 12, showing the movement of settlers into the rainforest, with higher altimetry. The remained settlement lots located at low altimetry in the permanent protection area (PPA) are subject to the risk of flooding. The results also showed that the correlation between lot size and deforestation was not significant, suggesting that a set of social and environmental driver variables may be responsible for both losses and gains in the vegetated area in each lot. Family farming needs assistance for sustainable food production and to avoid soil degradation and abandonment, with an integrated effort of institutions, government and society. The manuscript serves as a regional case study that provides a relevant issue related to public policies concerning Legal Amazonian settlements occupation and deforestation, which may support the monitoring and controlling actions in the region. © 2022

AB  - The BDq method is a forest management technique that conducts natural regeneration and establishes criteria for removing trees from the forest by estimating the lowest impact on the remaining population. Current study evaluates the potential for sustainable forest management of Commiphora leptophloeos (Mart.) J.B. Gillett by simulations in a remnant seasonally dry forest in Salinas, northern section of the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil. Thirty plots, 10 m x 10 m, were selected for data collection. All trees with D2 ≥ 3.18 cm were sampled. The BDq selection method was employed: remaining basal area (B), maximum diameter (D) and De Liocourt constant (q). So that the method may be applied, six management alternatives were proposed with remaining basal area rates of 50 and 75% combined with 'q' rates of 1.3; 1, 5; and 1.7. Commiphora leptophloeos was the species with the greatest number of individuals.ha-1with aggregate distribution in the forest inventory in the area. Diametric distribution complied with inverted 'J'. On the other hand, the volume ratio was inversely proportional, where the classes with the highest numbers of individuals did not represent the highest volume. The total volume of the species in the area was 37.50 m3.ha-1. The prescribed cutoff estimate was 20.32 m3.ha-1and 13.16 m3.ha-1for a 'q' of 1.5 and remaining basal area of 50 and 75% respectively. Management strategies proposed for C. leptophloeos were viable according to the structure of the remaining population. © 2021 University Center of Maringa. All rights reserved.

AB  - Context: Despite the importance of secondary forests for the maintenance of biodiversity, the impact of pioneer trees on habitat loss and fragmentation is poorly understood. Objectives: We analyzed the effects of landscape structure on genetic variability (node level analyses) and genetic differentiation (link level analyses) of the pioneer tree Cecropia hololeuca in the Atlantic Forest of southeastern Brazil. At the node level, we analyzed the effects of landscape structure (forest and pasture amount, compositional heterogeneity, number and shape of patches, and matrix dominance), topography (slope and elevation), and effective population size (Ne) on allelic richness (AR), genetic diversity (He) and inbreeding coefficient (f). At the link level, we analyzed the effect of four resistance surfaces (isolation by geographic distance, land cover, elevation, and slope) on genetic differentiation between populations (FST, G’ST, Jost’s D). Methods: We genotyped 257 individuals of C. hololeuca using eight microsatellite loci. At the node level, we calculated landscape and topographic variables at six spatial scales. At the link level, we optimized the resistance surfaces using ResistanceGA. We used a model selection approach to select the most parsimonious models. Results: At the node level, matrices dominated by pastures had higher AR than landscapes dominated by Eucalyptus at the 1500 m spatial scale. At the link level, FST was best explained by slope, with lower values imposing more resistance. All resistance surfaces explained G’ST. Conclusions: In addition to conserving and restoring habitats, management practices that improve matrix permeability should be adopted to favor the movement of dispersers, consequently improving natural regeneration, increasing allelic richness, and decreasing genetic differentiation of natural populations. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - Environmental changes caused by edge effects and matrix land use can inter-fere with plant community resilience and, consequently, alter forest succes-sion. Here, we aimed to (i) investigate whether species composition, density and richness in a forest’s regeneration layer vary in its edge-to-interior gradi-ent and (ii) analyze the relationship between regeneration and local abiotic variables. We conducted the study in the lowland rainforest of the Atlantic Forest biodiversity hotspot at the Córrego Grande Biological Reserve, Espírito Santo state, Brazil. We sampled the regeneration layer in two edge environments with different matrices (forest and road) and the fragmented interior to link vegetation structure with environmental variables. In each environment, we set up 12 plots of 5 × 10 m size and recorded, in each plot, the height and stem base diameter of all living individuals above 50 cm of height and below 2.5 cm of diameter at breast height (1.30 m height). We applied different multivariate analyses to assess the influence of environmental data, such as canopy openness and physical-chemical soil variables. The three environments shared 22 out of the 174 morphospecies recorded, and the forest-side edge had the lowest species richness among all environments. The environmental variables that better explained the distribution of species across the three environments were: canopy openness, soil penetration resistance, zinc, and cal-cium content. Our results revealed significant environmental differences among the forest edges and the forest interior of the study site, highlighting the relevant role of the forest surrounding matrix for the maintenance of pro-tected remnants. © 2022, SISEF - Italian Society of Silviculture and Forest Ecology.

AB  - The indigenous systems of agricultural and forest management in the Amazon are characterized by a deep knowledge of ecological processes, biodiversity, and the use and management of fire. The influence of these systems on the distribution of biodiversity includes semi-domesticated and domesticated species and landscapes, which have led to extensive anthropogenic or cultural forests. However, in many places, the livelihoods of indigenous peoples are being transformed by the intensification of agriculture and social, ecological, and economic changes, putting at risk the sustainability of production systems and food security and sovereignty of these peoples. In the last years, in the Xingu Indigenous Territory (XIT), the food production systems and the form of occupation of territories have changed, affecting the recovery of secondary forests, which now demand a too long period. The increase in the number and frequency of fires has aggravated this situation, due to a drier climate that has become predominant in the region. Changes in climate are attributed to deforestation in the neighboring municipalities, especially in the headwaters of the Xingu river basin. This study was conducted among the Kawaiwete (Tupi-Guarani) and the Ikpeng (Carib-Arara) peoples in the XIT, in the state of Mato Grosso, Brazil. The main objective was to develop alternative techniques of forest management based on indigenous and scientific knowledge more adapted to the new livelihood contexts, aiming to favor forest regeneration in areas dominated by shifting cultivation. We sought to answer the following questions: (I) How do forests regenerate during the fallow period? (II) How can local management improve forest regeneration? (III) Are there indicator species for secondary succession, soil recovery, and vulnerability to fires? (IV) Is the increase in the number of fires affecting the sustainability of the shifting cultivation systems? Our results show that some local practices based on indigenous knowledge have the potential to facilitate natural regeneration, such as choosing forest areas that have been recovered for agricultural use, limiting the number of cultivation cycles, protecting and selecting of individual trees during cultivation period, and attracting seed dispersers. Assisted natural regeneration strategies grounded on indigenous knowledge are promising ways to restore degraded lands of the XIT. © Copyright © 2021 Schmidt, Ikpeng, Kayabi, Sanches, Ono and Adams.

AB  - The most severe global warming is predicted to occur in the Amazon region of Brazil, with an estimated temperature increase of 4 to 8 °C between 2071 and 2100. Our study evaluated the effects of increased temperatures on germination success of seeds in the soil seed bank of secondary forests in Central Amazonia. Soil samples (3-cm depth) were collected in six secondary forests with different land-use histories and ages of regrowth. Soils from all sites were sieved and mixed, and germination and seedling development were assessed during 4 months of incubation in germination chambers at (1) a constant temperature of 25 °C and a 12:12 h alternating temperature regime of 20:30 °C, considered as controls; (2) a simulated 5 °C temperature increase to 30 °C and 25:35 °C and (3) a 10 °C temperature increase to 35 °C and 30:40 °C. To determine the effect of light vs. dark on germination, germination was compared for samples in light (12 h daily photoperiod) vs. continuously dark for 1 month, followed by 3 months in light. Six temperature conditions were tested with 30 subsamples each. In the mixed soil seed bank, 3640 seeds germinated, of which 18 families, 28 genera and 41 species (grouped in 20 trees, 11 shrubs, eight herbs and two lianas) could be identified. A light requirement for germination was detected for 94–97% of the species. Alternating temperatures did not stimulate germination in the dark. Seedling density m−2 was 1.7 to 2.3 times higher at alternating (20:30 °C and 25:35 °C) than at constant temperatures (25 °C and 30 °C); but an increase of 10 °C decreased seedling density to 47% at 35 °C and 26% at 30:40 °C compared to control (100% at 25 °C and 20:30 °C); and furthermore increased seedling mortality. Thus, the secondary forest at the study area may maintain its integrity with a 5 °C but not with a 10 °C temperature increase. Species-specific sensitivities to temperature were detected. Temperature may function to fine-tune germination at a specific microsite, and the variety of germination requirements may enhance coexistence and maintenance of species diversity within the pioneer species subset. In general, seeds of tree species were more sensitive to increased temperatures than those of shrubs and herbs, supporting the hypothesis of replacement of the tropical forest by savanna-like vegetation in the Amazon region. Our results show that natural regeneration may be significantly affected by global warming and with potential to alter floristic composition. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Shrubs of the Psychotria L. (Rubiaceae) genus can occur like a dominant species in the understory of subtropical forests. This study aims to understand the ecological conditions of Psychotria dominance, specifically Psychotria leiocarpa Cham. & Schltdl. and Psychotria carthagenensis Jacq. in the understory, and its relation with natural tree regeneration. We sampled 162 plots of 1 m2 in an ecotonal Semi-deciduous Seasonal Forest remnant (243.28 ha) in the Pampa biome, in Southern Brazil. The analysis considered three habitat-selective regimes which occur in the remnant (road-edge, eucalyptus-edge, and forest-interior), and environmental variables (air temperature, relative humidity, canopy opening, inclination, solar exposition, altitude, and ground cover), according to which relationships between Psychotria and regenerating trees could be established in a different way. We assumed the hypothesis that the dominance of Psychotria shrubs in the understory may influence the natural regenerating trees and differ in relation to habitat-selective regimes and in function of environmental variables. No evidence of effective ecological dominance was found. The results indicated regular regeneration density for regenerating trees and for Psychotria shrubs. P. leiocarpa was predominant in the regeneration community, followed by regenerating trees and P. carthagenensis. In addition, P. carthagenensis demonstrated an aggregated behavior, forming few groups with high density. The environmental variables influenced the composition and/or abundance of the regeneration community and were more intense than the habitat-selective regimes. The habitat-selective regimes mostly acted in P. leiocarpa, which presented less density at the road-edge. Our results demonstrate that Psychotria shrub densities do not decrease the natural regeneration of trees, thus suggesting that P. leiocarpa and P. carthagenensis are multifunctional species which act in the understory as filters which favor ecological succession, even in different habitat-selective regimes. Therefore, they can be a key tool for ecological restoration and conservation, acting as core species in strategies to promote succession processes and ecological enrichment. © 2021

AB  - Aim of study: We checked if an infrastructure investment project for a nursery to produce Eucalyptus forest seedlings using the real options approach was economically viable, in order to verify the influence of the deferral, expansion and abandonment options on the investment project value, as well as their concatenation. Area of study: Our study was based on technical-economic coefficients of a nursery infrastructure to be installed in the São Paulo’s state Midwest region, Brazil. Materials and methods: The investment was assessed by addressing the uncertainties inherent in the investment pro-ject. We used the dynamic model for real option approach and, to determine the volatility of the project, we applied the Monte Carlo simulation method. As real options for the project, we employed deferral, expansion, and abandonment. Main results: Using the traditional valuation methodology, we obtained a negative static net present value of USD 50,957. When incorporating the real options of the abandonment, deferral and expansion in the form of managerial flexibility to forest managers, we obtained the expanded net present value of USD 216,498, that is, 524.8% of valuation. The traditional method of investment evaluation undervalues the project in infrastructures to produce Eucalyptus forest seedlings nursery, and the increase in managerial flexibility, through the real options for deferral, expansion and aban-donment, promotes value to forest managers and enables the feasibility of the project. Research highlights: Infrastructure investment project for a nursery to produce Eucalyptus forest seedlings is not economically viable through the traditional economic evaluation techniques. However, by incorporating managerial flexibilities, through real options, the investment project was valued and it became economically viable. © 2022 CSIC.

AB  - In natural regeneration, vegetation goes through different stages over time, each of them with different conditions to drain the precipitated water to the soil surface. The aim of this study was to evaluate interception loss, throughfall, stemflow and surface runoff in early and advanced stages regeneration at evergreen rainforest subtype sites within the Atlantic Forest, located in the Serra do Itajaí National Park, in southern Brazil. Rainfall was sampled by three rain gauges and throughfall was measured using “U” type gutters. The stemflow was measured in 24 trees per stage (i.e., 48 trees in total). The interception loss was calculated as the difference between rainfall and the sum of the throughfall plus stemflow. The surface runoff was evaluated using metal rails. Vegetation in the initial stage is a composition of 7 species with a basal area of 5.01 m².ha-1 and advanced stage site consists of 28 species with a basal area of 34.7 m².ha-1 . Throughfall records were 81.7% in the initial and 74.1% in the advanced regeneration stages. The stemflows registered were 5.93% in the initial stage and 0.54% in the advanced stage while the interception losses were respectively 13.2% and 25.8%. Surface runoffs observations were 11.1% in the initial stage and 10.7% in the advanced stage. Statistically significant differences were found between the regeneration stages for the stemflow and for the interception loss parameters. The study showed that, for some hydrological processes, the behavior of the precipitated water differs for the stage of vegetation regeneration. The regeneration stage does not influence the surface runoff, demonstrating that after a few years of vegetation regeneration, this hydrological process is equivalent to vegetation in an advanced stage. © 2022, Universidade Federal de Santa Maria.

AB  - The installation of shrimp and salt ponds has contributed to the devastation of several mangroves worldwide. In semiarid regions, where few mangroves are able to cope with the harsh environment, these forests are more vulnerable to human impacts. In Brazil, several aquaculture and salt ponds have been established over mangroves and salt flats (‘apicuns’) i.e. sandier natural areas contiguous to mangroves. These areas, often hypersaline, can be colonized by mangroves if tidal coverage increases, and should, therefore, be protected to ensure mangrove conservation against predicted sea level rise. To restore a mangrove stand in an abandoned saltworks (former ‘apicum’ area) in northeast Brazil, hydrological restoration measures were applied, which involved digging channels to restore estuarine water flux to planted and water-borne propagules. In two years, mangroves developed rapidly in the intervention area, after decades of slow monospecific Avicennia germinans recovery. Survival of planted Rhizophora mangle propagules was high, and naturally established Avicennia germinans and Laguncularia racemosa reached far higher densities and heights in channels with respect to the condition before channeling. These results provide valuated insight into mangrove expansion over salt flats by increasing tidal coverage from ongoing rising sea levels. Associated with ecological changes after mangrove rehabilitation and driven by the return of plant and faunal key groups, ecological interactions like facilitation, herbivory and bioturbation increased in the restored area. Our results shed light on the processes related to forest recovery of degraded littoral areas, and contribute to improving the restoration and management of mangrove forests in semiarid coasts. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Society of Wetland Scientists.

AB  - Birds are important hosts for various tick species, playing a significant role in their biological life cycle and dispersion. In this study, we investigated tick infestations on birds trapped in an urban remnant of Atlantic Forest in Pernambuco state, Brazil. From February 2015 to March 2017, 541 birds belonging to 52 species were trapped with mist nets and examined for ectoparasites. Birds trapped in the late successional forest were significantly more infested than birds trapped in the early successional forest. In the same way, ectoparasite infestation varied significantly according to bird weight and collection plot. Overall, 198 birds (36.6%) belonging to 27 species were parasitized by ectoparasites (i.e., ticks, lice and/or mites). Ectoparasites were effectively collected from 111 birds, of which 99 belonging to 20 species were infested by ticks (n = 261), namely, Amblyomma longirostre (13 nymphs), Amblyomma nodosum (21 nymphs), Amblyomma varium (one nymph), and Amblyomma spp. (five nymphs and 221 larvae). Most of the ticks (> 90%) were collected from Passeriformes. This study provides the second record of A. varium in Pernambuco state and confirms that birds, especially Passeriformes, are important hosts for larvae and nymphs of Amblyomma spp. in the Atlantic Forest biome of Pernambuco. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Current restoration monitoring protocols have been developed for active restoration projects (based on planting seedlings) and little is known about their applicability in assessing vegetation resulting from passive restoration, an important knowledge gap for the restoration of tropical and subtropical forests. The present study was developed in a 12-year-old subtropical riparian forest undergoing passive restoration (based on spontaneous natural regeneration), and aimed to evaluate the regenerating vegetation using two monitoring protocols developed for active ecological restoration. The following indicators of restoration success were evaluated: canopy cover; basal area; above-ground biomass; total richness; richness and density of regenerating trees. Passive restoration strategy has been found to be successful in the study area as the observed values for the indicators (except basal area and biomass) were above reference values specified for a 12-year-old active restoration. Our results also show that for most of the indicators of restoration success, the reference values established for the evaluation of active restoration projects may be surpassed through unassisted natural regeneration, suggesting the feasibility of the application of these monitoring protocols for the evaluation of passive restoration projects. © 2020, International Society for Tropical Ecology.

AB  - In the Eastern Amazon, abandoned and unproductive areas are widespread and normally found as a result of soil degradation. In this study we presented the following scientific question: Is it possible to improve the quality of soil physical and biological attributes of areas previously occupied by abandoned pastures with commercial plantation of the native species Dipteryx odorata? To respond this question, the objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of D. odorata plantations after abandoned pastures on the soil physical and biological attributes, using the soil from a successional forest in the municipality of Óbidos, Eastern Amazon, Brazil, as a reference. Disturbed and undisturbed soil samples were collected from depths 0–10, 10–20, and 20–40 cm to determine organic matter content, bulk density, macro-, micro-, and total porosity. Soil macrofauna was collected at depth 0–10 cm and visual evaluation of soil structure was also conducted. The plantation accumulated organic matter and presented higher density of the macrofauna orders Haplotaxida and Blattodea, suborder Isoptera, and promoted better soil structural quality. Results were similar to those of the reference forest and higher than those of abandoned pastures. The D. odorata plantation was therefore an effective alternative for forest recovery of degraded areas in the region. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Primate thanatology, or the study of primate responses to dying and death, has become increasingly relevant in recent years. However, the number of reports remains small and the quality of published records is highly variable. Here, we extend the literature on comparative thanatology with observations on a population of the northern muriqui (Brachyteles hypoxanthus). We compiled all seven cases of muriqui responses to dead, dying, or abandoned infants observed by trained researchers of the Muriqui Project of Caratinga between 1998 and 2020. Four different adult females were observed carrying their dead offspring (n = 4) and one of these females was also observed carrying her dead grand-offspring (n = 1). Five of the seven cases involved dead newborns, one involved a newborn abandoned by its mother on the forest floor, and one involved a 1.6-year-old infant that was visibly ill and died after its mother left it on the ground. Dead newborns were carried for 1–3 days, and all cases occurred during the dry season months. No other age-sex classes were observed to interact with the dead or dying immatures. Our observations are consistent with hypotheses concerning the predominance of dead-infant carrying in other primates, and with the effects of climate on rates of corpse disintegration. They also show the value of long-term studies for obtaining and understanding anecdotal records of rare behavior. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Japan Monkey Centre.

AB  - The present study aimed to evaluate some chemical and physical attributes of the soil, as well as the litter accumulated above ground in two areas at different fallow times after pebble and sand exploration, compared to a secondary forest. The study was carried out in the municipality of Capitao Poco, Para, Brazil. Each study area has about 5 ha. The three areas are composed of a forest fragment (FOR;, a mined area with fallow of 4S months (DA4S) and an area mined in a period of IS months (DAI8). The variables analyzed were soil density, soil particle density, soil fertility and litter physical quality. FOR obtained higher values of litter biomass in almost all factors analyzed. Just the water holding capacity of the litter in tins area together with the weight of the fresh straw. I11 general, it was observed that it is more appropriate to use the fallow observed in the DAIS area for intervention through recovery practices to take advantage of natural regeneration. © 2023 Federal University of Mato Grosso.

AB  - The Brazilian Cerrado is one of the most biodiverse savannas in the world, yet 46% of its original cover has been cleared to make way for crops and pastures. These extensive land-use transitions (LUTs) are expected to influence regional climate by reducing evapotranspiration (ET), increasing land surface temperature (LST), and ultimately reducing precipitation. Here, we quantify the impacts of LUTs on ET and LST in the Cerrado by combining MODIS satellite data with annual land use and land cover maps from 2006 to 2019. We performed regression analyses to quantify the effects of six common LUTs on ET and LST across the entire gradient of Cerrado landscapes. Results indicate that clearing forests for cropland or pasture increased average LST by ~3.5°C and reduced mean annual ET by 44% and 39%, respectively. Transitions from woody savannas to cropland or pasture increased average LST by 1.9°C and reduced mean annual ET by 27% and 21%, respectively. Converting native grasslands to cropland or pasture increased average LST by 0.9 and 0.6°C, respectively. Conversely, grassland-to-pasture transitions increased mean annual ET by 15%. To date, land changes have caused a 10% reduction in water recycled to the atmosphere annually and a 0.9°C increase in average LST across the biome, compared to the historic baseline under native vegetation. Global climate changes from increased atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations will only exacerbate these effects. Considering potential future scenarios, we found that abandoning deforestation control policies or allowing legal deforestation to continue (at least 28.4 Mha) would further reduce yearly ET (by −9% and −3%, respectively) and increase average LST (by +0.7 and +0.3°C, respectively) by 2050. In contrast, policies encouraging zero deforestation and restoration of the 5.2 Mha of illegally deforested areas would partially offset the warming and drying impacts of land-use change. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - The use of suitable ecological indicators for assessing and monitoring passive restoration is essential to understand the dynamics of natural regeneration and the restoration course. However, most developed restoration protocols in Brazil are specifically intended for monitoring active restoration. Only a few studies are addressing ecological indicators for passive restoration. In this context, we tested indicators defined by a monitoring protocol (SMA Resolution 32/2014) formulated for active restoration, along with other indicators of richness, diversity, and functional aspects of natural regeneration. The evaluations took place in sites under passive restoration in different age classes (between three and twelve years old) and in a secondary riparian forest (reference ecosystem) inside the Mixed Ombrophilous Forest (Araucaria Forest) in South Brazil. Those sites had previously been covered and degraded by Pinus taeda L. plantations. We compared the evaluated sites with the intermediate and final reference values proposed by the protocol to define the suitability of the tested indicators and the forest restoration process. Results showed that the canopy cover, density, and richness of regenerants are suitable to evaluate areas under passive restoration with a history of degradation by forestry. However, it is necessary to adapt the protocol's reference values. We further suggest the inclusion of other indicators related to the ecosystem's structure and functionality as the herbaceous cover, dispersion syndrome, life form, and the ecological group of species, as well the definition of indicator species for the different restoration levels. Despite the low similarity in composition, structure, and functional aspects with the reference ecosystem, the passive restoration showed potential to perpetuate the successional course in the studied areas. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The Caatinga, the largest region of seasonally dry tropical forest in the Neotropics, suffers high rates of deforestation and habitat degradation, mostly due to wood extraction. As an alternative to illegal logging, governments have looked at more sustainable management schemes, allowing natural regeneration after logging through relatively long (∼25-year) harvest rotations. We investigated the impacts of forest management at a 1,700-ha privately owned area located at the Araripe Plateau, in the semiarid interior of northeastern Brazil, focusing on the population parameters of 8 avian species. The property was subdivided into 22 forest stands, where a different stand has been logged every year since 2004. By 2016, when we sampled the avifauna, 12 forest stands had already been logged and allowed to regrow, creating a landscape of logged and unlogged stands and a 12-year forest recovery chrono-sequence. We conducted distance-based sampling along transects to estimate the density and abundance of these species in logged and unlogged stands. We found that logging impacted 3 of the target species. Two of them (Megaxenops parnaguae and Synallaxis scutata) were less abundant, whereas another (Sclerurus cearensis) disappeared altogether from logged areas. We also found a positive correlation between the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and the avian density of the affected species. However, we failed to observe any significant relationship between forest recovery or NDVI and species densities, suggesting that even after 12 years of forest recovery, species abundance remains lower in logged than in unlogged areas. We found that logging impacted birds in a species-specific manner, with 5 species unaffected and 3 species declining. Although our sampling occurred half-way through the regeneration cycle, we found no evidence of recovery for those species most affected. We suggest keeping unlogged areas intermingled with logged stands, allowing the survival and potential recovery of species in regenerating forests.  © American Ornithological Society 2021.

AB  - When an ecosystem undergoing restoration does not follow the desired trajectory, management interventions may be warranted. Where the initial steps towards restoration include tree planting at high densities, reduction of stand basal area (BA) by overstory thinning is a potential adaptive management tool to stimulate natural regeneration, although it can also damage young plants. We ask how tree regeneration in a restored tropical forest responds to different intensities of thinning. We applied two intensities of thinning to a 22-yr-old restored forest in southeastern Brazil and then sampled seedlings and saplings before and over an eight year period after thinning; unthinned plots were retained as controls. Thinning impacts on the woody understory were negligible, far below annual mortality in control plots. Positive responses to thinning were stronger in the treatment with low remaining basal area (ca. 30% below the reference forests), with increases in seedling density, numbers of recruits, and seedling-to-sapling and sapling-to-tree transitions. Understory dynamics were clearly intensified by gap opening, with a pulse of natural regeneration in the first years after thinning. These changes, however, were not simultaneous and did not usually persist over time. Rarefied richness of the understory increased over time after all treatments and changes in species composition of saplings were enhanced by thinning. Our study gives support to selective timber harvests from restored tropical forests insofar as thinning did not threaten the understory and stimulated natural regeneration. Frequency and intensity of thinning operations, however, should be locally adjusted based on monitoring data. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The Fundão Dam rupture in Mariana, Brazil spilled contaminated tailings across the Doce River basin reaching several towns such as Ipaba. Ibapa's agricultural and fishing activities declined by 50% due to the toxicity of sodium and ether-amine, followed by a reduction of nitrate resulting in inhibition of plant growth and biota. A settler's community in Ipaba composed of 51 families whose main sources of income were agriculture and fishing activities have abandoned their properties because the land became unproductive after the Fundão dam rupture, and the rural exodus is a current concern in the town. However, previous research has demonstrated that the remediation of sodium and ether-amine, as well as the recovery of soil fertility is feasible, enabling the establishment of the native Atlantic Forest and crop species. Such procedures are recommended to recover the agricultural production in Ipaba. Aiming at protecting these cropping areas against flooding, we propose the creation of riparian forests in the floodplains. In order to make the settlers able to properly manage their lands in a post-disaster scenario, a recovery plan for Ipaba may be implemented via nature based solutions supported by social capital actions such as agroforestry technical training schools and social association, which are shown through schemes and three-dimensional modelling. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Forests provides major ecosystem services worldwide. The Brazilian Atlantic Forest (BAF) has been dramatically devastated, with fragmentation processes jeopardizing its long-term sustainability. This study investigated the structure and successional dynamics in BAF natural regeneration along an anthroposequence characterized by increasing human disturbance histories as: secondary (SF) > disturbed (DF) > late forest (LF). We aimed to understand how and the degree to which BAF fragmentation and human disturbance affected plants, soils, and the whole soil-plant relationships and feedbacks. We investigated the natural regeneration conditions of plants (using plant classification and quali-quantitative analyses) and soil chemistry (including pH-CaCl2, H + Al, C, N, Pt, cation-exchange capacity (CEC), exchangeable cations, Al, B, Cu, Fe, K, Mn, and Zn) at twelve permanent, 2000 m2 plots, distributed across LF, DF, and SF forests. Significant differences were determined by ANOVA. Correlation matrix (CM) and factor analysis (FA) were used for understanding correlations and feedbacks/variability among investigated parameters, respectively. Most of investigated plant and soil parameters showed significant differences (p < 0.05) between more developed plant formations (LF) vs less developed ones (SF), with differences mainly due to soil's development stage. All investigated forest formations are featured by a great influence of the soil-plant relationships and feedbacks, with a decreasing magnitude as LF → DF → SF. Thus, there is a direct, statistically recognizable impact of both “recent” as well as “ancient” human disturbance on investigated soil-plant formations. The anthropogenic influence clearly affected not only plant and soil as “separate” systems but the whole complex of interactions and feedbacks among ecosystem components. A decreasing quality in soil and plant parameters was observed as human disturbance increased. We demonstrated that BAF plant and soil require decades for their recovery after human disturbances, with complex mechanisms and behaviors in the relationships among ecosystem components. The results can be useful for managing future recovery in an ecosystem of worldwide strategic importance. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Background: Cocoa is an important tropical tree crop that is mainly cultivated in agroforestry systems (AFS). This system, known as cabruca in northeastern Brazil, holds promise to reconcile biodiversity conservation and economic development. However, since cocoa AFS alters forest structure composition, it can affect litter dynamics in riparian zones and streams. Thus, our objective was to determine litter inputs and standing stocks in riparian zones and streams under three types of forest: managed cocoa AFS, abandoned cocoa AFS, and secondary forest. Methods: We determined terrestrial litter fall (TI), vertical (VI) and lateral (LI) litter inputs to streams, and litter standing stocks on streambeds (BS) in the Atlantic Forest of northeastern Brazil. Litter was collected every 30 days from August 2018 to July 2019 using custom-made traps. The litter was dried, separated into four fractions (leaves, branches, reproductive organs, and miscellaneous material) and weighed. Results: Terrestrial litter fall was similar in all forests, ranging from 89 g m−2 month−1 in secondary forest (SF) to 96 g m−2 month−1 in abandoned cocoa AFS (AC). Vertical input were higher in AC (82 g m−2 month−1) and MC (69 g m−2 month−1) than in SF (40 g m−2 month−1), whereas lateral input were higher in MC (43 g m−2 month−1) than in AC (15 g m−2 month−1) and SF (24 g m−2 month−1). Standing stocks followed the order SF > AC > MC, corresponding to 425, 299 and 152 g m−2. Leaves contributed most to all litter fractions in all forests. Reproductive plant parts accounted for a larger proportion in managed AFS. Branches and miscellaneous litter were also similar in all forests, except for higher benthic standing stocks of miscellaneous litter in the SF. Despite differences in the amounts of litter inputs and standing stocks among the forests, seasonal patterns in the abandoned AFS (AC) were more similar to those of the secondary forest (SF) than the managed AFS, suggesting potential of abandoned AFS to restore litter dynamics resembling those of secondary forests. © 2022 Rialli Santos Brandão et al.

AB  - Planting native trees in high diversity has been widely recommended to recover tropical forests to regain ecosystems that are taxonomically and functionally similar to the native forests. However, whether planting mixed stands would provide better results than planting pure stands remains to be demonstrated. Aiming to support seasonal tropical forest restoration in the highly fragmented landscape of the Atlantic Forest, Brazil, we compared the long-term (from 24 to 53 years) outcomes of pure and mixed plantings of native tree species with a broad spectrum of reference ecosystems (degraded, secondary, and old-growth forests). We aimed to verify if pure plantings would be as successful in fostering natural regeneration as mixed plantings and if they could potentially reach the attributes of native forests in the same region. We assessed forest structure (density, biomass, basal area), richness, and taxonomic and functional diversity. We separately analyzed the upper, intermediate, and lower layers of the tree community and assessed the abundance of ferns and climbers. Functional traits included seed dispersal and pollination syndromes, growth rate, seed mass, and specific leaf area. Contrary to our expectations, pure and mixed plantings did not differ in tree density, species richness, and functional diversity. Mixed plantings had higher basal area and biomass, surpassing the reference ecosystems and higher taxonomic diversity, whereas pure plantings had more ferns, climbers, and saplings regenerating in the understory. There was no difference for most of the functional traits between the forest types, except in seed mass, which was higher in mixed plantings. Zoochorous species were dominant in all forest types and size classes. In pure plantings, fast-growing species prevailed, whereas moderate and slow-growth species predominated in the other forest types. Pure plantings did not differ from the reference ecosystems, except in taxonomic diversity and richness when compared with the old-growth forests, which takes longer to be achieved. Our results indicate that the sparse remnants of forests are still effective sources of propagules to colonize the plantings – whether using a single species or a mix – even in a highly fragmented landscape, which was the case in our study. In general, pure plantings were as effective as mixed plantings to foster the recovery of seasonal tropical forests in terms of structure and functionality in the long term. As for taxonomic diversity and richness, mixed plantings were more efficient, whereas pure plantings have not reached old-growth forests but did not differ from degraded and surpassed secondary forests in several attributes. These results highlight the relevance of planting trees, even in low diversity, for increasing biodiversity and providing ecosystem services on a landscape scale. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The Atlantic Forest is the most fragmented and threatened domain in Brazil. The main remnants are in the coastal regions. This paper describes a study performed at a protected federal reserve in Brazil located in western of São Paulo state, which is a transition with the Savannah. A forestry survey was made for understanding the forest structure, diversity, and floristic composition of an inland Atlantic Forest area. A total of 3,181 individuals with a Diameter at Breast Height over 3.5 cm were sampled. The data sample was composed of 29 families and 64 species from 15 plots. Forty-seven percent of the species were classified as a pioneer, 42% as secondary, and 11% as climax. The species Eugenia uniflora presented the highest importance value index. The values of Shannon-Weaver diversity and Pielou equitability index indicate the area has less diversity than others in the same phytophysiognomy and was dominated by a few species with many individuals. Several anthropogenic disturbances altered the forest cover of the Ponte Branca Forest remnant, which is in the process of secondary succession. © 2022 Faculty of Geography UGM and The Indonesian Geographers Association.

AB  - This work performs an analysis of the spatial pattern of the coffee harvested area in the Rio de Janeiro state between 1988 and 2018. To relate changes in land cover and land use with the coffee land abandonment, geographically weighted regressions (GWR) were adopted with the rates of change in forest and pasture cover, and also with changes in the size of the cattle herd. The coffee-crop area evolution identifies three behaviors: the concentration of planted area in the northwest, with constant growth after the 1990s; a remaining area in the mountainous region; and the abandonment of coffee farms in the south. Although bivariate models can’t explain the changes in land cover and land use, geographically weighted regressions point to a trend of replacing coffee cover with pasturelands in the south region of the state, while eventual changes for forest cover are more likely in other regions. © Copyright © 2021 by the American Geographical Society of New York.

AB  - Potter wasps (Hymenoptera, Vespidae, Eumeninae) adopt different substrates for nesting, including other wasp nests. Nevertheless, such behavior rarely occurs with abandoned nests of the paper wasps (Hymenoptera, Vespidae, Polistinae). In this study, we report the occurrence involving the nesting of a potter wasp on a paper wasp’s nest. Such a record occurred in November 2021 in a segment of a deciduous forest, at Mata Seca State Park, Southeast Brazil. An abandoned Polistinae nest was found, with 14 cells sealed with mud, from which four male Pachodynerus nasidens individuals emerged. This record of P. nasidens reusing a Polistinae’s nest increases our knowledge of Eumeninae nesting strategies and on possible associations between different groups of vespid wasps. © 2022 Pensoft Publishers.

AB  - Ecological knowledge plays a significant role in ensuring efficient ecological restoration. We conducted a systematic review to assess if sufficient ecological knowledge has been accumulated to aid restoration practices for the Cerrado, a Brazilian biome dominated by savanna ecosystems and threatened by anthropogenic disturbances. Most Cerrado restoration studies were performed by few research groups and focused primarily on two vegetation types: Cerrado sensu stricto (typical savanna) and riparian forest. We also found that defining reference ecosystems and selecting plant species for restoration programs is neglected, mostly disregarding their original occurrence and proportion of plant growth forms. Furthermore, studies lacked standardized and systematic evaluation of restoration outcomes. Hence, we argue that current ecological knowledge is insufficient to guarantee the success of large-scale ecological restoration of the Cerrado. We strengthen the need to explicitly define the reference ecosystem for each Cerrado ecosystem and use its structure and composition as guidance for ecological restoration research, which should be based on a scientific approach. We encourage investigations into ecological dynamics and natural regeneration of the different vegetation types of the Cerrado and highlight the importance of integrating such knowledge with environmental laws, societal engagement and cost-effective techniques to advance Cerrado ecological restoration. © 2022, Academia Brasileira de Ciencias.

AB  - Given the current global environmental crisis, restoring degraded ecosystems stands out among the nature-based solutions to mitigate climate change, reestablish ecosystem services, and maintain biodiversity and human well-being. The high biodiversity of the Atlantic Forest (AF) and its severe degradation turned it into a “restoration hotspot.” We performed a bibliometric analysis of the research on restoration of the Brazilian AF to identify thematic trends, potential gaps, as well as networks and benefits of collaboration. We also explored the spatial distribution of degradation, restoration science, and practice within the AF. We analyzed 932 articles on the issue from the Web of Science platform (1990–2020). Publications abruptly increased in the last 15 years, first by Brazilian groups and later in collaboration with foreign groups. International collaboration increased the probability of highly cited articles. Topics addressed have changed greatly in their relative position over time, likely due to scientific advances refuting theories or invalidating failed techniques. Natural regeneration was the main trending topic, while forest succession was the main emerging topic, and ecosystem services appeared as a trending topic. Research and restoration initiatives were both unevenly distributed throughout the AF region, with the southeastern region of Brazil standing out (60% of publications). The percentage of the original AF undergoing restoration is very low in all regions, regardless of scientific publications or AF extent remaining. The knowledge gaps pointed—climate change and functional traits—should drive priorities for research funding, aiming to provide robust evidence to support decision-making processes as well as restoration practices. © 2022 Society for Ecological Restoration.

AB  - Functional composition is an important driver of aboveground biomass (AGB) variation in the tropical forest and has been demonstrated through the mass ratio hypotheses (MRH) that explain how dominant species and their functional traits have an important role in the AGB increase. We hypothesized that AGB stock of tree species is promoted by the simultaneous effects of restoration treatments and Technosol quality through functional trait composition. We tested the main effects of taxonomic, stand structural, functional attributes and abiotic factors undergoing different restoration methods (planting of nursery-grown seedlings, seeding, and natural regeneration) and the effect of Technosol fertilization on AGB using different linear models. The functional traits were based on the community-weighted mean of the community of values of functional traits related to MRH. Stems and biomass distribution were categorized into the following functional groups: successional strategy, dispersal syndrome, nitrogen fixation, wood density (WD). As expected, during early restoration stage, the pioneer and anemochoric species were dominants mainly represented by naturally regenerated stems. However, the autochoric dispersal and nitrogen-fixing tree species were biomass dominant groups in active restoration, driven mostly by Senna alata which had high abundance and WD. We found that high WD and active restoration methods determine higher AGB stock on mining tailings where natural regeneration is limited. We conclude that functional composition reverses the effects of species richness and abundance on AGB tenting the MRH. Therefore, the effects of functional composition and restoration methods are key predictors on ecosystem functioning during forest restoration. © 2021 Society for Ecological Restoration.

AB  - Tailings from bauxite mining in Porto Trombetas (Pará state, Central Amazonia, Brazil) was discharged (1979–1989) into Batata Lake affecting about 30% of its area. The lake belongs to a clear-water flood-plain system along the Trombetas River, a tributary of the Amazon River. Siltation is the main perceived factor impacting aquatic and flooded communities. Besides natural regeneration, a program to restore a section of igapó forest in the impacted area (IA) has been conducted since 1991. Decreased light is the main factor reducing total phytoplankton biomass (PhyBM) in IA. We hypothesized that PhyBM in IA increases over time because of the improvement of the underwater light conditions due to the natural regeneration and restoration. We sampled quarterly PhyBM and limnological variables (depth, transparency, temperature, pH, conductivity, dissolved oxygen, turbidity, suspended solids, total Kjeldahl nitrogen, and total phosphorus), over 15 years (2005–2019) at eight sampling sites in the two areas (N = 349). We also obtained daily climatic and hydrologic data. PhyBM was higher in NIA than in IA. The temporal trend in the annual mean of PhyBM increased significantly over time only in the IA, approximating the NIA values, confirming our general hypothesis. The increase of PhyBM in the IA was negatively related to the residual light attenuation caused by non-phytoplankton turbidity and to total phosphorus, and positively to air temperature and site depth (p < 0.05; Marginal r2 = 0.18; Conditional r2 = 0.29). Instead, in NIA, PhyBM was explained only by the increase in air temperature (p < 0.05; Marginal r2 = 0.15; Conditional r2 = 0.34). We concluded that the PhyBM in the IA positively responds to the synergy between increasing light availability, air temperature, and site depth, and decreasing total phosphorus concentrations, regardless of hydrologic phase. © 2022, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro.

AB  - The objective was to characterize the composition of the epiedaphic macrofauna in areas undergoing initial forest restoration using different restoration technologies and to compare these parameters with a reference forest. The study was conducted in the experimental area of Ecological Restoration of the UTFPR, Dois Vizinhos/Paraná state, in randomized blocks, composed of three treatments (RP-passive restoration, PAD-high diversity planting, and NC-nucleation) with four repetitions. Adjacent to this, the fragment of secondary native forest (FL), is used as a reference. The collections were made in November 2010 and April 2011, and three pitfall traps were installed in each plot. Richness and abundance were submitted to normality tests, homogeneity of variance and analysis of variance, and the Shannon and Pielou indices were calculated. The abundance data of the taxonomic groups were submitted to principal component analysis (PCA). To verify the differences in the macrofauna composition between the forest and restoration technologies, similarity analysis (ANOSIM) and percentage of similarity (SIMPER) were performed. We sampled 12,681 individuals, 3,018 in November/2010 and 9,663 in April/2011, distributed in 23 orders. The abundance and richness of the forest differed significantly from the restorative technologies in both assessments. The high abundance observed in the restorative techniques reflected the dominance of Hymenoptera, Coleoptera and Polyxenida. FL showed higher diversity and equitability, regardless the sampling season. The PCA separated the forest technologies by differences in the composition of the edaphic fauna, and the same did not occur between the restoration techniques. In ANOSIM and SIMPER the main orders contributing to the forest differentiation of the technologies in November/10 were Diptera, Coleoptera, Orthoptera, Blattodea, and in April/11 Polyxenida, Hemiptera, Hymenoptera and Orthoptera. The edaphic macrofauna was influenced by the degree of anthropic interference, being a good indicator of environmental changes and ecological succession observed in areas undergoing initial forest restoration. © 2022, Universidade Federal de Santa Maria.

AB  - Modeling diameter distribution in natural forests is an important tool for understanding the native woody species dynamics, supporting decision-making for degraded lands management and restoration. Therefore, this work aimed to fit probabilistic density functions to evaluate the diameter structure of three tree species with economic interest, such as Campomansesia xanthocarpa Marl. Ex. O. Berg, Piptadenia gonoacantha (Mart.) J.F. Macbr. and Zeyheria tuberculosa (Vell.) Bureau ex Verl., in a Semideciduous Seasonal Forest fragment at São Paulo State, Brazil. The data came from 83 temporary plots of 10 m x 20 m systematically distributed along 164 ha. Log-normal, Gamma, and Weibull functions were fitted to the three species using the fitdistrplus-package in the R program. Kolmogorov-Smirnov’s adherence test was used to evaluate the fits at a 5% probability level. The functions were selected employing Akaike’s Information Criterion (AIC) and Schwarz’s Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), in addition to a graphical analysis of the fitted functions. The results indicated that the three species diameter structure is positively asymmetric, representing the exponential pattern, representing continuous natural regeneration. AIC and BIC statistics indicated the Log-normal function to describe the diameter distribution of C. xanthocarpa and Z. tuberculosa, while the Gamma function was the most appropriate for P. gonoacantha. For the three species, the graphical analysis showed the Gamma function results in the best fit without tendency for estimating frequency density per diameter class. © 2023, Sociedade de Investigacoes Florestais.

AB  - In 2020, fires in the Pantanal, the world's largest continuous tropical wetland, made global news. The flames destroyed almost one-third of the biome. Furthermore, 43% of the affected area was burnt for the first time in 20 or even more years. As the combination of extreme drought and anthropogenic actions that caused these extreme wildfires is still prevalent, scientifically informed actions are necessary to prevent catastrophic fires in the future. Fire prevention, as well as restoration need to be spatially prioritised, as it is unfeasible to plan actions for the whole extent (150,355 km2) of the Brazilian Pantanal. In this study, we identified areas of high fire risk based on meteorological fire risk tendency for 1980–2020, fire intensity, last year with fire, the recurrence of fires for 2003–2020, and remaining areas of natural forest vegetation around watercourses. These native remnants include unburnt areas that can serve as refuges for fire-sensitive species and are important for fire prevention. We identified 246 km2 with high fire risk, i.e., high probability of megafires, with vegetation types that support fire-sensitive plant species. We found that while 179 km2 had high or medium natural regeneration potential, 66 km2 had low potential and needed active restoration. Over 3120 km2 have been severely degraded by recent fires. About 93% of these areas have high or medium potential for natural regeneration, where the suggested actions are passive restoration and Integrated Fire Management. We estimated the cost of post-fire restoration for areas with high and medium potential for natural regeneration to be around 123 million USD. In areas with low regeneration potential (219 km2), we suggest active restoration. The cost to restore these areas using transplanted seedlings or enrichment planting is estimated between 28 and 151 million USD. © 2021

AB  - Plants emit a broad number of Biogenic Volatile Organic Compounds (BVOCs) that can impact urban ozone (O3) production. Conversely, the O3 is a phytotoxic pollutant that causes unknown alterations in BVOC emissions from native plants. In this sense, here, we characterized the constitutive and O3-induced BVOCs for two (2dO3) and four (4dO3) days of exposure (O3 dose 80 ppb) and evaluated the O3 response by histochemical techniques to detect programmed cell death (PCD) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in three Brazilian native species. Croton floribundus Spreng, Astronium graveolens Jacq, and Piptadenia gonoacantha (Mart.) JF Macbr, from different groups of ecological succession (acquisitive and conservative), different carbon-saving defense strategies, and specific BVOC emissions. The three species emitted a very diverse BVOC composition: monoterpenes (MON), sesquiterpenes (SEQ), green leaf volatiles (GLV), and other compounds (OTC). C. floribundus is more acquisitive than A. graveolens. Their most representative BVOCs were methyl salicylate—MeSA (OTC), (Z) 3-hexenal, and (E)-2-hexenal (GLV), γ-elemene and (−)-β-bourbonene (SEQ) β-phellandrene and D-limonene (MON), while in A. graveolens were nonanal and decanal (OTC), and α-pinene (MON). Piptadenia gonoachanta is more conservative, and the BVOC blend was limited to MeSA (OTC), (E)-2-hexenal (GLV), and β-Phellandrene (MON). The O3 affected BVOCs and histochemical traits of the three species in different ways. Croton floribundus was the most O3 tolerant species and considered as an SEQ emitter. It efficiently reacted to O3 stress after 2dO3, verified by a high alteration of BVOC emission, the emergence of the compounds such as α-Ionone and trans-ß-Ionone, and the absence of H2O2 detection. On the contrary, A. graveolens, a MON-emitter, was affected by 2dO3 and 4dO3, showing increasing emissions of α-pinene and β-myrcene, (MON), γ-muurolene and β-cadinene (SEQ) and H2O2 accumulation. Piptadenia gonoachanta was the most sensitive and did not respond to BVOCs emission, but PCD and H2O2 were highly evidenced. Our results indicate that the BVOC blend emission, combined with histochemical observations, is a powerful tool to confirm the species’ tolerance to O3. Furthermore, our findings suggest that BVOC emission is a trade-off associated with different resource strategies of species indicated by the changes in the quality and quantity of BVOC emission for each species.

AB  - Ecological restoration aims to recover an ecosystem to a state before degradation. Comparison to reference ecosystems (old-growth forests) is a key component to define if restoration goals have been achieved (“success”). Nevertheless, it is still unknown how the functional composition of the initial community influences the trajectory of the ecosystem through time. Here, we evaluated restoration success based on the functional trajectory of six 20-year-old forest communities planted in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest with distinct combinations of ecological groups (pioneers, secondary, and climax). These six communities ranged their species predominance regarding resource-use strategies, potential size, and functional diversity. To evaluate restoration success, we compared the functional trajectory between the six planted communities after 20 years of secondary succession and calculated their trajectories toward or away from the reference ecosystem. We found that the initial composition influenced the functional trajectory of the communities undergoing restoration and it was a key element to their success. Only the community planted using the highest functional diversity (i.e. pioneer + early and late secondary + climax species) became functionally similar to the reference ecosystem 20 years after planting. The functional trajectories were mostly driven by the mortality of planted individuals than by the colonization of new species. The regeneration is still functionally similar independently of the treatment evidencing little influence of priority effects in this stage of succession. Our study indicated that the initial functional composition of planted forest communities influences the magnitude and direction of their functional trajectory and may influence restoration success. © 2022 Society for Ecological Restoration.

AB  - The existing megabiodiversity in Brazil is represented a variety of biomes, such as the Atlantic Forest, which is considered one of the most biodiverse biomes in the world. However, this biodiversity has been threatened by human activities, resulting in habitat fragmentation and environmental degradation. Techniques recommended by ecological restoration science have been applied to reverse environmental degradation and promote the restoration of vegetation. Qualitative and quantitative information on the vegetation of areas in the process of secondary succession constitutes important subsidies for the application of active restoration techniques based on the planting of seedlings. This work presents a floristic and phytosociological study of the tree-shrub component of 12-year-old riparian vegetation that spontaneously regenerated in an area of abandoned pasture (passive restoration). Information regarding species abundance, dispersal syndrome (zoochory, anemochory and autochory), successional category (pioneer and non-pioneer) and extinction threaten was compiled. A total of 856 individuals were sampled, where 60 native species and four exotic ones were identified, distributed in 31 families. The most abundant families were Myrtaceae, Euphorbiaceae and Fabaceae, with 431, 175 and 60 individuals, respectively. The richest families were Myrtaceae and Fabaceae with 11 and seven species, respectively. The most abundant and frequent species were Myrcia selloi, Gymnanthes klotzschiana, Myrcia subcordata, Sebastiania brasiliensis, Myrcia glomerata and Eugenia involucrata. The zoochoric dispersal syndrome was the most common with 38 species and 547 individuals. The non-pioneer successional category predominated with 33 species and 533 individuals. No endangered species were found in the area. The information available in this study may support projects for the active restoration of riparian forests in the region. © 2021 The authors.

AB  - The Brazilian Atlantic Forest is considered one of the most threatened tropical forests in the world due to the extensive environmental impact it has endured throughout history. Only 12.4% of its original vegetation is estimated to remain. Even though reduced and highly fragmented, it houses enormous biodiversity, and its preservation is paramount to the maintenance of the country’s fauna, flora, funga and microbiota. One of the most efficient measures adopted by public agencies aimed at protecting biodiversity has been the creation of conservation units. To evaluate the preservation state of protected areas, several environmental studies have been performed; species inventories are one among them. Ants are excellent bioindicators, for they are not only sensitive to environmental changes, but they also have a history of being used in impact assessment (i.e., fragmentation). In this study we assessed the ant communities inhabiting the leaf litter in areas with different regeneration states at the RPPN Botujuru – Serra do Itapety (Mogi das Cruzes, São Paulo – Brazil). Mini-Winkler traps were used in the ant survey, and diversity analyses were performed. In total, we recorded 86 species of ants, with a highlight to Camponotus cillae Forel, 1912, a species that remained unrecorded for the state of São Paulo for over 100 years, and a possible new species of Octostruma Forel, 1912. Overall, the species found show that the areas are in the process of natural regeneration. Our data on RPPN Botujuru is unprecedented, and our species list has the potential of being used as an effective monitoring tool for this conservation unit. © 2022, Universidade de Sao Paulo.

AB  - The present study explored the influence of edaphic variables and forest leaf cover on natural regeneration in a remnant of a Mixed Ombrophilous Forest (MOF) in southern Brazil. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to elucidate the heterogeneity of edaphic and leaf cover variables among the sampling units, and the variables exhibiting the strongest correlations with the sampling units were selected. Subsequently, these variables were used to explain floristic patterns using canonical correspondence analysis (CCA). In PCA, the leaf area index explained only some variation in the data, and there was obvious heterogeneity in edaphic variables among the sample units. In the main canonical axis of the CCA, Miconia cubatanensis, Myrcia multiflora, Casearia decandra, and Myrsine coriacea showed greater correlation with variables associated with soil acidity. In contrast, Allophylus guaraniticus and Cupania vernalis showed a high correlation with variables related to bases. Overall, the analysis of soil physicochemical characteristics can allow for the more precise identification of indicator species for the restoration of remnant of MOF in southern Brazil. © 2022 Instituto de Pesquisas Jardim Botanico do Rio de Janeiro.

AB  - There has been widespread clearance of tropical forests for agriculture, but in many cases the cultivation phase is only transient. The secondary forests recovering on these abandoned sites may contribute to mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions and protection of biodiversity, but the rates of recovery may be dependent on land-use intensity and changes in soil properties during cultivation. However fine-scale details on these changes are poorly known for many tropical forest locations. We quantified soil properties and recovery of woody biomass in 42 tropical forest fragments representing a chronosequence following two types of agricultural land-uses, and in 15 comparable reference old growth forests, between the Andes and the Amazon in Peru. Soil fertility, particularly base cation concentrations, responded negatively to increasing intensity of agricultural land-use, and either decreased or increased with time after abandonment dependent on prior land-use. The predicted mean recovery rate of woody biomass over the first 20 years following abandonment matched that predicted by a general model for the Neotropics, but recovery was three-fold higher on sites abandoned following traditional agriculture than on sites recovering from intensive agriculture. Estimated total biomass recovered to just above half that of reference old growth forests within 71 years. The inclusion of the biomass of lianas and smaller tree stems did not modify the apparent rate of ecosystem biomass recovery, however the proportion of the total biomass stored in small stems was greater following intensive than traditional agriculture, which suggests that patterns of stand structural development are sensitive to land-use history. We conclude that effects of historic land use on soil nutrient concentrations and their changes through time are required for a more complete interpretation of variation in biomass recovery rates at local scales. These results also highlight the critical importance of contemporary agricultural intensification for carbon storage in tropical forests. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Changes in the vegetation of Brazilian Cerrado may occur over time. However, long-term dynamics are not fully understood yet, especially woody plant encroachment (WPE). The objective of this study was to examine changes in vegetation structure in a preserved area in Tri ngulo Mineiro region, within the southern Brazilian Cerrado domain, over 32 years (1987, 2005, and 2019). We based the study on field and literature surveys, as well as satellite imagery, and hypothesized that, due to the absence of periodic fires or grazing, Cerrado open formations (i.e., grassland or savanna) tend to become denser due to WPE. Shrubby grassland cover assessed in 1987 disappeared in the following periods (from 30.0% to 0.0% in 2019) while forest formations increased (from 7.0% in 1987 to 11.0% in 2019). Changes between 2005 and 2019 occurred within the stricto sensu cerrado subdivisions, with reduction of sparse cerrado (from 34.2% to 7.7 %) and an increase in dense cerrado (from 6.9% to 39.8 %). Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) applied for similar periods indicates a progressive increase of values over time (from 1986 (0:61-0:10) to 2004 (0:65-0:06) and 2018 (0:78-0:05)) and corroborates the WPE process. These patterns imply the loss of biodiversity in open plant formation. Another major consequence was the reduction of wetlands and possible impact on water supply. Such patterns are important to support plant management plans for the threatened Cerrado open plant formations. © 2021 Copernicus GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB  - The mapping of sugarcane plantations and their changes is relevant to the economy and the environment, notably due to sugarcane's interface in the biofuel industry through ethanol. The necessary mapping of sugarcane crop changes is especially challenging when plantation occurs under smallholders' land ownership structures used for heterogeneous crop management. We evaluated two approaches to address this challenge with the example of sugarcane abandonment in the Norte Fluminense Region, Northeastern Rio de Janeiro state, Brazil. The region is characterized by a large share of smallholders. We trained a random forest classifier for sugarcane for 2018 based on all available Landsat imagery. Based on the concept of temporal generalization, we applied the classifier trained in 2018 for the period from 1986 until 2020. The resulting annual sugarcane probability maps were used as input for two abandonment mapping methods: LandtrendR and muti-temporal cropland abandonment mapping. The performance of both approaches was evaluated based on a stratified sampling approach. We detected three distinct trajectories for sugarcane farmland: i) permanently abandoned sugarcane, ii) fallow sugarcane, and iii) and stable sugarcane. The multi-temporal cropland abandonment mapping performed better for the sugarcane abandonment class (F1 = 0.84) than the LandtrendR approach (F1 = 0.21). The LandtrendR results revealed a higher omission (PA = 0.12) in mapping the sugarcane abandonment class. For the multi-temporal cropland abandonment mapping, we found that 66% (67,353 ha) of the stable sugarcane areas were abandoned between 1990 and 2016. The highest abandonment rates occurred between 1990 and 1994 and between 2010 and 2016. The spatial distribution of abandonment was heterogeneous. The earliest abandonment was concentrated in the northern part of the study area. The most recent abandonment was more extensive in the southern part of the study site. Our results highlight the advantages and challenges of using Landsat time series to map sugarcane abandonment in a heterogeneous management system. Our results also highlight the spatially and temporal heterogeneous pattern of sugarcane abandonment in the region and provide the necessary database for subsequent studies to identify underlying and proximate causes for the abandonment. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Forest regeneration has increased in many tropical abandoned lands and current restoration commitments in this region aim to restore over 1,400,000 km2 of degraded land by 2030. Although regenerating forests recover biomass, biodiversity, and processes with time, the recovery trajectories may be uncertain due to past disturbances. Currently, there is a lack of knowledge to sustain the effectiveness of passive regeneration for the recovery of riparian forests and the adjacent waterbodies in the tropics, which may compromise the outcomes of ongoing and future tropical riparian restoration programs. We evaluated the drivers of riparian forest structural recovery and how this relates to stream conditions in 12 abandoned pasturelands in eastern Brazilian Amazonia. These pasturelands range across regeneration age (pasture (PA) — 0 to 4 years; young regeneration (YR) — 8 to 12 years; old regeneration (OR) — 18 to 22 years) and years of past land-use (PA — 23.25 average years of past land-use, YR — 18.25, OR — 7). We compared the conditions of these sites to 4 reference sites with conserved forests (REF, >100 years), where there was no recorded pasture use in the past. Short-term responses of forests and streams to passive regeneration indicated high ecosystem resilience after low to intermediate past land-use intensity, reflected in the improvement of stream ecosystems. Such high resilience is possibly attributable to low- to intermediate-intensity pasture-related disturbances, remaining forest matrix, and residual structures (e.g. roots, sprouts, and in-stream wood) observed in the area. Our results suggest a recovery by 12 to 20 years for riparian forests of this region. However, areas degraded by intensive land-use apparently showed delayed recovery. We conclude that seizing resilience windows (defined here as the period when ecosystems retain high potential resilience) is essential to foster passive recovery of riparian forests and streams more cost-effectively in the tropics. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Tropical montane cloud forests (TMCF) have paramount importance with regards to hydrological and ecological functions. Despite such importance in terms of water provision, they are one of the most endangered ecosystems on the planet. One important topic that is still unclear is related to TMCF regeneration: can it recover the hydrological function of such critical ecosystems? In the present paper, the hydrological effects of the natural regeneration of TMCF were examined. We selected three catchments with different degrees of TMCF, and we examined the relationship between the amount of TMCF over time and hydrological variables such as water yields and baseflow using a time series (1984–2011). Our results suggest that the increase in TMCF cover can contribute to increases in water yield. This pattern was found in a catchment with an increase of approximately 20% of forest cover. In catchments with TMCF increase lower than this threshold, water yield and flow path were influenced by hydroclimatic variables such as air temperature and rainfall. The effect of the reduction in water yield, in accordance with the increase in mean temperature, sheds light on possible consequences of climate change on ecosystem services produced in foggy environments. In light of these findings, aiming to increase the water yield, we recommend that regions frequently affected by fog are prioritized for forest restoration or conservation. To ensure significant effects, regeneration and/or successional development of TMCF has to reach at least 20% of a catchment area. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Natural regeneration is becoming more frequently used on a global level as a method of ecological restoration after mining operations. The objective of this study was to investigate forest restoration as a function of the exclusive use of natural regeneration in systems with two (NR2) and seven (NR7) years of age after bauxite mining in Eastern Amazon, Brazil (3° 14′ 51″–3° 15′ 48″ S and 47° 44′ 14″–47° 43′ 09″ W). Soil's physical and chemical parameters (organic matter, bulk density, porosity, infiltration, and fertility), landscape-level quantification of vegetation in the areas surrounding the study sites and attributes of the established vegetation (abundance of individuals and families, Shannon diversity index, evenness index, and ecological dominance index) were assessed. The method of natural regeneration, in seven years, was efficient to occupy and cover the soil by regenerating tree and shrub species, as well to contribute to the recovery of important surface-depth attributes of the quality of rebuilt soils, such as organic matter, nutrient availability, density, porosity, and water infiltration. The regenerating tree and shrub species had low diversity and high dominance of a few pioneer species, which indicates the necessity of introducing early and late secondary successional species to correct the successional trajectory in order to ensure the ecosystem restoration. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - American cutaneous leishmaniasis (ACL) is a notifiable dermatozoonosis with relevant morbidity. The present study aimed to evaluate the epidemiological aspects of cases of ACL reported in Northern Paraná (2007–2016), as well as to georeference and analyse the influence of economic, social and environmental variables. Data from ACL notification forms were obtained and the patients' houses were georeferenced. Descriptive statistics, calculations of disease incidence and proportion of vegetation cover by municipality, spatial analysis, multiple linear regression and vulnerability analysis by census sector (CS) were performed. One thousand four hundred fifty-one cases of ACL were reported in the 89 municipalities of four regional health (RH). The average incidence of cases per 10,000 inhabitants was as follows: 11.58, 8.79, 4.92 and 4.03 in 18thRH, 15thRH, 16thRH and 17thRH. Peaks of incident cases were observed in 2008, 2012 and 2015. There was a statistically significant difference between the HR when comparing the proportions of the variables gender, age, education level, area of residence, clinical form, diagnostic criteria, response to treatment and drug used in case of failure. It was observed that the lower the proportion of remaining Atlantic Forest, the greater the incidence of ACL in the municipality. With regard to clusters analysis, treatment abandonment clusters were observed in the 15thRH and mucous form clusters were observed in the 15thRH, 16thRH and 17thRH. The vulnerability analysis by CS allowed us to observe a statistically significant difference in all vulnerability indicators: economic and social in 15thRH and 17thRH; home infrastructure in 15thRH and 18thRH, urban infrastructure in 15thRH and 18thRH and compound vulnerability index in 15thRH and 18thRH. However, the most vulnerable areas did not always have the highest number of cases. The data presented demonstrate that preventive and health education measures must be mainly directed to areas of greater degradation of native forest; regardless of the vulnerability situation. © 2020 Wiley-VCH GmbH

AB  - The degraded areas in Southern Brazil are undergoing rapid conversion from abandoned fields into agroforestry system. Our focus was to investigate the impact of land use and soil properties on soil fauna and quality in an agroforestry system and a natural ecosystem. The agroforestry system had the presence of Cicadidae (0.1 ind trap−1), Diplura (0.01 ind trap−1), Gryllidae (0.2 ind trap−1), Gyrinidae (0.07 ind trap−1), and Larvae (0.3 ind trap−1), and it presents lower SOC (less 44.3%) and higher total N (more 29.8%) and P contents (more 68.8%) when compared with the natural ecosystem. Richness and diversity declined (less than 16.3 and 31.8%, respectively) with increasing soil pH. Natural ecosystem showed the greatest diversity (H’ = 2.44) of soil fauna. A negative correlation was observed between diversity and soil pH (−0.91), and positive correlations among diversity and SOC (0.97), richness (0.88), and dominance (0.93). In conclusion, fauna abundance, precipitation, and soil pH played essential roles in soil quality through ecosystem services, habitat, and energy provision, which in turn promoted the entire soil food web. Thus, the findings in the agroforestry system and natural ecosystem help us to understand how land uses impact soil fauna, and soil quality. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - This study aimed to analyze the temporal changes in the floristic composition and regeneration structure in a remnant of Mixed Ombrophilous Forest that has been without interventions for decades. Two surveys were undertaken for the study; the first survey was conducted in 2012, and the second in 2017. The experimental area comprised 20 circular plots of 2.5 m radius, where was it performed the quantification of the regenerants, measurement of individual tree heights, and identification of the ecological group that each surveyed species belonged. All individuals with a minimum height of 0.50 m and a circumference at breast height of less than 15 cm were measured. Approximately 12,382 ind ha-1 were found in 2012 and 11,185 ind ha-1 in 2017. Only the following species increased their abundance per hectare in 2017 compared to the previous survey: Dalbergia frutescens (280.3 ind ha-1), Myrsine coriacea (178.3 ind ha-1), Allophylus guaraniticus (76.4 ind ha-1), Bernadia pulchella (51.0 ind ha-1), Casearia obliqua (50.9 ind ha-1), Casearia decandra (25.5 ind ha-1), and Luehea divaricata (25.5 ind ha-1). The remaining species had a negative balance or disappeared from the study. Ecological group analysis indicated the gradual replacement of shadow-tolerant climax species by pioneer and light-demanding climax species. The most representative species identified on both occasions did not undergo major changes, indicating that they are more likely to remain in the studied area. The results indicated that the studied remnant forest is in an advanced phase of succession; however, it presents punctual alterations that reflect its floristic and ecological dynamics. © 2022, Universidade Federal de Santa Maria.

AB  - Forest loss and degradation in the Brazilian Amazon due to mining activities has been intense for many years. To reverse this situation, a range of restoration programs for deforested and degraded areas have been created and implemented. The aim of this study was to analyze the tree composition, successional stage, dispersal and pollination syndromes, conservation status of tree species, and proximity to seed sources under different forest restoration techniques (seedling planting, natural regeneration, and assisted natural regeneration or nucleation) implemented in post-mining sites in the Paragominas municipality (Para, Brazil). Sixty permanent plots with a restoration age of three years were selected for tree sampling. A total of 119 species, 83 genera and 27 botanical families were identified. Sites restored with different techniques significantly differed in tree composition. Seedling planting sites exhibited the highest abundance, species richness, and diversity values. These were dominated less by pioneer species when compared to the natural regeneration and nucleation sites. Entomophilic pollination and zoochory dispersal were highly represented in the three types of restored sites. Abundance and species richness were negatively correlated with distance from plots to seed sources, and they sharply declined in natural regeneration and nucleation plots at > 250 m from seed sources. Four threatened species were identified in the restored sites. We conclude that a combination of different restoration strategies at three-year-old post-mining restoration sites in the Brazilian Amazon results in the recovery of considerable levels of local tree diversity. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Hydrological processes in forests are greatly influenced by existing plant species and their specific physiological characteristics. Water consumption by these plant communities is considered important in studies of water availability and water balance, especially in semi-arid regions. The aim of this study was to analyse water storage potential in the stems of representative plants of the Caatinga biome. The study was carried out in a preserved area of Caatinga in the Aiuaba Experimental Basin, Ceará, Brazil, where a phytosociological survey of the spatial distribution of wood density and stem water storage capacity was conducted. Allometric models were developed to estimate the active xylem area. Thirteen species and eight botanical families were registered during the floristic survey. The species with the highest density per hectare are the marmeleiro (Croton sonderianus Mull.) and the catingueira (Poicianella pyramidalis Tul.), reaching 85% of the total number of inventoried species. The water content in the stem of the catingueira is around five times that of the marmeleiro; however, due to their greater occurrence in the area, the amount of water retained in the stem of marmeleiro plants (per hectare) is around twice that of the catingueira plants. After 40 years of conservation, the area is at a stage of secondary succession. The water potential of the species included in the survey is equal to about one fifth of the maximum storage capacity of the reservoir that receives all the water drained from the basin. © 2021.

AB  - Different types of matrices can perform different disturbance regimes over remnant forests, which can ultimately affect plant diversity. To address these issues, we studied 60 plots in forest remnants embedded within sugarcane plantations and pasturelands in the Atlantic Forest of Southeastern Brazil. Our objectives were to evaluate general patterns of plant diversity and to assess the influence of landscape structure and dynamics on plant richness and diversity. We recorded 297 species in two strata. (DBH superior stratum ≥ 4.8 cm > inferior stratum). Overall, diversity of the inferior stratum was higher in pastureland forest remnants than in sugarcane matrices. In the superior stratum, time since abandonment represented a greater influence. Considering the partition of diversity, more than 40% of total diversity was due to the alpha component alone in all cases, but it was significantly lower than expected. Beta components among forest remnants, landscapes and matrices were higher than expected for both strata, whether together or separately. Habitat heterogeneity showed a higher contribution to the total floristic diversity, but among remnants this contribution was even more significant. Forest remnants in pasturelands had a more dynamic land use history and parameters of landscape dynamics were more related to plant diversity. For remnants in the sugarcane matrices, species richness and composition were explained by landscape structure. Our results highlight that there is an important plant community diffused in the forest remnants of human-modified landscapes. Therefore, conserving the majority of remnants and restoring degraded ones must be a key conservation strategy. © 2021 Associação Brasileira de Ciência Ecológica e Conservação

AB  - Large-scale forest restoration relies on approaches that are cost-effective and economically attractive to farmers, and in this context agroforestry systems may be a valuable option. Here, we compared ecological outcomes among (1) 12–15-year-old coffee agroforests established with several native shade trees, (2) 12–15-year-old high-diversity restoration plantations, and (3) reference old-growth forests, within a landscape restoration project in the Pontal do Paranapanema region, in the Atlantic Forest of southeastern Brazil. We compared the aboveground biomass, canopy cover, and abundance, richness, and composition of trees, and the regenerating saplings in the three forest types. In addition, we investigated the landscape drivers of natural regeneration in the restoration plantations and coffee agroforests. Reference forests had a higher abundance of trees and regenerating saplings, but had similar levels of species richness compared to coffee agroforests. High-diversity agroforests and restoration plantations did not differ in tree abundance. However, compared to restoration plantations, agroforests showed higher abundance and species richness of regenerating saplings, a higher proportion of animal-dispersed species, and higher canopy cover. The abundance of regenerating saplings declined with increasing density of coffee plants, thus indicating a potential trade-off between productivity and ecological benefits. High-diversity coffee agroforests provide a cost-effective and ecologically viable alternative to high-diversity native tree plantations for large-scale forest restoration within agricultural landscapes managed by local communities, and should be included as part of the portfolio of reforestation options used to promote the global agenda on forest and landscape restoration. © 2020 Society for Ecological Restoration

AB  - The prominent role assumed by Brazil in the global environmental agenda in recent years has prompted the creation of legal provisions and the formulation of environmental policies and instruments aimed at improved and sustainable territorial governance. Within this context, the Brazilian government implemented in 2016, with the support of the Forest Investment Program (FIP), the first systematic and official monitoring initiative focused on the detection of vegetation suppression (since 2000) in the Cerrado, the second largest biome in Brazil and a global biodiversity hotspot. In this study, we assess, based on sampling procedures and field work, the quality of the PRODES Cerrado data, which is being generated according to the well-known and consolidated PRODES Amazônia methodology. Our sample-based validation indicated an overall accuracy of 93.17 ± 0.89% (in line with the four fieldworks findings) and that the anthropization process in the Cerrado surpassed 50% of the biome in 2013, a situation identified by the PRODES Cerrado only in 2018. Although this discrepancy, there is a very good convergence between the PRODES Cerrado data and the sample estimates in more recent years. In fact, the PRODES Cerrado is a product in process of continuous improvement, in which the quality of the detected deforestation increases over the years. Therefore, the PRODES Cerrado monitoring system is adequate to be used in support of governance instruments capable of curbing or even zeroing deforestation in the biome, where, as our study revealed, there are ~104,000 km2 of abandoned land, which could be used for the expansion of the Brazilian agricultural production in the coming years. © 2020

AB  - Brazil nut (Bertholletia excelsa Bonpl.) is considered the cornerstone non-timber species of Amazonian conservation. Nuts (or seeds) of this massive tree are harvested by local people living in and near old growth forests, supporting local livelihoods and regional economies. Secondary forests, however, particularly plots previously used for agriculture (swidden fallows), present better B. excelsa seedling and sapling recruitment than mature forest. This study examines the extent to which forest residents could increase nut productivity by allowing their fallows to grow into Brazil nut rich forests. We conducted B. excelsa inventories in the Brazilian state of Acre in abandoned swidden fallows of different ages. We also conducted interviews to determine landowner perspectives on the fallow potential for increasing nut production. An individual-based model, based on in-situ inventories and primary and secondary datasets from prior fieldwork, simulated growth, survivorship and production from the 250 inventoried trees in 18 fallows of varying sizes (from 0.41 to 4.18 ha) and different regrowth stages (12 to 60 years old). These simulation model predictions showed that after 10 years, 2.4% of existing trees would be productive, with an average of 68.6 ± 21.5 fruits per reproductively mature tree in the four fallows that most quickly yielded productive trees. By the final projected time interval (40 years), predictions suggest all fallows will produce fruits with cumulative production averaging 1475 ± 359 fruits ha−1, suggesting an increase in landowner income of US$55.1 ± 13.4 per hectare of fallow. Our simulation model is the first to explore fruit productivity of Brazil nut in secondary forest. It likely underpredicts B. excelsa growth and nut production, considering that swidden fallows provide better resource availability than the forest-derived datasets we used to construct the model equations. In conclusion, our findings support previous research that suggests that higher B. excelsa recruitment rates observed in abandoned swidden fallows could indeed translate into greater adult densities and thus potentially, higher nut production – a conclusion mirrored by most participant landowners. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In some regions of Southern Brazil, historic silvopastoral systems, known as caívas in Santa Catarina State and faxinais in Paraná State, are used in remnants of Araucaria Forest. In these systems, the herbaceous stratum of the forest is composed of natural pasture on which animals graze. In order to better understand the impact of caívas on the conservation of the Araucaria Forest, the effects of different intensities of pasture management, mowing practices, and cattle grazing on natural regeneration were assessed. The experiment was carried out in eight caívas from 2015 to 2016, during which the forest regeneration was monitored every six months. Throughout the study period, 48 tree species that are characteristic of the Araucaria Forest were identified. In all evaluated scenarios, the regeneration of tree species was present, dynamic, and continuous in the caívas. The intensity of pasture use did not affect the indicators of diversity, species richness, and regeneration density. However, there was limited similarity among caívas with the same type of pasture management. Mowing had the greatest impact on regeneration, with a marked reduction in the density of regenerants, although it did not affect species richness. Given the abundance of species in the regeneration, including many species typical of advanced forest succession, it is possible to confirm that these systems present high levels of resilience with respect to the conservation of biodiversity, despite the occurrence of livestock grazing for generations. The results also indicate that it is possible to successfully implement strategies for pasture intensification in caívas. However, this practice must be associated with preservation strategies in forest areas that are more fragile and diverse, in order to ensure the system is sustainable across all dimensions. © 2021, Universidade Federal de Santa Maria.

AB  - This study aims to assess the methods of relative efficiency of the sampling in the definition of the area and shape of plots in surveys of regenerating tree in a fragment of the Atlantic Forest in Pernambuco, Brazil. 40 plots were installed for each of the different dimensions analyzed. All individuals with height ≥ 1.0 meter and circumference at breast height (1.30m above of ground) < 15.0cm were cataloged, identified and measured. The sampling and floristic sufficiency, rarefaction curves, Jackknife estimates and the relative efficiency were calculated and plotted for the plots dimensions of 5m x 10m, 10m x 10m and 10m x 25m because they satisfied the sampling error criterion admissible. The sampling of regenerating tree vegetation indicated that the plot of 10m x 10m is the most efficient given the high sampling precision, high species richness and low sampling time. © 2020 University of Sao Paolo.

AB  - This study was conducted in a commercial forest stand of Pinus taeda L. located in Curitibanos, in the State of Santa Catarina, Brazil. The objective of this study was to evaluate the influence of the physical barrier caused by the deposition of aciculas, on natural regeneration mechanisms of native species in sub-woods of P. taeda L. forest stand. Three plots (10 x 10 m) were installed in the sub-woods of the forest stand, and the natural regeneration was evaluated in the control (presence of aciculas) and clean (absence of aciculas) subplots, in addition to the seeds rain and soil seeds bank. The density and frequency parameters (absolute and relative) and the Shannon-Weaver Index (H') were calculated, and the total density values of the seeds rain and seeds bank were subjected to ANOVA (p<0.05), while the density of regenerative seedlings was subjected to Student's t Test (p<0.05), using the Software R Studio ®. The density of regenerative seedlings (ind. m-2) was higher in clean subplots, statistically. No significant statistical difference was observed for the density parameter (ind. m-2) among the subplots for the soil seeds bank, but only for the seeds rain. Shannon Diversity Index was higher in the plots closer to the fragment in all evaluated mechanisms. The obtained results indicate that the litter layer acts as a physical barrier to the breeding of the seeds bank and prevents the arrival of the seeds rain propagules directly to the soil, hindering the establishment of native plants and, consequently, the natural regeneration in the sub-woods. © 2020 Fundacao de Pesquisas Florestais do Parana.

AB  - Natural regeneration is important in the context of the strategies to recover native vegetation in Brazil and of the international commitments of forest restoration undertaken by the country. However, trajectories of recovery can be highly variable and context-dependent, demanding studies to foster the use of secondary forests in restoration. Here, we describe the natural recovery of plant diversity in a chronosequence (5–21 years old) and how it is influenced by age of the regenerating forests. For this, we sampled the floristic composition and structure in 20 fragments of secondary forest in Southeast Pará in 2014 and 2015. Transects of either 10 × 250 m or 20 × 125 m (0.25 ha) were delimited in each forest fragment, and subdivided into 25 subplots of 10 × 10 m, where plants of the upper stratum (DBH ≥ 10 cm) were sampled. The lower stratum (DBH < 10 cm) was sampled in five 5 × 20 m subplots that were nested in the 0.25-ha transects. We recorded 5509 individuals of 282 species and 61 families in the 20 transects evaluated. The species diversity recovery occured rapidly in the first few decades of ecological succession. Floristic composition of the upper stratum was correlated with forest age. Species diversity metrics were predicted by the age and basal area of secondary forests, demonstrating their importance as indicators of successional stages in secondary forests. Our results reinforce the relevance of using secondary forest in restoration programmes across the Amazonian region. © 2020, Botanical Society of Sao Paulo.

AB  - Amazonian tropical rainforest is being converted to other land cover types including crops and pasture. In deforested areas, secondary forest grows after pastures are abandoned, and ‘dirty pasture’ that has trees and shrubs but is actively used for grazing are also regionally important land cover types following forest conversion. This study describes a multistage process land cover classification method to map primary forest, secondary forest, pasture, pasture with trees, built and water in the Brazilian state of Rondônia. A recently developed Spectral Variability Vegetation Index (SVVI) is tested to discriminate land cover types with differing tree cover amounts. Random Forest classifier (RF) is applied to inputs from a) spectral mixture analysis (SMA), and b) tasselled cap (TC) transformation, both with and without SSVI as an additional input feature. SVVI improved the classification accuracy from 73% (TC) to 85% (TC-SVVI), and TC-SVVI yielded a land cover map with higher accuracy than that from SMA-SVVI (82%). Pasture-with-trees, secondary forest and primary forest were all distinguishable with the SVVI.

AB  - In this study, we sought to carry out the floristic and structural characterization of three forest fragments that underwent anthropic intervention, at different time intervals, located in the Environmental Protection Area ‘Lago do Amapá’ in Rio Branco, state of Acre, Brazil. Fragment I has a history of intervention for the formation of pasture and timber extraction in the 1960s. Fragment II has a history of intervention for cutting/burning and planting in the 1970s and Fragment III has a history of intervention for the formation of pastures in the 1980s. For floristic and phytosociological sampling, two plots per fragment measuring 0.5 hectares each (20 m x 250 m) were allocated, totaling an area of three ha. All arboreal individuals with DBH ≥ 10 cm were inventoried. Phytosociological parameters such as dominance, density, frequency, Importance Value (IV) and basal area were calculated. The diversity between fragments was obtained using the Shannon-Weaver index (H’) and similarity using the Jaccard index. The comparisons of means were performed using the Tukey test with 5% significance. Altogether, 1,427 individuals were inventoried, distributed in 44 families and 193 species. The H’ diversity indices found were: 4.21 for Fragment I, 3.74 for Fragment II and 3.50 for Fragment III. The Jaccard index showed a greater similarity between fragments II and III. Fragment I differed statistically from the others in relation to the basal area, number of genera and species. The medium strata (height class 8 ≤ h <16.93) had the largest number of individuals. Regarding the diametric classes, a greater number of first-class individuals was observed, following the inverted J pattern in all fragments. The result of the study pointed out that the fragment with the oldest history of anthropization has structure, richness and diversity of species distinct from the other fragments. © 2021, Universidade Federal de Santa Maria.

AB  - Demand for agricultural areas has suppressed forests throughout the Brazilian coast. Most of these areas have been used for monoculture cultivation, which has distinct microclimatic and structural conditions compared to native forests. Exotic monocultures contribute to the extinction of epiphyte populations and simplify the community. The Elaies guineensis oil palm was introduced in Brazil by African slaves in the 16th century and is considered to be a facilitator of ecological succession, providing shade and organic matter, in addition to attracting seed-dispersing fauna. However, this species behaves as invasive in native environments in different parts of the country, changing the biodiversity and ecosystem services. Herein, we present an evaluation of species composition and community structure of vascular epiphytes in a E. guineensis sub-spontaneous stand (SSEG) in Ilha da Marambaia, Rio de Janeiro state, Brazil. Our goal was to evaluate whether the structure of the vascular epiphyte community has been modified in terms of composition, richness, spatial distribution and functional characteristics. The species richness (S = 23) in the SSEG can be considered low compared to native forests. The functional groups differed from what was expected; the number of characteristic and optional holoepiphytes was lower than expected (30.4% and 17.5% respectively), while the accidental group was higher than expected (30.4%). Among the accidental groups, the vast majority were zoochoric species. Clumped distribution was the most common distribution pattern between epiphyte species, probably because the environmental conditions were more limiting (e.g., low availability of microhabitats) in the SSEG. Phorophyte morphometry generally influenced species richness and epiphyte abundance in the SSEG. These changes in the epiphyte community structure indicate that the low heterogeneity of the stand reduces epiphyte species richness and leads to unrepresentative species (in mature forests) becoming dominant. Although we did not evaluate the contribution of organic matter, these changes in the epiphyte community structure are possibly due to the accumulation of organic matter and moisture in the permanent sheaths of oil palm leaves, which creates conditions for accidental and zoochoric species to colonize this environment. We concluded that the sum of oil palm tree effects is leading to a reduction in the epiphyte diversity in the area. Thus, it is necessary that oil palm monoculture managers monitor and manage these systems, especially those which have been abandoned due to low productivity, in order to control the invasion of this species into natural systems and the consequent diversity loss of vascular epiphytes and other biological groups which are sensitive to invasion. © 2020 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

AB  - Histosols provide several ecosystem services, related mainly to their reserves of carbon and nitrogen. Management practices in these soils can increase the mineralization of organic matter and contribute to the emission of greenhouse gases. This study aimed to investigate the effect of tillage with plowing and drainage on Histosol properties in three land use systems located in the municipality of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Three areas subjected to different land use systems over the last twenty years were chosen: Area 1, secondary forest with natural regeneration; Area 2, conventional tillage of cassava with plowing; and Area 3, intercropped coconut + cassava with an artificial drainage system. The chemical characterization, von Post scale of organic matter decomposition, percentage of rubbed fiber, organic matter, percentage of mineral material, bulk density, electrical conductivity, soluble phosphate, total organic carbon (TOC) and nitrogen (NT), organic carbon fractions, and C and N stocks were analyzed. Our results showed the critical, nearly irreversible effects of agricultural practices comprising drainage and plowing of the soil. Over twenty years, in Area 2, the TOC and NT values decreased by 33 and 20 %, respectively in the histic horizon, and by about 17 and 8 %, respectively in the gley horizon. In Area 3, the TOC and NT values decreased by 31 and 18 %, respectively, in the histic horizon, and by 27 and 21 % in the gley horizon. Our findings also showed that the loss of C is related to the labile organic carbon, which is more sensitive to environmental changes, even at deeper depths. The plowing of the soil decreases the organic matter content due to the accelerated oxidation of organic matter, increasing the bulk density. Drainage, besides the loss of organic matter by subsidence, promotes the sulfidization of the soil with a high content of SO42-, due to the oxidation of soil materials containing sulfides. © 2020, Revista Brasileira de Ciencia do Solo.

AB  - Secondary forests originate from natural regeneration after fallow (succession) or restoration. Species assembly in these communities, which can affect ecosystem functions and successional trajectories, is very unpredictable. Trait-based trajectories can shed light on the recovery of ecosystem functions and enable predictions of how the regenerating communities will change with forest age. Regeneration communities are affected by initial conditions and also by canopy structure and functional traits that alter dispersers' attractiveness and coexistence mechanisms. Here we evaluated how community functional traits change over time and tested if functional diversity and composition of the established canopy, as well as the structure of the canopy and forest age, influence the functional structure of regenerating tree communities when compared to their reference forests. For this, we calculated dissimilarity in trait composition (community-weighted means) and in functional diversity of regenerating communities of each succession/restoration stand, using the tree stratum of nearby mature forests as baseline values. Functional trait information comprises leaf, wood density, and reproductive traits from tree species. Our community data contain information from natural successional forests and restoration sites, in the South-Brazilian Atlantic Forest. Predictor variables of functional dissimilarities were forest age, canopy structural variables, canopy functional composition, and functional diversity. Results showed leaf traits (leaf dry matter content, leaf nitrogen content, leaf nitrogen-phosphorus ratio) and seed mass varying with forest age. Canopy functional composition based on leaf traits and total basal area significantly predicted multiple trait functional dissimilarity between the regeneration component of secondary forests and their reference community values. Dissimilarity increased when the canopy was composed of species with more acquisitive traits. Difference in functional diversity was only influenced by forest age. Mid-stage secondary forests showed lower functional diversity than early-stage forests. Our results indicated the importance of canopy traits on the natural regeneration of secondary subtropical forests. If functional similarity with reference forests is a desired objective in order to recover ecosystem functions through natural regeneration, leaf functional traits of canopy trees that establish or are planted in degraded areas must be considered in the successional processes. © Copyright © 2021 Müller, Bergamin, Bordin, Klipel and Rosenfield.

AB  - The determination of land cover changes (LCCs) and their association to biophysical and socioeconomic factors is vital to support government policies toward the sustainable use of natural resources. The present study aimed to quantify deforestation, forest recovery and net cover change in tropical dry forests (TDFs) in Brazil from 2007 to 2016, and investigate how they are associated to biophysical and socioeconomic factors. We also assessed the effects of LCC variables in human welfare indicators. For this purpose, we used MODIS imagery to calculate TDF gross loss (deforestation), gross gain (forest recovery) and net cover change (the balance between deforestation and forest recovery) for 294 counties in three Brazilian states (Minas Gerais, Bahia, and Piauí). We obtained seven factors potentially associated to LCC at the county level: total county area, road density, humidity index, slope, elevation, and % change in human population and in cattle density. From 2007 to 2016, TDF cover increased from 76,693 to 80,964 km2 (+5.6%). This positive net change resulted from a remarkable forest recovery of 19,018 km2 (24.8%), offsetting a large deforested area (14,748 km2; 19.2%). Practically all these cover changes were a consequence of transitions from TDF to pastures and vice-versa, highlighting the importance of developing sustainable policies for cattle raising in TDF regions. Each LCC variable was associated to different set of factors, but two biophysical variables were significantly associated both to TDF area gained and lost per county: county area (positively) and slope (negatively), indicating that large and flat counties have very dynamic LCCs. The TDF net area change was only associated (negatively) to the humidity index, reflecting an increase in TDF cover in more arid counties. The net increase in Brazilian TDF area is likely a result from an interplay of biophysical and socioeconomic factors that reduced deforestation and caused pasture abandonment. Although the ecological integrity and permanence of secondary TDFs need further investigation, the recovery of this semi-arid ecosystem must be valued and accounted for in the national forest restoration programs, as it would significantly help achieving the goals established in the Bonn agreement and the Atlantic Rain Forest pact. © Copyright © 2020 Espírito-Santo, Rocha, Leite, Silva, Silva and Sanchez-Azofeifa.

AB  - Ecological succession in tropical savannas is limited by seasonal fire, which affects habitat quality. Although fire may cause negligible or positive effects on animals occupying savannas, most short-term studies (months to a few years) are based on a single temporal sampling snapshot, and long-term studies (decades) are rare. We sampled four lizard species (Rainbow Whiptail, Cnemidophorus lemniscatus (Linnaeus, 1758); Striped Whiptail, Kentropyx striata (Daudin, 1802); Grass Anole, Norops auratus Dumeril and Bibron, 1837 = Anolis auratus Daudin, 1802; Amazon Racerunner, Ameiva ameiva (Linnaeus, 1758)) in Amazonian savannas to test the effects of fire and vegetation cover on lizard densities at two temporal scales. In the short term, we use three sampling snap-shots to test the effects of fire and vegetation cover on estimated lizard densities over the subsequent 1-5 years. In the long term, we test the effects of fire and changes in vegetation cover over 21 years on current lizard density differences. In the short term, species responses were usually consistent with foraging and thermoregulation modes. However, the results were not consistent among species and years, although the variances in species density explained by year as a random factor were generally low. In the long term, the main effects of fire and vegetation cover show that lizard densities may change spatially, but not necessarily temporarily. Wildfire is a natural resource of savannas and apparently have little impact on resident lizards of that ecosystem. © 2021, Canadian Science Publishing. All rights reserved.

AB  - Currently, only 40% of Brazil’s Pampa still is covered by original vegetation; however, there is a clear underrepresentation of regional biodiversity in protected areas (PA). Herein, we assessed the extent to which 13 PAs for the Integral Protection in the Brazilian Pampa are effective in conserving samples of the natural attributes and biodiversity of the Pampa. Of all 13 PAs analysed, 11 showed human land uses (range: 0.8–39%) in the legally defined area. Only six PAs had natural land cover above 90%, and abandoned agricultural fields were present in most of the PAs. All buffer zones surrounding PAs for Integral Protection had human land uses. Half of the buffer zones had human-related uses in more than 40% of area. Agricultural mosaics were the most common land uses in the buffer zones. Our study shows that most Pampa PAs are not immune to anthropogenic pressures both inside and around them. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - The study aimed at characterizing the arboreal-shrubby component in fragments of Mixed Ombrophilous Forest, in Rio Grande do Sul State, Brazil. The vegetation survey was performed in four sampled fragments in 57 plots. In the plots, the identification of the individuals and measurement of circumference at breast height (CAP) was carried out, according to the following classes of size: Class I) arboreal strata, individuals with CAP ≥ 30 cm (10 x 20 m); Class II) arboreal strata, individuals with 15 ≤ CAP < 30 cm (10 x 10 m); Class III) established natural regeneration, individuals with 3 ≤ CAP < 15 cm (5 x 5 m) and Class IV) bank of seedlings, individuals with height ≥ 30 cm and CAP < 3 cm (2 x 2 m). The data of Class I constituted a matrix parcel x species, which was used in a multivariate analysis, allowing the classification of groups of plots that characterize microhabitats. The forest fragments presented low floristic richness of typical species of Mixed Ombrophilous Forest. From this environment highlight two main groups, one characteristic of riparian forest and the other from capões. In the riparian forests (GR1), highlighted Eugenia uruguayensis and Gymnanthes klotzschiana. In capões (GR2), the predominant species were Araucaria angustifolia, Podocarpus lambertii and Myrceugenia cucullata. The condition of species in different classes associated with their ecological characteristics allows identifying possible strategies for perpetuation of the arboreal-shrubby component of population and management of the fragments aiming at its conservation. © 2020, Universidad Austral de Chile.

AB  - The replacement of native species by invasive species has caused a worldwide loss of biodiversity. This study aimed to evaluate the natural regeneration over time in a forest fragment invaded by Ligustrum lucidum W.T. Aiton and Ligustrum sinense Lour. in southern Brazil, in order to quantify this invasion. To do so, five transects were allocated in a fragment of Araucaria Forest in Lages, Santa Catarina state, with each transect divided into plots in different categories of distance from the edge and into sub-plots for the evaluation of the regenerative component. In 2012, the regenerating tree species identified in the subplots were tagged and classified according to height classes: Class 1, plants with height between 10 cm and 1 m; class 2, plants with height between 1 and 3 m; and Class 3, plants with a height greater than 3 m and DBH (diameter measured at breast height) less than 5 cm. In 2014, these individuals were re-evaluated, counting the dead and recruited individuals and classifying the survivors and recruits into the existing height classes. Rates of mortality, recruitment, net change, and height class changes were calculated. The data were analyzed by a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and contingency table. It was concluded that the species overcame the early stage of the invasion process, demonstrating great population growth in the study area. Also, a spatial partitioning between native and exotic species was observed, suggesting the existence of interspecific competition, the result of which may be the local extinction of species from the autochthonous group. © 2020, Universidade Federal de Santa Maria.

AB  - Tropical forests store large amounts of carbon and high biodiversity, but are being degraded at alarming rates. The emerging global Forest and Landscape Restoration (FLR) agenda seeks to limit global climate change by removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere through the growth of trees. In doing so, it may also protect biodiversity as a free cobenefit, which is vital given the massive shortfall in funding for biodiversity conservation. We investigated whether natural forest regeneration on abandoned pastureland offers such cobenefits, focusing for the first time on the recovery of taxonomic diversity (TD), phylogenetic diversity (PD) and functional diversity (FD) of trees, including the recovery of threatened and endemic species richness, within isolated secondary forest (SF) fragments. We focused on the globally threatened Brazilian Atlantic Forest, where commitments have been made to restore 1 million hectares under FLR. Three decades after land abandonment, regenerating forests had recovered ~20% (72 Mg/ha) of the above-ground carbon stocks of a primary forest (PF), with cattle pasture containing just 3% of stocks relative to PFs. Over this period, SF recovered ~76% of TD, 84% of PD and 96% of FD found within PFs. In addition, SFs had on average recovered 65% of threatened and ~30% of endemic species richness of primary Atlantic forest. Finally, we find positive relationships between carbon stock and tree diversity recovery. Our results emphasize that SF fragments offer cobenefits under FLR and other carbon-based payments for ecosystem service schemes (e.g. carbon enhancements under REDD+). They also indicate that even isolated patches of SF could help to mitigate climate change and the biodiversity extinction crisis by recovering species of high conservation concern and improving landscape connectivity. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - Background: This study aims to evaluate the technical feasibility of simple coppice system, in a planted stand of the native arboreal species Eremanthus erythropappus (DC.) MacLeish (candeia), according to different moments of soil scarification. The experiment is located in Baependi – MG (Brazil), where the mean altitude is 1,165 m and it´s under mild mesothermal climate. The first cycle was harvested under a clear-cutting system at 8 years after planting, with manual soil scarification and exposure of roots around the harvested trees stumps, at 5, 6, 7, and 8 weeks after cutting, i.e., four treatments with four repetitions of 50m2 plots each. In the first months, adventitious buds sprouting from the roots have been observed inside and outside the perimeter around stumps. The area remained fenced, without thinning or application of fertilizers and, until the third year, the selective clearing was done to eliminate weed competition. Six years after the treatment, measurements of diameter at 1.30 m height (DBH), the height of the sprouts, and the circumference at soil height (CSH) of stumps were taken. Results: After six years, the regenerated site under simple coppice system presented a density of established plants 216% higher than the harvested site using a high forest system (first cycle), but with only 4.3% of the commercial volume. The correlation between the density of sprouts and the density of stumps indicated that initial plant density can influence the number of sprouts after harvest. Conclusion: It was verified the simple coppice system feasibility and that scarification technique can be applied up to eight weeks after tree cutting. © 2021, Federal University of Lavras.

AB  - The mechanisms affecting forest regeneration in human-modified landscapes are attracting increasing attention as tropical forests have been recognized as key habitats for biodiversity conservation, provision of ecosystem services, and human well-being. Here we investigate the effect of the leaf-cutting ants (LCA) Atta opaciceps on regenerating plant assemblages in Caatinga dry forest. Our study encompassed 15 Atta opaciceps colonies located in landscape patches with a gradient of forest cover from 8.7% to 87.8%, where we monitored regenerating individuals (seedlings and saplings of woody and herbaceous plants) in different habitats (nests, foraging areas, and control areas) over one year. We recorded 2,977 regenerating plant individuals, distributed among 55 species from 23 families. Herbaceous plants represented 82.1% and 58.2% of the total number of individuals and species, respectively. Species richness of both the whole and herbaceous plant assemblages increased along the forest cover gradient, but without difference between the habitats. Total plant abundance was highest in control areas followed by foraging areas and nests and this pattern held for both woody and herbaceous plants. Although forest cover did not influence the abundance of herbaceous plants and the whole plant assemblage, it positively affects woody plant abundance across control areas. Forest cover and habitat changed species composition of both the entire regenerating and the herbaceous assemblages. These results together indicate that LCA negatively impact regenerating plant assemblages, particularly in those sites with increased forest cover. As LCA proliferate in human-modified landscapes, they may prevent plant regeneration of disturbed areas. © 2020 The Association for Tropical Biology and Conservation

AB  - Movement ecology is an important tool for understanding animal behaviour toward basic needs, as well as to design conservation and management priorities. Animals usually do not move randomly and may prefer certain types of habitats over others. The yellow anaconda (Eunectes notaeus) is one of the largest snakes in South America. However, little is known about its natural history. Here, we present results from a telemetry study to quantify movement patterns and habitat use of eight yellow anacondas in a protected, seasonally flooded area in Midwestern Brazil. Yellow anacondas were associated to small channels with macrophyte stands and bushy vegetation. They moved relatively little (188 m monthly) and had small home range (mean 6.2 ha); they used native pastures and abandoned farmlands with forest patches more than expected by chance. Our results contribute to the understanding of dispersal patterns, habitat choices, and life history of this large aquatic snake and to the body of knowledge needed for management and conservation of its populations and habitats. © 2020 Deutsche Gesellschaft für Herpetologie und Terrarienkunde.

AB  - Bryophytes play an important role in the process of ecological succession: conditioning the environment favourably for the emergence of subsequent groups. The objective of this study was to investigate the distribution of bryophyte communities in a cronossequence in the Caxiuanã National Forest, Pará, Brazil. To this end, biological material was collected in forest remnants with different successional stages based on regeneration age: Stage I (0 – 10 years), Stage II (10-25), Stage III (> 25) and Stage IV (primary forests). Density, richness and composition of species were compared between successional stages and the occurrence of possible indicator-species was investigated. The identified taxa were also classified by guilds of tolerance to solar radiation and colonized substrate. Composition of species was the variable that most contributed to understanding the distribution of bryophyte communities throughout successional stages, with eight species identified as potential indicators of some successional stages. Generalist species predominated in all stages. The richness of sun tolerants, in turn, decreased with the progress of succession, while shade tolerants increased. The land use history and land cover can influence the availability and quality of substrates and consequently their colonization by bryophytes in the different stages. © 2020, Academia Brasileira de Ciencias.

AB  - Through the variation of the functional attributes, it is possible to verify the functioning of an ecosystem, both by the species organization as by their responses to the environmental variations. In this sense, the objective of this study was to analyze the ecological strategies of the main tree species by analyzing their functional attributes. PCoA was used to verify which species are acquisitive and conservative; clustering was used to verify the functional attributes by groups; the Pearson’s correlation between the functional attributes and a CWM-RDA analysis was used to verify the environmental variables. Most species were classified as light-demanding climax and having zoochoric dispersion. The species presented phenotypic plasticity as an important ecological strategy in the composition of their functional attributes, especially when related to leaf area and specific leaf area. Most of the species belonged to the acquisitive group. The acquisitive and conservative groups indicate the resilience potential of the tree community and the change processes in ecological succession. There was a strong negative correlation between the leaf attributes, and a positive one with diameter and height, both correlations related to plant growth and development. Of the environmental variables only pH, K, and average elevation, were related to the attributes, indicating that environmental conditions are important for the establishment of the sampled species. Also, it was found that the species composition is linked to several conditions of ecological strategies associated with changes in the environment. © 2020, Sociedade de Investigacoes Florestais.

AB  - The aim of this study was to evalua te the influence of anthropogenic action and severe drought on the dynamics of forest cover in a fragment of caatinga in the semi-arid region of Brazil, over 32 years. To calculate the drought index, the values for weighted mean annual precipitation from a n historical series (1988-2019) were grouped into deciles. Based on the quantification of the area found in the classes of use and occupation (conserved forest cover, natural rural cover, anthropogenic area and water bodies) for the extreme dry and rainy years, multivariate statistical analysis was carried out using hierarchical cluster analysis. The mean values of the clusters were submitted to statistical analysis and compared by Student's t-test (p ≤ 0.05). Three distinct groups were found: G1, consisting of dry and very dry years from the 1990s; G2, formed by extreme wet and very wet years regardless of the period; and G3 (intermediate group), comprising both dry and rainy years, specifically from more recent periods (2000 to 2019). Groups G2 and G3 co ntributed the greatest amount of conserved forest cover, 143,176.50 and 144,928.13 ha respectively . The results show that rainfall is more closely correlated with the anthropogenic areas than with the natural regeneration of forest cover. The woody vegetat ion of the fragment under investigation has undergone a process of natural regeneration during the last decade (2008-2016), due to previously anthropogenic areas being abandoned in the 1990s. © 2021, Universidade Federal de Pernambuco.

AB  - Ecological succession is one of the most important processes in forest ecosystems, still poorly understood in the highland Araucaria forests of Southern Brazil. Here we investigated this process by describing functional composition changes in response to a vegetation successional mosaic in four forest fragments in the municipality of Urubici, State of Santa Catarina, Brazil. Two fragments were classified as in advanced stage of succession and two were classified in early stage. The following functional traits were determined: wood density, leaf area, specific leaf area, dispersal syndrome and leaf phenology. For each fragment, we determined the community weighted mean (CWM) and the functional diversity (RaoQ). Data were analyzed by descriptive statistics, t and Mann-Whitney tests and Principal Components Analysis. We found that the successional stage is a relevant source of functional heterogeneity. At the advanced-successional stage, tree communities have harder woods, more membranous and semi-deciduous leaves and higher functional diversity. Conversely, at the early successional stages, forests have softer wood, more coriaceous leaves and lower functional diversity. We concluded that the studied forests showed a high functional composition heterogeneity, partially determined by a successional mosaic. While perennial species with lower values of specific leaf area and wood density predominated in the early successional areas, semi-deciduous species with higher values of specific leaf area and wood density prevailed in the late successional ones. © 2021, Universidad Austral de Chile.

AB  - Rodents and marsupials together, form the most rich group of mammals in Brazil, they are distributed in all biomes, including Atlantic Forest, and can be used to analyze environmental quality. The Araucaria Forest is a threatened formation of the Atlantic forest with few areas remaining intact and a huge lack of knowledge about the potential of its secondary forest fragments to act as habitat refuges to native fauna. This study evaluated the species richness and diversity of non-volant small mammals among five vegetation types within a protected area in an Araucaria Forest area from southern Brazil. The sampling was made in six bimonthly campaigns during a year, by pitfall and live traps. This effort resulted in 875 captures of 625 individuals from 16 species. The most common species in Pine Plantation was Oligoryzomys nigripes, in Natural Regeneration forest was Thaptomys nigrita and Akodon montensis was most often captured in the other vegetation. Although differences in species composition were found among the different vegetation types, there was no significant difference in species richness. Nevertheless, true diversity values were significantly lower in the Pine Plantation. The results demonstrated that the substitution of native for exotic vegetation generated a negative impact on the group diversity. More studies, in other Araucaria Forest areas are necessary to allow better understanding of the processes driving this loss of diversity in this biome threatened by antropic action. © 2021, Fundacao Zoobotanica do Rio Grande do Sul.

AB  - Habitat loss is one of the main consequences of landscape transformation by humans. Monitoring biodiversity changes in areas under different management strategies is fundamental for species conservation. Our study is the first to assess the role of forest disturbance history on spider (Araneae) biodiversity in the westernmost portion of the Atlantic Forest. We analyzed taxonomic and functional aspects of spider assemblages in understories in a large forest fragment in southwestern Brazil. Spiders were sampled in five 30 m × 5 m plots over three seasons in three areas with different management histories: Clearcutting, selective logging, or native plots. We also characterized tree basal area, tree density, and canopy openness. The clear-cut plots showed more canopy openness and low habitat heterogeneity due to the high density of one pioneer native tree species. Forest structure in selective logging and native plots was similar. Spider richness, abundance, and functional richness were affected only by the season. Species composition also differed among the areas depending on the season. The abundance of web-building species was mainly associated with clear-cut areas in winter and spring. These results highlight the importance of natural regeneration in the Atlantic Forest after disturbance for the conservation of regional spider biodiversity. © 2020, Canadian Science Publishing.

AB  - We discriminated different successional forest stages, forest degradation, and land use classes in the Tapajós National Forest (TNF), located in the Central Brazilian Amazon. We used full polarimetric images from ALOS/PALSAR‐2 that have not yet been tested for land use and land cover (LULC) classification, neither for forest degradation classification in the TNF. Our specific objectives were: (1) to test the potential of ALOS/PALSAR‐2 full polarimetric images to discriminate LULC classes and forest degradation; (2) to determine the optimum subset of attributes to be used in LULC classification and forest degradation studies; and (3) to evaluate the performance of Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) supervised classifications to discriminate LULC classes and forest degradation. PALSAR‐2 images from 2015 and 2016 were processed to generate Radar Vegetation Index, Canopy Structure Index, Volume Scattering Index, Biomass Index, and Cloude– Pottier, van Zyl, Freeman–Durden, and Yamaguchi polarimetric decompositions. To determine the optimum subset, we used principal component analysis in order to select the best attributes to discriminate the LULC classes and forest degradation, which were classified by RF. Based on the variable importance score, we selected the four first attributes for 2015, alpha, anisotropy, volumetric scattering, and double‐bounce, and for 2016, entropy, anisotropy, surface scattering, and biomass index, subsequently classified by SVM. Individual backscattering indexes and polarimetric decompositions were also considered in both RF and SVM classifiers. Yamaguchi decomposition performed by RF presented the best results, with an overall accuracy (OA) of 76.9% and 83.3%, and Kappa index of 0.70 and 0.80 for 2015 and 2016, respectively. The optimum subset classified by RF showed an OA of 75.4% and 79.9%, and Kappa index of 0.68 and 0.76 for 2015 and 2016, respectively. RF exhibited superior performance in relation to SVM in both years.

AB  - Biological nitrogen fixation can be an important source of nitrogen in tropical forests that serve as a major CO2 sink. Extensive deforestation of the Amazon is known to influence microbial communities and the biogeochemical cycles they mediate. However, it is unknown how diazotrophs (nitrogen-fixing microorganisms) respond to deforestation and subsequent ecosystem conversion to agriculture, as well as whether they can recover in secondary forests that are established after agriculture is abandoned. To address these knowledge gaps, we combined a spatially explicit sampling approach with high-throughput sequencing of nifH genes. The main objectives were to assess the functional distance decay relationship of the diazotrophic bacterial community in a tropical forest ecosystem and to quantify the roles of various factors that drive the observed changes in the diazotrophic community structure. We observed an increase in local diazotrophic diversity (α-diversity) with a decrease in community turnover (β-diversity), associated with a shift in diazotrophic community structure as a result of the forest-topasture conversion. Both diazotrophic community turnover and structure showed signs of recovery in secondary forests. Changes in the diazotrophic community were primarily driven by the change in land use rather than differences in geochemical characteristics or geographic distances. The diazotroph communities in secondary forests resembled those in primary forests, suggesting that at least partial recovery of diazotrophs is possible following agricultural abandonment. IMPORTANCE The Amazon region is a major tropical forest region that is being deforested at an alarming rate to create space for cattle ranching and agriculture. Diazotrophs (nitrogen-fixing microorganisms) play an important role in supplying soil N for plant growth in tropical forests. It is unknown how diazotrophs respond to deforestation and whether they can recover in secondary forests that establish after agriculture is abandoned. Using high-throughput sequencing of nifH genes, we characterized the response of diazotrophs' β-diversity and identified major drivers of changes in diazotrophs from forest-to-pasture and pastureto- secondary-forest conversions. Studying the impact of land use change on diazotrophs is important for a better understanding of the impact of deforestation on tropical forest ecosystem functioning, and our results on the potential recovery of diazotrophs in secondary forests imply the possible restoration of ecosystem functions in secondary forests. © 2020 American Society for Microbiology.

AB  - The Caatinga (dryland) vegetation of northeastern Brazil has become highly anthropized while still poorly studied, with little research evaluating its potential for natural regeneration. This study sought to compare the compositions and structures of the shrub-arboreal components of two Caatinga areas with different histories of anthropic disturbance in the Negreiros National Forest, Pernambuco State, Brazil. Twelve 4 x 50 m plots were established in each area, sampling all individuals ≥ 1 m tall with stem diameters at ground level ≥ 3 cm. A total of 34 species were sampled. The two areas had very distinct structures, with different dominant species: Croton blanchetianus, Poincianella pyramidalis, and Croton sp. in the conserved area; and Cnidoscolus quercifolius and Aspidosperma pyrifolium in the anthropogenically impacted area. The presence of cattle grazing appears to be negatively interfering with the recuperation of the anthropized area, which continues as a phytophysiognomically open site more than 30 years after discontinuing agricultural activities. © 2020 Universidade Federal Rural do Rio de Janeiro (UFRRJ).

AB  - Many factors can influence the structures and distributions of plant communities. Plant diversity of swamp forests reflect responses to water stress conditions. We evaluated the floristic diversity, structure, and composition of the regenerating shrub-tree species of six swamp forests in veredas ecosystems (northern Minas Gerais, Brazil), and the floristic similarities between them. All individuals ≥ 1 cm in diameter at ground level and < 3 cm in diameter at breast height were sampled in one hundred 25 m2 plots in each area. A total of 5442 individuals were recorded, distributed among 134 species, 85 genera, and 47 botanical families, with a diversity (Shannon) of 3.38 and equability (Pielou) of 0.69. Beta diversity was high, while similarities between the areas were low, with only two species common to all six sites. The forests showed different compositions, diversities, and natural regeneration structures, reflecting their ecotone nature and past anthropic impacts. © 2020. All rights reserved.

AB  - We analyze here how much carbon is being accumulated annually by secondary tropical dry forests (TDFs) and how structure, composition, time since abandonment, and climate can influence the dynamics of forest carbon accumulation. The study was carried out in Santa Rosa National Park in Guanacaste province, Costa Rica and Mata Seca State Park in Minas Gerais, Brazil. Total carbon storage and carbon accumulation were obtained for both sites from the sum of the aboveground carbon and belowground carbon gain plus the annual litterfall. Carbon accumulation of these TDFs varied from 2.6 Mg C ha−1 y−1 to 6.3 Mg C ha−1 y−1, depending on the age of the forest stands. Time since abandonment and number of stems per plot were the best predictors for carbon storage, annual carbon gains, and losses. Mortality rates and carbon losses were also associated with seasonal climate variability. We found significant correlations between tree mortality, carbon losses and mean seasonal temperature, mean seasonal precipitation, potential evapotranspiration, and the Oceanic Niño Index. Carbon dynamics in tropical dry forests are driven by time since abandonment and forest structure; however, rising temperature and El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events can have a significant impact on tree mortality and carbon losses. Depending on their location and land-use history, some dry forests are more impacted by climatic extremes than others, and differences between secondary stages are expected. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Agricultural frontier expansion into the Amazon over the last four decades has created million hectares of fragmented forests. While many species undergo local extinctions within remaining forest patches, this may be compensated by native species from neighbouring open-habitat areas potentially invading these patches, particularly as forest habitats become increasingly degraded. Here, we examine the effects of habitat loss, fragmentation and degradation on small mammal assemblages in a southern Amazonian deforestation frontier, while accounting for species-specific degree of forest-dependency. We surveyed small mammals at three continuous forest sites and 19 forest patches of different sizes and degrees of isolation. We further sampled matrix habitats adjacent to forest patches, which allowed us to classify each species according to forest-dependency and generate a community-averaged forest-dependency index for each site. Based on 21,568 trap-nights, we recorded 970 small mammals representing 20 species: 12 forest-dependents, 5 matrix-tolerants and 3 open-habitat specialists. Across the gradient of forest patch size, small mammal assemblages failed to show the typical species-area relationship, but this relationship held true when either species abundance or composition was considered. Species composition was further mediated by community-averaged forest-dependency, so that smaller forest patches were occupied by a lower proportion of forest-dependent rodents and marsupials. Both species richness and abundance increased in less isolated fragments surrounded by structurally simplified matrix habitats (e.g. active or abandoned cattle pastures). While shorter distances between forest patches may favour small mammal abundances, forest area and matrix complexity dictated which species could persist within forest fragments according to their degree of forest-dependency. Small mammal local extinctions in small forest patches within Amazonian deforestation frontiers are therefore likely offset by the incursion of open-habitat species. To preclude the dominance of those species, and consequent losses of native species and associated ecosystem functions, management actions should limit or reduce areas dedicated to pasture, additionally maintaining more structurally complex matrix habitats across fragmented landscapes. © 2020 Palmeirim et al.

AB  - Restoration of degraded areas might be assessed via faunal communities of a particular region, and birds are one of the taxa most suitable in such assessments. This study evaluated the dynamics of a bird community in an area of Cerrado under natural regeneration, comparing it with one in the forest remnants. Birds were censused by a total of 24 point counts in both areas comprising 96 h of total sampling. Richness, abundance and diversity were greater at the regeneration area, possibly due to the heterogeneity of habitats, the consequent niche diversity, and the connectivity between patches of vegetation. Functional groups were also distinct between both sites, including species composition, feeding guilds and foraging strata. The regeneration site presented a higher abundance of omnivorous, granivorous and nectarivorous species, which might be related to the presence of sparser canopy, multiple opportunities for the development of grasses and forest-edge plants blooms in open areas. In contrast, higher abundance of invertebrate predators and frugivorous was found in the forested area, further confirming the relationship between those guilds and dense vegetation cover with closed canopies. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - There has been an increase in the area of secondary tropical forests in recent years due to forest restoration in degraded areas. Recent analyses suggest that the success of passive forest restoration is highly uncertain and needs to be better understood. This study aimed to investigate the behavior of saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ks) and some hydrophysical soil attributes between agricultural land uses, restored forests, and a degraded forest fragment. The areas evaluated are located in the municipality of Rio Claro, Sao Paulo, Brazil, under different types of land use: (i) two areas in the process of passive forest restoration: one of 18 and another of 42 years (NR18 and NR42); (ii) a degraded forest fragment (FFD); (iii) pasture (P), and (iv) sugarcane (SC). The hydraulic soil conductivity characterization was performed using the Beerkan method. Dry soil bulk density (BD), total porosity (Pt), macroporosity (Mac), microporosity (Mic), penetration resistance (PR), mean aggregate diameter (MWD), and soil organic carbon (OC) were also determined. The comparative analysis of the hydrophysical attributes of the soil superficial horizon in agricultural land uses (P and SC), restored forests (NR18 and NR42), and a degraded forest (DFF) confirms that the recovery of soil hydrological functioning in ongoing forest restoration processes can be a relatively slow process. In addition, the intensity of previous land use leaves footprints that can affect passive restoration areas for decades after agriculture abandonment, increasing the time for the recovery of Ks and soil hydrophysical attributes. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - The objective of the study was to evaluate the floristic and structural composition of an area located in a section of secondary Forest, in the municipality of Dona Francisca, RS state. To do so, 50 permanent plots with a dimension of 10 x 20 m (200 m²) were installed in a systematic way, 10 m apart and 40 m between tracks, totaling 1 ha. All individuals with CAP ≥ 15.7 cm were identified and sampled and the phytosociological estimators were calculated. The species accumulation curve was used to verify the sample adequacy. For the calculation of diversity and dominance estimators, the Shannon Index (H ‘) and Pielou Equability (J’) were used. Subsequently, the floristic and structural composition was evaluated through the Distributed Correspondence Analysis (DCA). It was also verified the diameter and histopic distribution of the tree community, and for the species, with importance value above 5%, the distribution in classes of DAP. Statistical analyzes were performed in the R program. 65 tree and shrub species were identified with 2,045 individuals distributed in 31 botanical families. The species with a value of importance above 5% were Casearia sylvestris (14, 04 %), Nectandra lanceolata (12, 86 %), Cupania vernalis (9, 57 %), Guarea macrophylla (7,29 %) and Ocotea puberula (5.07 %). The values ​for diversity and dominance were, respectively, 2.91 nats.ind-1 and 0.69, indicating that the area has low diversity and dominance of few species and that by DCA it is possible to verify that the plots are homogeneously distributed in the forest. The diameter distribution represented the expected behavior for the arboreal community with J-inverted tendency and the majority of the trees presented height concentrated in the middle stratum of the forest. Only Nectandra lanceolata and Ocotea puberula did not present negative exponential curve from the five species analyzed. It was possible to observe the mosaic of tree species distributed in the forest section. In addition, there is a predominance of individuals in the first classes of DBH and height, which characterizes the resilience of the area after the disturbance and its capacity for natural recovery. It also indicates the fluctuations and stability of species in ecological succession of a forest in an intermediate stage of regeneration. © 2021, Universidade Federal de Santa Maria.

AB  - This study aimed to evaluate the medium-term impacts of forest management on natural regeneration in central Amazon forest. The study was conducted in the logged forest belonging to Mil MadeirasPreciosas (Amazonas, Brazil). It was used data from continuous inventories that were carried out in 41 permanent parcels distributed in three Annual Production Units (APU), named APU B, C and D, logged in 1996, 1997 and 1998, respectively. In all units, forest inventories were carried out before logging and in the years 2001 and 2014; for APU B there was an additional inventory in 1998. The sample included trees with diameter at breast height between 5 cm and 14.9 cm. The species diversity analysis was performed by Shannon (H') and Pielou (J) indexes and the similarity analysis by Jaccard index and cluster analysis. The analyzes were made for all grouped species and commercial species group. A total of 8,090 trees families were sampled, distributed in 244 species and 48 families. Shannon index ranged from 3.77 to 4.08; Pielou index ranged from 0.74 to 0.84. There was a significant difference between H' for all species in two APUs 16 and 18 years after logging. There was significant difference between H' for commercial species before and 16 and 18 years after logging. Jaccard indexes ranged from 66.7% to 100%. The largest differences for the species composition were observed between pre-exploration inventories and the last measurement. Diversity and composition of species in the natural regeneration in the logged forest changed in a period by 16, 17 and 18 years after logging. © 2020, Universidade Federal de Santa Maria.

AB  - The understanding of the succession process is a fundamental condition in defining strategies for the conservation and sustainable use of forest ecosystems. Therefore, we aimed at testing which ecological factors affect short-term successional changes in the upper-montane forests of the “Planalto Sul Catarinense” Region, Brazil. We evaluated the influence of propagules source, soil seed bank, edaphic and topographic variables, nucleating elements and natural regeneration floristic-structural composition on demographic rates of tree-shrub regenerating component in three disturbed open vegetation areas at São Joaquim National Park. We inventoried the regenerative component in 2014, 2015 and 2016, within one 20x100 m transect in each area. Afterwards, demographic rates were determined for each period. The influence of explicative variables on demographic rates of the regenerating component was tested through the Generalized Least Square (GLS) model. We found an increment in both individuals and richness over time. When analyzing the influence of the explanatory variables on the speed of the successional process, we observed that only the floristic-structural composition of the natural regeneration was determinant. We conclude that the speed of the represented succession is, to a large extent, a feature related to the phase of the successional trajectory in which the vegetation is found. © 2021, Universidad Austral de Chile.

AB  - Passive restoration and applied nucleation are important strategies for large-scale gains and cost reduction in ecological restoration projects. Passive restoration uses the natural regeneration potential while applied nucleation recreates microhabitats, which facilitates ecological succession. In this study, we assessed floristic composition, structure and functional groups as ecological indicators to compare passive restoration (fenced site 12 year ago), applied nucleation (7 years of dense seedling planting) and riparian forest. The study was carried out in a Seasonal Semi-deciduous Forest region in the Pampa biome, in the South of Brazil. We measured and identified all shrub and tree individuals greater than 30 cm in height. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by the Tukey test (p <.05) was performed to compare composition (richness, abundance, diversity and evenness), structure (average height, maximum height, canopy cover, soil cover, leaf litter depth) and functional group variables (dispersion syndrome and shade tolerance). Riparian forest showed greater richness and diversity. Passive restoration and applied nucleation did not differ statistically in richness, abundance, maximum or average height, or for zoochoric species and zoochoric individual indicators. The leaf litter depth was statistically higher in the riparian forest. The applied nucleation presented a canopy cover similar to riparian forest, demonstrating ability to form habitats which are favorable to ecological succession. We can conclude that passive and applied nucleation restorations have been occurring in a slow process. This is the natural condition of the ecological succession in the Pampa biome, which is probably due to the subtropical climate. Although we could not verify the facilitation effect by functional groups in applied nucleation and expansion of the nuclei size, the floristic composition, diversity, canopy cover and leaf litter depth indicators suggest an acceleration in the ecological succession process. Long-term monitoring should be considered to assess the dynamics of ecological restoration in the subtropical region of Brazil. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The objective of this study was to select and discuss indices to explain competition among trees in an unmanaged stand in order to support decision-making in forest management. The work was carried out in a plantation of Araucaria angustifolia (Bertol.) Kuntze located in a national forest in southern Brazil. The plantation was established in 1946 in 2 × 2 m spacing, with only one thinning that happened sometime between 1970 and 1980. Forty-six sample plots were established using an adaptation of the Prodan method. We tested distance-independent and distance-dependent competition indices that included or excluded crown area variables. An equation was generated to describe the relation between diameter at breast height and crown diameter, since these were highly correlated (r = 0.87); this permitted calculation of the growth space required for the trees in the stand. It is important to carefully choose the variables and competition indices to be tested in each study case. Including crown variables did not improve prediction ability to overcome the performance of the Stage distance-independent index. In general, the distance-independent indices performed better than the distance-dependent ones, even the stand arrangement in our study area was modified through thinning, mortality, and natural regeneration. When the goal is to better understand the ecological significance of a competition index and not only its statistical ability to predict short-term growth, simpler indices are recommended. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Ecological succession depends on the seed rain. While the simple arrival of seeds is not assurance of establishment, knowing the seed rain is the first approach to assessing the succession process in sites undergoing forest restoration. For this reason, we sampled the seed rain in a restoration site and in an adjacent seasonal semi-deciduous forest remnant in southern Brazil, in order to describe the process. In each area, 18 seed traps (1 m2) were allocated and visited monthly for two years. All seeds trapped were identified, counted and classified by life form, ecological group and dispersal syndrome. The forest remnant presented higher species richness and abundance of propagules than the restoration site. The composition of species also differed between areas. The seed rain of both areas presented a higher proportion of tree and shade-intolerant species. Several non-planted species, possibly dispersed from forest remnant, were recorded in the restoration site. Analysis of the results suggests that the seed rain is not a constraint to succession in the restoration site. However, the site should be monitored in the long term to assess the establishment, and not only the arrival of seeds of late successional species. © 2020, Universidade Federal de Santa Maria.

AB  - The formerly wide-spread Araucaria angustifolia forests in S-Brazil have been cut during the whole of the 20th century and were converted into pastures, agricultural fields and forest plantations of pine and eucalyptus species. Araucarias only remained in small woodlots, groups or as single trees. Therefore, they were legally protected. The objectives of this study were to investigate the distribution of Araucaria seedlings in pine stands in order to consider whether Araucaria seedlings can be used for transforming pine plantations into mixed stands. Seedlings and saplings were detected in loblolly pine (Pinus taeda) plantations of a medium sized enterprise by means of a systematic large-scale inventory. Although the seedlings and saplings were heterogeneously distributed, they could be used for mixtures of up to one third of the area. The numbers of Araucaria seedlings and saplings were highly correlated with the distance to secondary forests containing old Araucarias as seed-bearing trees, with the age and also the number of thinnings of the sheltering pines. Nevertheless, the dataset was zero inflated, being the basal area of the pine stands a significant factor in this context. From the ecological point of view, it would be advisable to reconsider the strict Araucaria protection rules in order to encourage land owners to make use of the natural regrowth for mixtures with pines. However, this would also need a revision of the management standards for pine plantations, including longer rotation periods and early as well as intensive thinnings. © 2020 University of Sao Paolo.

AB  - Descriptions of individual breeding bird biologies provide important insights to our understanding of avian life history strategies. The present study focused on the reproductive biology and nesting ecology of the Olivaceous Flatbill (Rhynchocyclus olivaceus) in the Parque Zoobotânico (∼100 ha) of the Universidade Federal do Acre, Brazil, between April 2015 and March 2016. We found 91 nests, of which 14 were active and 77 were abandoned. Due to multiple nest failure incidents, we only monitored a single nest throughout the breeding period from nest construction to offspring fledging. This nest was built in 14 d, eggs were incubated for 26 d, and nestlings remained in the nest for additional 21 d. The nest was classified as closed, retort-shaped, and pensile. We deconstructed one nest that had a weight of 65 g composed of twigs (31.6% of the total weight), fibers (28.9%), leaves (14.5%), bark (9.2%), bamboo pieces (9.2%), and tendrils (6.6%). We found the nests at heights of 1-9 m above the ground, with a preference for a 2-4 m stratum, built atop 25 different plant species. The 4 species that were the most frequently used as nest substrate were Protium unifoliolatum (n = 16 nests), Casearia sp. (n = 11), Siparuna guianensis (n = 10), and Couepia sp. (n = 9). The Olivaceous Flatbill breeds throughout the year, in both rainy and dry seasons, and it seems to be highly sensitive to human disturbance during the breeding season. The reproductive parameters recorded in the present study were consistent with those reported for other species of this genus, although most of the findings are novel for the Olivaceous Flatbill and provide important insights into its reproductive biology in the Amazon region. © 2020 Wilson Ornithological Society.

AB  - Lauraceae family has one of the highest values of importance in the Mixed Ombrophilous Forest (MOF). The commercial value of some of its species was a reason for intense forest exploitation in the southern region of Brazil. Considering the hypothesis that it provides an essential subsidy for the constitution of this forest type, the aim of this study was to identify and quantify the influence of Lauraceae family in the dynamics of a 15.2 ha MOF remnant. Census data were collected every three years, since 2007, in which all trees with a circumference at 1.3 m height equal to or greater than 30 cm were identified and measured. Dynamics were analyzed by periodic increment in diameter, recruitment, and mortality through the measurement periods, while cluster multivariate analysis and canonical correlation were applied for grouping species and assessing their importance on the forest remnant dynamics. Diameter distribution prognosis of Lauraceae and its species was obtained through a transition matrix. Eleven tree species of Lauraceae family were identified, which showed decreasing diameter distribution and value of importance equals to 9.51%. Using cluster analysis, five groups were obtained, while the canonical correlation of 0.551 was considered moderate and statistically significant by Wilks’ Lambda test. By the projection of diameter distribution, it was verified that the study community is stable and self-regenerative. Although it is considered moderate, the influence of family on the forest remnant tends to increase with the advance of ecological succession. © 2021

AB  - The present research had as objective to evaluate the dynamics of the environmental recovery of waste dumps in calcary mining by analyzing the composition and phytosociological structure of natural regeneration. The study was carried out in a waste dumo located in Salto de Pirapora, São Paulo, Brazil, with sterile piles abandoned since 1994 and 2013 and a native forest fragment, totaling three treatments. Twelve plots of 10 × 10 m were allocated to each area, where all shrub-tree individuals with height above 1.30 m were sampled, identified and evaluated for their composition and phytosociological structure. The occurrence of natural regeneration in the sterile cells was observed with the increased number of individuals and species over time. The results indicate that the vegetation present in the waste dumps is in transition from pioneer forest to a more advanced successional stage. However, Leucaena leucocephala has established itself more expressively than other species, inhibiting the development of other species. Finally, management actions are suggested so that the ecological succession of the waste dumps is not compromised. © 2020 Associação Brasileira de Engenharia Sanitária e Ambiental.

AB  - The Brazilian savanna (Cerrado) has been extensively converted to croplands, pastures and forestry plantations, and the deforestation frontier continues expanding. Land conversion may cause critical changes in soil functioning, yet very little is still known about the impact of Cerrado conversion on nutrient cycling and soil fertility. Here, we addressed this knowledge gap by investigating the effects of the woodland cerrado (cerradão) conversion into pastures and Eucalyptus plantations on nitrogen availability and mineralization potential, considering a wide range of spatial and temporal variability due to soil depth, site conditions, and seasonal variation. For three sites in São Paulo state and each of the target land cover types, we assessed the total N and inorganic N (NH4-N and NO3-N) pools, potentially mineralizable nitrogen (PMN) and soil urease activity in the first 2 m of the soil profile. Cerrado conversion to either pastures or Eucalyptus plantations significantly reduced NH4-N, while NO3-N showed similar values in Cerrado and Eucalyptus and lower values in pastures. We found a consistent pattern of lower N mineralization in the uppermost soil layers associated to Cerrado conversion, with decreases in PMN rate and urease activity. The soil below 30 cm depth showed no relevant changes. Considering the first 30 cm of the soil profile, the reduction in the stocks of inorganic N (NH4-N + NO3-N) ranged from ~14% for the conversion to Eucalyptus to ∽20% for the conversion to pasture. The impact of land conversion on N cycling surpassed the influence of the spatial (between-site) and seasonal variation. Overall, the results indicate a decline in available N and overall soil fertility due to Cerrado conversion, which could further increase N limitation in the Cerrado region, increase fertilization needs for future exploitation, and compromise the recovery of Cerrado in case of land abandonment or restoration. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This study analyzed natural regeneration floristic patterns in spring habitats submitted to different ecological restoration actions in the seasonal forest in Atlantic Forest biome, Rio Grande do Sul. We assessed floristic composition in six springs before restoration actions and 12 months later. We identified and counted all regenerating individuals with height greater than or equal to 30 cm and diameter at breast height less than or equal to 5 cm in eight plots in each spring. The richness and abundance of each spring and assessment were compared by the Kruskal-Wallis test (P<0.05). Detrended Correspondence Analysis (DCA) was performed to verify floristic patterns and association between species. Results showed an increase in richness and abundance after ecological restoration implementation. The DCA showed a distinct floristic composition between springs. The springs remaining natural vegetation and the successional stage of these vegetation influenced the natural regeneration floristic composition pattern. Passive restoration, which was effective by enclosure, favored natural regeneration recruitment. © 2021, Universidade Federal de Santa Maria. All rights reserved.

AB  - Understanding the factors that influence the composition and structure of bee communities in natural habitats is critical for conservation and restoration efforts, mainly in disturbed ecosystems that are widely used for agricultural crop production, such as tropical dry forests (TDF). The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of tree species composition and vegetation structure on the composition, abundance and species richness of eusocial and non-eusocial wild bee assemblages. Bees (19.909 individuals of 96 species) were collected in fifteen plots in different secondary succession stages in a TDF in the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil. We found a positive relationship between tree community similarity and bee community similarity, for both eusocial and non-eusocial bees. Average tree height positively affected the abundance and species richness of eusocial bees, while the abundance of non-eusocial bees was negatively affected by tree species richness. Similar tree species composition and vegetation structure between plots at the same stage of secondary succession probably determined more similar bee communities than dissimilar tree communities. Most eusocial bee species are dependent on cavities in large trees to house their colonies, while most non-eusocial bees probably prefer open habitats because they provide a greater density and diversity of floral resources, and suitable areas for ground-nesting species. Since eusocial bees represented 94% of the individuals sampled, the conservation and restoration of mature forests is of primary importance in order to increase eusocial bee diversity, and the maintenance of these areas in the vicinity of agricultural systems is crucial to increase the ecosystem service of pollination. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Mining contributes significantly to the world's economy. However, it brings strong environmental impacts, including the destruction of the original vegetation. In this way, the recovery of degraded areas by mining has been a mandatory procedure in many countries. With the objective to review this subject, a bibliometric analysis was carried out using scientific articles published in the period 1990–2018. A total of 700 articles in 171 journals were sampled. Ecological Engineering and Restoration Ecology were the journals with the largest number of articles. There was a significant increase of articles along time approaching the use of geotechnologies and arbuscular fungi. Recovered or recovering ecosystems were studied in 45 countries, mainly in Brazil, Australia, USA, China, and Spain. Coal and bauxite were the most common resources mined. The most frequent recovery methods were: seedling planting, direct seeding, natural regeneration, and hydroseeding, with techniques employed in some of them. In 35.71% of the articles, a small number of species (2–5) were used for the initial plant's establishment. The number of articles decreased as the number of both, plant species used in the initial recovery phase, and ecosystem's age increased. In monitoring, the most important indicators were classified as functional or functional plus structural. From the functional indicators, the Technosols or rebuilt soils were the most evaluated. Future perspectives on forests recovery includes methods tailored to peculiar features (soil and economic) of each ecosystem. For the forest recovery monitoring, the use of geotechnologies, mainly the Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), as well as wildlife indicators tend to increase rapidly. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The concept of “naturalness” can be associated with conservation status, resilience, and biodiversity. Its most common definition relates to the degree to which a resource is similar to its original state. Hence, we developed a naturalness assessment method for the Brazilian Araucaria forest. We used data collected within 145 systematically distributed plots over an area of ~56 000 km2. We selected five indicators to compose a unified naturalness index: (i) evidence of human activities inside the forest stand; (ii) abundance of naturalness-indicator species; (iii) standard deviation of diameter at breast height (Sdbh); (iv) species diversity of the understory–natural regeneration layer; and (v) forest stand landscape metrics. We then calculated the Euclidean distance between the vector generated from the indicators of an ordinary forest stand and the vector generated from a theoretical reference forest (TRF) with maximum naturalness. The reduced Sdbh reflected the stands’ diminished structural diversity as result of historical logging and other ongoing human activities. Most stands presented average naturalness compared with the TRF. Besides the lack of data on undisturbed forests to thoroughly evaluate the naturalness index, evidence suggested that it summarized relevant forest attributes to the extent that protected areas presented greater naturalness than nonprotected areas. © 2020, Canadian Science Publishing.

AB  - When an area previously used for agricultural or sylvicultural purposes is abandoned, it may undergo natural regeneration. However, the outcome of such regeneration depends on a number of factors, including the presence of non-native invasive plants, and, when production forests such as eucalypt plantations are considered, remaining non-native trees may also affect the natural regeneration possibilities. We studied how remaining eucalypt trees affect woody species regeneration and invasive grasses in an abandoned Eucalyptus grandis plantation in a regenerating Brazilian savanna site. We sampled the woody vegetation and invasive grasses in 30 8 × 8-m plots and surveyed the eucalypt trees within these plots and in 3 m-wide strips around them. Eucalypts negatively affected the cover of the C4 invasive African grass Melinis minutiflora and the total abundance and basal area of native woody plants in general and of two dominant species, suggesting an overall negative effect on native plant regeneration notwithstanding the also negative effects on African grasses. Conversely, they had no effect on species richness, species diversity nor mean height of woody plant communities nor on the abundance of three other dominant native woody species. Interestingly, a low eucalypt abundance had small effects on native woody species but much stronger effects on the cover of M. minutiflora, possibly due to shading. Thus, our results indicate that remaining eucalypt trees may hamper the natural regeneration of native woody plants, but also suggest that maintaining a low density of eucalypt trees may be a cost-effective strategy, given the high costs associated with the complete removal of remaining trees and the difficulties in controlling invasions by African grasses. © 2020 Elsevier Masson SAS

AB  - The aims of this study were to investigate the intrapopulation spatial genetic structure (SGS) of a preserved Swietenia macrophylla population in a managed forest in Southwestern Amazon, in Acre state, Brazil, and assess the genetic parameters that underlie the conceptual framework that guides conservation and management strategies. The study was conducted in Annual Production Unit (APU) 3, where 83 adult trees (DBH ≥ 40 cm) were mapped (1650 ha). The diameter at breast height (DBH) was measured and the vascular exchange was sampled. Leaf tissues were collected from 187 juvenile individuals within a radius of 20 m of adults. The population presented high heterozygosity (Ho) for adult (0.767) and juvenile (0.763) individuals, but significantly high allelic richness (R) and significantly lower fixation index (F) in adults (R = 10.3, F = 0.048) than juveniles (R = 9.3, F= 0.119). The F value significantly higher for juveniles, suggesting selection against inbred individuals between juvenile and adult life stages. SGS was detected for adults up to 300 m. Mating was mainly through outcrossing (0.97–1.0), but some crossing occurred among related trees (0.02–0.16) and were correlated (rpm = 0.06–0.22), indicating a mean effective number of pollen donors ranging from 4.5 to 18.2. Pollen dispersal distances reached 3905 m (mean of 1472 m), and mean effective pollination neighbor area of 792 ha. The effective population size (Ne) within family (2.73) was lower than expected for random mating populations. The number of trees (m) required for seed collection was estimated at 55 non-inbreed and not related trees to each other. The core collection consisted of 42 (50.6%) adults across the area. These individuals should be included in seed collection as they represent 100% of the total detected genetic diversity. The inclusion of S. macrophylla on the list of species available for exploitation is not indicated, because the species requires cross breeding for its maintenance and logging reduce the Ne and may negatively impact the pattern of genetic diversity. These will significantly increase the risk of genetic erosion and population extinction due to a lack of adaptive ability. Adults serve as pollen donors that ecologically and genetically contribute to the maintenance of gene flow and Ne. Because it is recognized as a threatened species worldwide, and due to the fact that in areas of natural occurrence the species presents low-density and shows difficulty establishing natural regeneration, we recommend that S. macrophylla be protected from selective logging. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Forest restoration is a strategy to reverse forest loss and degradation. We overviewed deforestation in the period 1975–2018 in the Brazilian Amazon and the projects, techniques, and scientific publications conducted to recover forest in the area by 2019. We used GIS to assess forest loss and a systematic data collection gathered from 12 universities, five major environmental agencies, and an ad-hoc bibliographic survey that rendered information from 405 restoration projects and 152 published studies. The Brazilian Amazon has undergone an accelerated deforestation in the last 43 years, resulting in 20% (788,353 km2) of its territory deforested by 2018. Deforestation rate was 27,033 km2 yr−1 between 1975 and 1987 and 14,542 km2 yr−1 between 1988 and 2018 (1.97% yr−1 of forest loss between 1975 and 2018). In 2018, 41 Amazonian municipalities were classified as priority areas for monitoring and control deforestation and 21 additional municipalities were deemed as areas with controlled deforestation. Our survey identified 405 projects of forest restoration in 191 municipalities between 1950 and 2017. The majority (229) of these projects used seedling planting as the main forest restoration technique. Forest restoration projects based upon agroforestry systems (144), assisted natural regeneration (27), and natural regeneration (5) were also identified. Despite a considerable number of projects and publications, the region still lacks scientific studies that reinforce the choice of best practices for forest restoration, and the information currently available is not enough to quantify what has already been recovered or the potential area to be restored. © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - Sturnira lilium is a frugivorous bat that is known for its high consumption of Solanaceae fruits. We captured S. lilium, using mistnets, to study its diet and diet seasonal variation in a seasonal deciduous forest in southern Brazil. We also investigated the predominance of Solanaceae and of Solanum granulosoleprosum, the main food source, correlated with the availability of ripe fruits. A total of 11 plant species were identified from 126 fecal samples. Seeds of Solanaceae species were present in 81% of the samples, with S. granulosoleprosum seeds being the most common (68.3 %). There was no seasonal variation in the diet; however ANOVA revealed that the consumption of Solanaceae and S. granulosoleprosum showed monthly differences. There was no monthly correlation and there was a weak seasonal correlation between ripe fruit availability and the consumption of S. granulosoleprosum by S. lilium, indicating that this bat species occupies broad home ranges and is capable of locating plants with mature fruits in adjacent areas during most of the year. The mobility of S. lilium and high abundance of S. granulosoleprosum in the diet suggests that this species as good disperser of plants that are characteristic of early successional stages and areas undergoing regeneration. © 2021, Academia Brasileira de Ciencias.

AB  - Secondary forests (SFs) are one of the major carbons sinks in the Neotropics due to the rapid carbon assimilation in their above-ground biomass (AGB). However, the accurate contribution of SFs to the carbon cycle is a great challenge because of the uncertainty in AGB estimates. In this context, the main objective of this study is to explore full polarimetric Advanced Land Observing Satellite/Phased Array L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar-2 (ALOS/PALSAR-2) data to model SFs AGB in the Central Amazon. We carried out the forest inventory in 2014, measuring 23 field plots. Supplementary land-use classification history was used to create 120 additional independent sample plots by adjusting growth curves using SFs age and previous land-use intensity from field plots and literature database. Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) analysis was performed to select the best model by corrected weighted Akaike Information Criterion (AICw) and validated by the leave-one-out bootstrapping method. The best-fitted model has six parameters and explained 65% of the above-ground biomass variability. The prediction error was of Root Mean Square Error of the Prediction (RMSEP) = 8.8 ± 3.0 tonnes ha−1 (8.8%). The most explanatory variables for modelling secondary forest AGB were those that result from multiple scattering (Shannon Entropy), volumetric scattering (Bhattacharya decomposition), and double-bounce scattering (ratio VV/HH, vertically transmitted and received polarization/horizontally transmitted and received polarization). Including past-use of SF areas in the model with the Landsat time series classification, as the frequency of clear cuts and the number of years of active land-use before abandonment, the MLR has increased by 10%, achieving 71% of the variability explained by the model. The uncertainty report showed that ground truth AGB estimation (inventory, allometry, and plot expansion factors) might represent 50% of the errors in the modelling estimation. In contrast, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) inversion models (SAR error and regression) have achieved 20%. The results showed that additional information on secondary forest land-use history could improve the performance of AGB recovery models, as well as can be used to expand the sampling units on tropical forests. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Knowing which restoration approach provides the best returns on investment for accumulating carbon is essential to foster restoration planning, financing, and implementation. Here, we explored the cost-effectiveness and drivers of aboveground and soil carbon accumulation in restored forests across an agricultural landscape of Brazil's Atlantic Forest. The recovery of aboveground and soil carbon stocks, as well as the implementation and land opportunity costs, was assessed across chronosequences (10–60 years) of second-growth forests and mixed-species tree plantings and old growth, reference forest remnants. Plantations accumulated approximately 50% more aboveground carbon than second-growth forests throughout the chronosequence. When controlling for soil clay content, soil carbon stocks were higher in reference than in restored forests, but they were comparable between plantations and second-growth forests. After 60 years of stand development, recovery of total carbon stocks in both restoration approaches reached only half of the average stocks of reference forests. Total cost-effectiveness for carbon accumulation, including both implementation and land opportunity costs, was on average 60% higher for second-growth forests than for plantations (15.1 and 9.4 kgC US$−1, respectively). Although tree plantations initially showed higher rates of carbon storage than second-growth forests, their higher implementation and land opportunity costs make them less cost-effective for carbon farming. Our results further suggest that, at current pricing levels, carbon markets alone have a limited potential to up-scale restoration efforts in Brazil's Atlantic Forest. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Comparative studies between different strata of forests in ecological succession are important to understand the forest dynamics. The study evaluated floristic, phytosociological and ecological aspects between the tree and regenerating strata of an urban fragment of semideciduous forest, in Jataí, Goiás state. In the last decades, the vegetation that was typically savanna has become a forest. Trees (diameter at breast height, DBH ≥ 5 cm) were sampled in 12 permanent 200m² plots. In each of them, 25m² sub-plots were sampled for the regenerant stratum, which comprised individuals with DBH <5cm and height ≥ 1m. Regenerants had greater richness (31 species), with two more species than adults. There was low floristic and structural similarity between the strata, indicating a replacement of species over time. Shannon’s diversity was significantly lower for the tree stratum (t test), since it presented low equability, with ecological dominance of few species. Both strata had a high proportion of pioneer species, when compared to other studies. Zoochory and species of forest environments were significantly more abundant in the regenerating stratum. The study revealed a fragment in a frank process of secondary succession and vulnerability in the face of anthropic pressures, with care regarding its conservation being important. © 2021, Universidade Federal de Santa Maria.

AB  - Questions: Community assembly in regenerating forests is a key topic in ecology. Most studies examine the assembly process, assessing adult individuals along the forest succession. Although the adult stage is the final outcome of the assembly process, both abiotic and biotic filters can affect community assembly during early ontogenetic stages. Here, we investigate whether the functional composition and trait assembly patterns (trait convergence or divergence) change across ontogenetic stages along regenerating forest stands exposed to precipitation and chronic anthropogenic disturbance (CAD) gradients. Location: Caatinga dry forest, Catimbau National Park, Pernambuco, Brazil. Methods: Seeds (rain and bank), seedlings and adults of woody plant species were recorded across 15 forest regenerating stands (4–70 years since land abandonment) exposed to precipitation and CAD gradients. Seven functional traits related to species dispersal, establishment and resource use were measured for adult individuals and used to calculate the trait values for seeds and seedlings. Twenty old-growth forest stands were used as a regional flora. Results: Functional composition (community weighted mean, CWM) varied across ontogenetic stages as wood density increased from seeds to seedlings, while seed mass increased from seeds to both seedlings and adults. The CWM also varied along precipitation/disturbance gradients but not along forest regeneration regardless the ontogenetic stage. Among seeds, dispersal distance increased towards wetter forest stands and decreased towards disturbed sites, while adult wood density increased from drier to wetter regenerating forest stands. Traits converged along the precipitation gradient but not in response to time since land abandonment. Conclusions: Caatinga dry forest regeneration is functionally structured across ontogenetic stages mediated mostly by water availability, but not over time since land abandonment. The effect of water availability on forest regeneration across ontogenetic stages highlights the complexity of species assembly in human modified landscapes, imposing important consequences considering the expected increasing aridity in the Caatinga. © 2020 International Association for Vegetation Science

AB  - The conversion of forests to agricultural crops impacts these ecosystems, causing negative changes in the biological, physical and chemical soil attributes. Agroforestry systems (AFs) represent an environmental sustainable alternative that can bind healthy food production and nature conservation. Litter production and decomposition are key roles to carbon and nutrient cycles in the tropics, as the main sources of nutrients for plant growing. The aim of this study was to quantify the amount of leaf litter accumulated aboveground and its contribution to nutrient return through decomposition process in 5- and 10-year multistrata successional agroforestry systems (AF5 and AF10) as compared to 10-year natural regeneration areas (NR10) at Brazilian Atlantic Rainforest Biome. Greater amounts of standing litter were observed on AF5 (61 Mg ha−1) as compared to AF10 (45 Mg ha−1) and NR10 (39 Mg ha−1), with leaf contribution of 17% (AF5), 25% (NR10) and 30% (AF10). Leaf decomposition was performed using litterbags, and all curves were fitted to a double exponential model for remaining mass, C and Mg and to a single exponential model for N, P, K and Ca. The half-time life of decomposing leaves varied from 173 days (NR10) to 289 (AF5) and 301 days (AF10), and the half-time mineralization of nutrients varied from 15 (N on AF5) to 257 days (K on AF10). Despite their low contribution on total standing litter, leaf fraction is able to return at least 100 kg ha−1 N, 5 kg ha−1 P and 10 kg ha−1 K to soil of multistrata agroforestry systems, reducing NPK external inputs dependence to small farmers. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - The Fundão Dam breach, in November 2015 in Mariana (20º 22ʹ 40″ S, 43º 24ʹ 58″ W), was considered, at that time, the largest environmental disaster in Brazilian history. Meliponiculture was one of the activities pointed out as a way to promote floristic recovery and to generate income for the population, in order to minimise the impact of the disaster. The objective of this work was to identify the plants supplying pollen and nectar for Tetragonisca angustula by means of melissopalynological analysis in areas under the influence of the Fundão Dam breach. The palynological data were evaluated comparing to the floristic survey carried out in the region and using multivariate statistical analysis to verify the pollen similarities between the study sites and to investigate possible impacts caused on the bee flora due to the disaster. The pollen spectra of honey did not show differences among the study sites, since Schinus terebinthifolius Raddi predominated in all samples. Regarding the bee bread, two distinct groups were formed; in the areas affected by the dam breach there was a predominance of pollen from the pioneer heliophytic species of herbaceous or shrub habit such as Baccharis, Crotalaria and Mimosa pudica. In the non-affected areas pollen of Cecropia, Myrsine and Schinus predominated, demonstrating a more established environment in the ecological succession. It is suggested that the results obtained be considered in the restoration projects in the region to assist the development of stingless bee-keeping projects as a tool for environmental recovery. © 2020, © 2020 Collegium Palynologicum Scandinavicum.

AB  - The Guamá River basin, in the northeastern state of Pará, eastern Amazon, Brazil, encompasses approximately 1,200,000 hectares. It presents great economic and social importance and is under significantly changes in land use and land cover. The objective of this work was to analyze and characterize the landscape structure of this basin through landscape ecology indexes (density, size, metric variability, shape, core area, proximity indexes, and patch area index). Land use and land cover maps were developed using images from the RapidEye system through supervised digital classification. The vegetation and landscape structure were quantified in patches, classes, and land cover. The forest patches were associated with partial conservation of some areas where production sectors had not yet directly affected, or those from natural regeneration of abandoned areas, mainly pastures. The class vegetated area was the second class most representative of the Guamá River basin covered about 37% considering the total area. The basin landscape presented more than 34,000 vegetated area patches It showing that this class are very fragmented by the presence of a large number of small patches, with this the basin landscape is compromised regarding its ecological integrity, since more than half of its forest patches are in edge environments. The indexes enabled a good joint analysis of the sub-basins of the Guamá River basin, resulting in a more detailed overview of the forest fragmentation process. © 2021, Russian Geographical Society.

AB  - Secondary forest succession can be an effective and low-cost strategy to increase forest cover and the associated biodiversity and soil functions. However, little is known about how soil functions develop during succession, and how vegetation attributes influence soil functions, especially in highly biodiverse and fragmented landscapes in the tropics. Here we assessed a wide range of indicators of taxonomic (e.g. number of tree species), structural (e.g. basal area, canopy openness) and functional diversity (e.g. community weighted means of functional traits) of tree species, as well as indicators for soil functions related to soil organic matter accumulation, nutrient cycling and soil cover in secondary forest patches ranging from 5 to 80 years. Two recently abandoned agricultural fields were included as the starting point of forest succession and two primary forest patches served as references for the end point of forest succession. Four ecological hypotheses, centred around the role of functional diversity, structural diversity and biomass, were tested to explore mechanisms in which forest vegetation may influence soil functions. Most measures of structural, taxonomic and functional diversity converged to values found in primary forests after 25–50 years of succession, whereas functional composition changed from acquisitive to conservative species. Soil carbon and nutrient cycling showed a quick recovery to the levels of primary forests after 15 years of succession. Although soil cover also increased during succession, levels of primary forests were not reached within 80 years. Variation in tree height and trait dominance were identified as aboveground drivers of carbon and nutrient cycling, while aboveground biomass was the main driver of litter accumulation, and the associated soil cover and water retention. Our results indicate that secondary forest succession can lead to a relative fast recovery of nutrient and carbon cycling functions, but not of soil cover. Our findings highlight the essential role of secondary forests in providing multiple ecosystem services. These results can be used to inform management and reforestation programmes targeted at strengthening soil functions, such as soil cover, nutrient and carbon cycling. © 2019 The Authors

AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the identification and floristic composition of seedlings of tree species, located in the soil seed bank of a remnant of the Dense Ombrophilous Forest of the Lowlands, in the Northeast of Brazil, from a morphofunctional ecology standpoint. A hundred and fifty two soil samples (0.2 m x 0.15 m x 0.05 m) were taken from a forest remnant, stored in polyethylene bags, identified and then taken to the Forest Nursery at the Federal Rural University of Pernambuco, where they were placed in polyethylene boxes under a 70% shade cloth and evaluated daily for a period of seven months. The seedlings emerged were photographed, separated into morphospecies, identified at the family and gender level and, when possible, at the species level. The density and absolute frequency, as well as the successional and morphological classification of the seedling cotyledons were estimated. In total, 1,577 seedlings of 31 morphospecies were cataloged. Melastomataceae was the family that presented the greatest richness, representing 48% of the species identified. The average density was 344.62 seeds.m-2, with higher densities for species of the family Melastomataceae, together with Maprounea guianensis and Cecropia palmata. There was a predominance of seedlings with epigeal and phanerocotylar germination, and with foliaceous cotyledons, corresponding to 93.56%. The seed bank was composed, predominantly, by pioneer species such as Cecropia palmata, Henriettea succosa, Miconia hypoleuca and Miconia tomentosa. Seedlings with epigeal germination, foliaceous and phanerocotylar cotyledons predominated for being easily established in more open areas. © 2021. Floresta. All Rights Reserved.

AB  - This study evaluated changes in the structure for remnant Mixed Ombrophilous Forest recovering from logging, which ceased over 40 years ago. Regarding the dynamics of the floristic composition of natural regeneration, 18 species remained (23.38% of the total) and 27 new species entered (35.06% of the total). The greatest increases were observed for Allophylus edulis, Myrsine umbellata, and Miconia cinerascens. When analyzing the dynamics of regeneration in ecological groups, it was observed that pioneer species had a similar value in both surveys (29.4% and 29.6%); secondary species decreased from 56.6% to 52.8%, and late-successional species increased from 0.2% to 6.0%. Therefore, the forest fragment studied is in a healing phase after disturbance, characterized by the increased regeneration of pioneer species as a result of sufficient light entering the interior of the forest. © 2021, Institute for Environmental Research in Hydrographic Basins (IPABHi).

AB  - This paper presents a simulation of the regulation of Araucaria angustifolia (Bertol.) Kuntze timber stocks using Liocourt's law. Although this species is currently protected by law, recent government initiatives are being considered to propose sustainable forest management practices by selecting small rural properties in Southern Brazil. Here, we simulate the applicability of Liocourt's law in a typical rural property, the size of which is approximately 85 ha. Forest inventory measurements were conducted by estimating the diameter at the breast height (d), total height (h), and annual diameter increments of 308 trees that fit the criteria of d ≥ 10 cm, distributed on 35 permanent plots of 400 m2 each. As a result, a reverse J-shaped d distribution was found. On average, 303 trees can be found per hectare (ha). Local allometric equations showed their basal area (G) to be 21.9 m2. ha-1, and their commercial volume (V) to be 172 m3. ha-1, whereas Liocourt's quotient (q) was 1.31. Based on these attributes, nine different forest management scenarios were proposed by simulating a remaining basal area (Grem) of 10.0, 14.0, and 18.0 m2ha-1, and Liocourt's quotient was changed to 1.1, 1.3, and 1.5. All scenarios consider a d of 62.5 cm. In the less intensive scenario (i.e., q value = 1.5 and larger basal area of 18.0 m2. ha-1) there is greater optimization of space, and higher economic return is ensured to rural producers due to the definition of shorter cutting cycles. This also allows a faster growth rate in both d and h for smaller trees, due to the higher incidence of light onto the lower canopy layer, increasing the natural regeneration implementation of other native species. Forest management should thus be considered a goal in addition to consumer market characteristics for defining the ideal timber stock scenario. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Illegal deforestation in the amazon region has been growing a lot in recent years, the biggest and most worrying advances are within Conservation Units (CUs). This research aims to evaluate the efficiency of three Private Natural Heritage Reserve (RPPN) for the conservation of the forest cover. Therefore, for this research, three RPPNs (Seringal Assunção, Vale das Antas and Água Boa) were monitored using the supervised classification of images Landsat 5 and 8, corresponding to the years of creation of each RPPN and 2018. To perform the classification were collected ~60 pixels per area of interest (ROI), the classes selected were water, exposed soil and forest. After monitoring the three RPPNs, it was possible to observe an increase between 2% up to 35% of forest cover in the RPPNs. With the monitoring of the RPPNs using the images Landsat it was possible to detect the efficiency of the natural regeneration of the forest cover, as well as the preservation of the native vegetation. Therefore, it is possible to conclude that RPPNs are efficient to contain deforestation. However, further research is still needed in this area, since there are few researches on the monitoring of conservation units in Rondnia as well as in Brazil. © 2020 Federal University of Mato Grosso.

AB  - Secondary forests emerging during traditional shifting cultivation practices are increasingly recognized for their fulfillment of ecosystem services and mitigation potential of climate change and biodiversity losses. The soil seed bank as a recruit reservoir is a limiting factor for natural forest regeneration of such secondary forests and is decisive for the formation and restitution of the post-disturbance community. The aim of this study was to compare the composition of the soil seed bank along a natural regeneration chronosequence from the Caxiuanã National Forest, eastern Amazon, including old-growth reference sites. We sampled standing vegetation, soil properties and soil seed banks and compared the density and species richness of different life forms among different regeneration stages. Using nonmetric, multiple scaling, we compared the composition of the soil seed bank among different regeneration stages and with standing vegetation composition. Furthermore, we outlined the influence of stand age, vegetation structure and soil properties on the density, richness and functional characterization of the soil seed bank using mixed effect models. The soil seed bank was dominated by herb seeds in all regeneration stages, and the density and richness of tree seeds increased with regeneration time and recovery of vegetation structure. Seed bank composition changed gradually with regeneration advance and differed from standing vegetation, containing a high amount of allochthonous seeds, especially in older stands. This observation highlights the importance of dispersal and habitat connectivity for the natural regeneration of these secondary forests. Shifts in soil seed bank composition towards slow-growing, animal-dispersed, non-pioneer species with larger, recalcitrant seeds in older regeneration stands indicate changes in vegetation composition along succession. Thus, our data indicate the importance of connectivity for forest regeneration and long fallow periods (> 40 years) to increase the performance of ecosystem services, resilience and stability of secondary forests arising during shifting cultivation practices. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In Brazil, many pastures are formed by grasses of the genus Urochloa, which have recognized inhibitory effects on regeneration of native vegetation. Using facilitation practices for natural regeneration of these areas aims to promote forest restoration by creating safe sites in the seedbed. This study aimed to assess the efficiency of brushwood and artificial perch as techniques to improve native plant establishment in an area covered by the inhibitory grasses of Urochloa. Field work was conducted between February 2014 and February 2016, in an area of lowland Atlantic rainforest in Morretes-PR. A set of 12 8 m × 5 m plots were established, corresponding to three treatments and four replicates, organized according to randomized block and split-plot design. The treatments were: brushwood, brushwood + artificial perch and control treatment. Evaluations were conducted at 4, 8, 12, 18 and 24 months after the experiment was installed by counting and identifying regenerating woody species and visually estimating cover percentage of herbs and subshrubs species. Brushwood treatments with and without perch initially reduced Urochloa grasses; however, over time the initial effects ceased due to the rapid growth of grass at plot edges. Likewise, perches in this treatment did not increase native/woody species. We concluded that the ecological restoration of Urochloa pastures requires additional measures to control grasses and increase local resilience in order to improve the seedbed. © 2020, Botanical Society of Sao Paulo.

AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the capacity as bioindicators of litter arthropodofauna in pasture restoration in the Atlantic Forest Biome. Areas of native forest under natural regeneration, and pastures treated with different ecological restoration techniques were evaluated, with pitfall traps. The sampling period was from April/2017 to October/2018, bimonthly. Families Ptiliidae, Staphylinidae, and Leiodidae, species Pheidole cf. sarcina (Formicidae) and Mastigoceras sp. 1 and Szeptyckitheca sp. 1 (Collembola) were indicators of well-conserved areas, whereas families Cicadellidae and Delphacidae, Formicidae species Wasmannia auropunctata (Roger, 1863) and Camponotus melanoticus Emery, 1894 were indicators of degraded areas. From the springtail community, species richness is a metric that can be used as a bioindicator. It was observed that all taxonomic identification levels allowed for the differentiation of the environmental conditions of the sampling areas, with less specific identification levels, such as family, possibly indicating changes in areas under the restoration process. © 2021.

AB  - Recent research has shown that the entire southern rim of Amazonia was inhabited by earth-building societies involving landscape engineering, landscape domestication and likely low-density urbanism during the Late Holocene. However, the scale, timing, and intensity of human settlement in this region remain unknown due to the dearth of archaeological work and the logistical difficulties associated with research in tropical forest environments. A case in point are the newly discovered Mound Villages (AD ∼1000-1650) in the SE portion of Acre State, Brazil. Much of recent pioneering work on this new archaeological tradition has mainly focused on the excavation of single mounds within sites with little concern for the architectural layout and regional settlement patterns, thus preventing us from understanding how these societies were organised at the regional level. To address these shortcomings, we carried out the first Lidar survey with a RIEGL VUX-1 UAV Lidar sensor integrated into an MD 500 helicopter. Our novel results documented distinctive architectural features of Circular Mound Villages such as the presence of ranked, paired, cardinally oriented, sunken roads interconnecting villages, the occurrence of a diversity of mound shapes within sites, as well as the exposure the superimposition of villages. Site size distribution analysis showed no apparent signs of settlement hierarchy. At the same time, it revealed that some small groups of villages positioned along streams exhibit regular distances of 2.5-3 km and 5-6 km between sites. Our data show that after the cessation of Geoglyph construction (∼AD 950), this region of SW Amazonia was not abandoned, but occupied by a flourishing regional system of Mound Villages. The results continue to call into question traditional views that portray interfluvial areas and the western sector of Amazonia as sparsely inhabited. A brief discussion of our findings in the context with pre-Columbian settlement patterns across other regions of Amazonia is conducted. © 2021 Ubiquity Press. All right reserved.

AB  - The objective of this work is to compare the vegetation domains described by Saint-Hilaire at 1817 to current phytophysionomic classifications and ecotone areas for the region between Diamantina, Serro and Minas Novas, Minas Gerais, Brazil. A database was elaborated from the analysis of his works with localities, species and descriptions of the vegetation strata for the trajectory he traveled and steps he covered in the field. Current vegetation and land cover maps were elaborated using the ArcGIS 10.3.1 software. Three paths were defined from the analysis of the traveller's works. Vegetation domains such as virgin forest, catingas, carrasqueiros, carrascos and natural grasslands, described by Saint Hilaire for Minas Gerais were described in the study area and compared to the current phytophysiognomies: Semi-deciduous Seasonal Forests, Deciduous Seasonal Forests; Open Arboreal Caatinga; Dense, Typical, Ralo and Rupestrian Cerrado; Dirty, Clean and Rupestrian Grasslands respectively. The naturalist describes anthropic domains called capoeira and artificial grasslands whose vegetation is at different stages of ecological succession. Comparisons between old and current descriptions have proved to be feasible and relevant. This information contributes with ecological, biological and geographical data, subsidizing studies and strategies for the conservation of the natural resources of Biomes. © Universidade de Lisboa.

AB  - The study of forest regeneration allows the diagnosis of conservation status of fragments and estimating population parameters that are essential for management projects. This study evaluated the structure, diversity and dynamics of the tree regenerating component of a remnant of mixed ombrophilous forest, aiming to support management actions for this forest type. The study was developed at the Parque Estadual das Araucárias (PEAR), located in the western region of the state of Santa Catarina, southern Brazil. A total of 100 plots of 25 m2 (0.25 ha) were allocated, all individuals with height ≥ 1.0 m and DBH < 5 cm were sampled. Shannon’s diversity index (H’), Pielou’s equability index (J) and total natural regeneration rate (TNR) were estimated. We sampled 1,425 individuals from 99 species and 39 families, with an estimated total density of 5,700 individuals by hectare. The richest families were Fabaceae (13), Myrtaceae (10) and Lauraceae (7). The H’ was 3.76 and the J was 0.80. The TNR rate ranged from 0.05 to 8.12%, highlighting Trichilia elegans, with the highest rate and Araucaria angustifolia with low potential for natural regeneration. The analysis of the results indicated a high diversity in the regenerating component of the PEAR compared to other studies, probably because the area presents itself as a successional mosaic due to past disturbances. © Manuela Gazzoni dos Passos et al.

AB  - The study was conducted in a portion of tropical montane forest in the Caparaó National Park, Brazil. The aim of this work was to assess the changes in seed bank composition, density and richness along an altitudinal gradient and across seasons, and to analyse the floristic links between the forest soil seed bank, seed rain, regeneration layer and adult tree layer. The seed bank data were collected in the dry and rainy seasons at seven different elevations, ranging from 1112 - 1550 m above sea level. The floristic relationships were analysed through the species lists derived from previous studies at these same locations. The results showed seed density and species richness varied among different elevations, but did not vary with gradient. Seed bank density and richness varied significantly across seasons, with the highest averages found in the rainy season. In the floristic composition, the higher elevations showed more similar composition than to the lower elevations. Seed bank composition was floristically different from the seed rain, the regeneration layer and the adult tree layer of the forest. Our results showed that the soil seed bank was influenced by both altitude and environmental seasonality. The findings highlighted the importance soil seed bank as a mechanism of post-disturbance forest regeneration. © Forest Research Institute Malaysia.

AB  - The soil seed bank can be an important source for vegetation regeneration, and data on the similarity between aboveground vegetation and the seed bank can provide information about successional pathways after disturbances or land-use change. We conducted this study in natural grasslands in the subtropical highland region in southern Brazil. We evaluated the effect of silviculture on richness, density, and composition of the seed bank at former grassland sites converted to pine plantations 25 years ago. We worked at six grassland sites and three pine plantation sites and used the seedling emergence method. Seed bank density and richness in grasslands were lower than those reported in similar environments in other regions. Species richness and density varied considerably within each vegetation type; therefore, richness and density were not statistically significant, while composition varied among vegetation types. In terms of species, the pine plantation seed bank was a small subset of the grassland seed bank. Seeds of typical grassland species were missing in the pine plantation, but also had only low abundances in the grassland, and similarity of seed bank and vegetation were low (less than 20%). The low seed density found in this study, including in grasslands areas, indicates that regeneration of species from the soil seed bank likely is of a limited role for the maintenance of plant populations after disturbances in this system. Our data further suggest that natural regeneration after tree planting in grasslands is reduced due to seed limitation.

AB  - The modern Amazonian rainforest has a great fascination and global significance, but our knowledge of past landscape changes is still limited due to sparse data and the lack of radiometric age constrains. Precise dating in records older than the late Pleistocene are difficult to obtain and often regionally confined, therefore biostratigraphic correlations are used to estimate depositional ages across sedimentary basins. Aiming for a better understanding of the Neogene changes in western Brazil, we studied palynology and ostracod assemblages from the Solimões Formation, a key site for paleoenvironmental models to discuss the biotic changes in Amazonia. Further, we compare the biostratigraphic information of both groups with radiometric maximum deposition ages constrained by U/Pb measurements on detrital zircon grains. Down to the depth of ~95 m, zircon populations show a maximum deposition age of 11.42 ± 0.66 Ma documenting Tortonian (late Miocene) or younger ages for the top of the Solimões Formation. Palynological biostratigraphy show the Psilatricolporites caribbiensis zone (latest Miocene–Pliocene) down to a depth of 181.8 m, where the Grimsdalea magnaclavata zone suggests a late middle Miocene to early late Miocene age. In comparison, ostracod biostratigraphy indicates the Cyprideis cyrtoma zone (late Miocene) down to 176.0 m and the Cyprideis minipunctata (late middle to late Miocene) for the bottom of the section. Thus, both biostratigraphic concepts suggest ages close to the maximum ages indicated by the detrital zircons. This comparison of the biozonations with U/Pb maximum deposition ages represents the first independent calibration of these widely used methods for age determination in the Solimões Basin. Palynological and ostracod data illustrate dynamic environments varying from fluvial settings with wetland forests and swamps to lakes and/or abandoned channels with temporary slightly saline conditions. Instead of a slow evolution of Neogene Amazonian environments, our results show migrating rivers and waterbodies surrounded by rainforest during the period recorded by the base and top of the studied core material, separated by a phase of more extensive lakes and swamps (core depth 90–120 m). Indicators for slightly elevated salinity are found until the topmost sample and thus persisted during the late Miocene. This highlights the importance of new age control to improve the regional biostratigraphic timescale and reconstructed environmental changes. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Research results are given to assess the impact of two management types of the herbaceous extract such as pasture (traditional and improved with overseeding) in the natural regeneration of the arboreal component in MOF remnants in the north of Santa Catarina, Brazil, so that the regeneration of the mixed ombrophilous forest (MOF) could be better understood. The extraction of mate and milk-production livestock, regionally called caíva, occurs. Regardless of the management, natural regeneration of MOF´s typical arboreal species is an active process which is present in all evaluated caívas. There was significant difference in diversity and total density in regeneration components, significantly in overseeding caívas. High occurrence of regrowth and the reduced presence of damaged clues in pasture suggest frequent cuttings, rather than animal trampling and pasturing, are processes linked to caivas management with significant negative impact on regeneration. Although the caívas under analysis have shown satisfactory regeneration levels, measures should be adopted to lessen the negative pressures on the system. © 2020 University Center of Maringa.

AB  - Tropical secondary forests (SF) play an important role in the global carbon cycle as a major terrestrial carbon sink. Here, we use high-resolution TerraClass data set for tracking land use activities in the Brazilian Amazon from 2004–2014 to detect spatial patterns and carbon sequestration dynamics of secondary forests (SF). By integrating satellite lidar and radar observations, we found the SF area in the Brazilian Amazon increased from approximately 22 Mha (106 ha) in 2004 to 28 Mha in 2014. However, the expansion in area was also accompanied by a dynamic land use activity that resulted in about 50% recycling of SF area annually from frequent clearing and abandonment. Consequently, the average age of SF remained less than 10 years (age ~8.2 with one standard deviation of 3.2 spatially) over the period of the study. Estimation of changes of carbon stocks shows that SF accumulates approximately 8.5 Mg ha−1 year−1 aboveground biomass during the first 10 years after clearing and abandonment, 4.5 Mg ha−1 year−1 for the next 10 years followed by a more gradual increase of 3 Mg ha−1 year−1 from 20 to 30 years with much slower rate thereafter. The effective carbon uptake of SF in Brazilian Amazon was negligible (0.06 ± 0.03 PgC year−1) during this period, but the interannual variability was significantly larger (±0.2 PgC year−1). If the SF areas were left to grow without further clearing for 100 years, it would absorb about 0.14 PgC year−1 from the atmosphere, partially compensating the emissions from current rate of deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon. ©2020.

AB  - ‘Peroba rosa’ (Aspidosperma polyneuron Muell. Arg.) is a forest species native to Brazil, which is threatened of extinction due to intense predatory exploitation. Knowing the physiological and sanitary aspects of the seeds or seedlings of native species is essential to determine the viability of the establishment of seedlings and natural regeneration. In tropical regions such as Brazil, the susceptibility of phytopathogens in native forest species is still poorly understood. In this work, we report for the first time Fusarium species associated with pathogenicity in Aspidosperma polyneuron. We identified a diverse group of crop pathogens Fusarium species - F. solani, F. oxysporum, F. verticillioides, F. equiseti, F. fujikuroi, F. pseudocircinatum and F. subglutinans from seeds, able to cause darkening of the leaf limb of inoculated seedlings. These results provide valuable information on the pathogenic association of Fusarium with an indigenous forest tree and possible risks these fungi might pose to the forest species. © 2020, Koninklijke Nederlandse Planteziektenkundige Vereniging.

AB  - Secondary vegetation (SV) from land abandonment is a common transition phase between agricultural uses following tropical deforestation. The impact of SV on carbon sequestration and habitat fragmentation across tropical forest frontiers therefore depends on SV dynamics and demographics. Here, we used time series of annual MapBiomas land cover data to generate the first estimates of SV extent, age, and net carbon uptake in the Brazilian Amazon between 1985 and 2017. SV increased over time, totaling 12 Mha in 2017, 44% of which was ≤5 years old. Between 1988 and 2017, 19.6 Mha of SV was cleared, adding 45.5% to the area of primary deforestation detected by the Brazilian monitoring system (PRODES). Rates of SV loss have exceeded PRODES deforestation since 2011. Based on the age and extent of gains and losses, SV was a small net carbon sink during this period (8.9 Tg C yr-1). As SV is not formally protected by national environmental legislation or monitored by PRODES, long-term benefits from SV in the Brazilian Amazon remain uncertain. © 2020 The Author(s).

AB  - Less than 10% of the original Atlantic Forest cover now remains standing in the Brazilian state of Sergipe, although few scientific studies have focused on its mammalian diversity. The present study describes the diversity of non-volant mammals found in the Ibura National Forest (INF), based on live trapping, and direct and indirect observations. We sampled the IBF on six days per month between June 2012 and August 2013, using live-traps (Sherman-type) positioned in pairs (ground and understory). We equally sampled semideciduous forest and an abandoned Eucalyptus plantation with dense understory (over 30 years). We also used non-systematics methods (direct observations, vestiges, camera-trap, and opportunistic captures). We recorded 18 species, from 12 families and 7 orders considering all the applied methods. Among recorded species, Bradypus torquatus and Lontra longicaudis are considered threatened of extinction. Considering only the live-trapping (totaling 3,240 trapping nights), we captured 125 individuals (3.85% success) from four species, Marmosa demerarae (52%), Didelphis albiventris (19.2%), Cerradomys vivoi (15.2%), and M. murina (13.6%). Estimated and observed richness was the same, suggesting a satisfactory effort. Didelphis albiventris and M. demerarae showed significantly higher captures in the dry seasons. Didelphis albiventris and C. vivoi showed significantly higher captures in the substratum, and M. demerarae higher in the understory. Cerradomys vivoi showed significantly higher captures in the Eucalyptus phytophysiognomy. Non-Metric Multidimensional Scaling and the ANOSIM showed a significant difference in the captured species among semidecidual forest and Eucalyptus. Despite the small area (144 ha), the INF still houses a relatively high mammalian diversity. Further investigations may help to understand the role of habitat reduction in the diversity and habitat partitioning among mammal species in the Atlantic Forest of Northeastern Brazil. © 2020, Eduem - Editora da Universidade Estadual de Maringa.

AB  - Global food and water security analysis and management require precise and accurate global cropland-extent maps. Existing maps have limitations, in that they are (1) mapped using coarse-resolution remote-sensing data, resulting in the lack of precise mapping location of croplands and their accuracies; (2) derived by collecting and collating national statistical data that are often subjective, leading to substantial uncertainties in cropland-area estimates, as well as their locations; and (3) extracted from one or more classes of a land use–land cover product in which cropland classes are not the focus of mapping, leading to their mixing with other classes and creating significant errors of omission and commission. These limitations can be overcome by producing high-resolution cropland-extent maps using satellite-sensor data, such as Landsat 30-m resolution or higher. The most fundamental cropland product is the high-resolution cropland-extent map because all higher level cropland products, such as crop-watering method (that is, whether crops are irrigated or rainfed), crop types, cropping intensities, cropland fallows, crop productivity, and crop-water productivity, are dependent on a precise and accurate cropland-extent product. Given these realities, the overarching goal of this study was to produce a Landsat satellite-derived global cropland-extent product at 30-m resolution. The work, which involved a paradigm shift in how global cropland-extent maps are produced, involved the following five key steps: (1) petabyte-scale computing that involved multiyear, 8- to 16-day, time-series Landsat 30-m resolution data for the global land surface; (2) composition of analysis-ready data (ARD) cubes; (3) creation of a large global-reference data hub for machine learning; (4) use of multiple machine-learning algorithms (MLAs) by writing software and computing in the cloud; and (5) Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud computing. The five key steps involved nine distinct phases. First, the world was segmented into 74 agroecological zones (AEZs). Second, Landsat 8- to 16-day data were used to time-composite 10-band (blue, green, red, near-infrared, short-wave infrared band 1, short-wave infrared band 2, thermal infrared, enhanced vegetation index, normalized difference water index, and normalized difference vegetation index) Landsat 30-m resolution data cubes for every 2- to 4-month time period during 3- to 4-year periods (stated as nominal-year 2015 or, simply, 2015), along with two additional 30-m resolution bands (Shuttle Radar Topography Mission elevation, and slope) in each of the 74 AEZs. Third, more than 100,000 reference-training data samples were collected using ground data (some of which were collected using a mobile application), as well as submeter- to 5-m-resolution, very high-resolution imagery sourced from other reliable sources. Fourth, reference-training data were used to create a knowledge base for separating cropland from noncropland. Fifth, MLAs such as the pixel-based supervised random forest and support-vector machines were written on the GEE using Python and JavaScript. Sixth, object-based recursive hierarchical segmentation algorithm was used, in addition to MLAs, to overcome uncertainties. Seventh, MLAs used the knowledge base to classify and separate cropland from noncropland. Eighth, accuracy assessment was conducted by generating error matrices for each of the 74 AEZs using 19,171 independent validation-data samples. Ninth, cropland areas were computed for all countries of the world and compared with United Nation’s (UN’s) Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) and other national statistics. The outcome was a Landsat-derived global cropland-extent product at 30-m resolution (GCEP30), which has an overall accuracy of 91.7 percent. For the cropland class, producer’s accuracy was 83.4 percent, and user’s accuracy was 78.3 percent. GCEP30 calculated (using direct pixel count) the global net-cropland area (GNCA) for the year 2015 as 1.873 billion hectares (~12.6 percent of the Earth’s terrestrial area). The continental cropland distribution as a percentage of GNCA was Asia, 33 percent; Europe, 25.5 percent; Africa, 16.7 percent; North America, 14.4 percent; South America, 8.1 percent; and Australia and Oceania, 2.4 percent. The worldwide cropland areas in GCEP30 for 2015 were higher by 236 to 299 million hectares (Mha) compared to national statistics reported elsewhere for the same year (for example, in Food and Agriculture Organization’s corporate statistical database [FAOSTAT] and in the monthly irrigated and rainfed crop areas [MIRCA] database). The global cropland area reported for 2015 increased by 344 Mha (22.5 percent), compared to the year 2000. During the same period (2000–2015), the world’s population increased by 20 percent. Whereas some of these areal increases are real increases in cropland areas, others are due to the types of data, methods, and approaches used. Using the highest known resolution (compared to previous coarse-resolution global products) enabled this study to capture fragmented croplands. Coarse-resolution data compute areas on the basis of subpixels, which, for a large proportion of certain land use–land cover classes, will show only a certain percentage of the total pixel area as actual area. Subpixel areas can lead to substantial uncertainties in area computation, as determining the exact fraction of cropland areas within a coarse-resolution pixel is resource intensive and subject to errors. Other innovations in GCEP30 include reference-data hubs, machine learning, and cloud computing. Cropland areas in 214 countries, territories, departments, and regions were calculated for the year 2015 using GCEP30, on the basis of UN’s global administrative unit layers (GAUL) boundaries. The 10 leading countries in terms of cropland area (as a percentage of the GNCA) were India (9.6 percent), United States (8.95 percent), China (8.82 percent), Russia (8.32 percent), Brazil (3.42 percent), Ukraine (2.32 percent), Canada (2.29 percent), Argentina (2.05 percent), Indonesia (2 percent), and Nigeria (1.91 percent). Together, these 10 countries occupy 50 percent of the global cropland, and they have 52 percent of the global population. Their combined cropland area increased by 2 percent between 2000 and 2015, compared to the substantial increase in population of 517 million (15.5 percent). Together, India, United States, China, and Russia encompass 36 percent of the total area. In the United States and Canada, from 2000 to 2015, cropland decreased by about 2 percent, whereas their populations increased by 14 and 13 percent, respectively. The additional food requirements in these 10 countries, which are caused by increased populations, as well as increasing nutritional demands, are met by production increases in existing cropland or through virtual food trade, or both. More than 18 countries, territories, departments, or regions had 60 percent or more of their geographic area as cropland: Republic of Moldova, San Marino, and Hungary had more than 80 percent of the country’s area as cropland; Denmark, Ukraine, Ireland, and Bangladesh, 70 to 80 percent; and Uruguay, Netherlands, United Kingdom, Spain, Lithuania, Poland, Gaza Strip, Czechia, Italy, India, and Azerbaijan, 60 to 70 percent. Europe and South Asia can be considered agricultural capitals of the world, on the basis of their percentages of geographic area as cropland. United States, China, and Russia, which all have high cropland areas, are ranked second, third, and fourth in the world; India is ranked first. However, the amount of cropland as a percentage of the country’s geographic area is relatively very low for United States (18.3 percent), China (17.7 percent), and Russia (9.5 percent), whereas it is 60.5 percent for India. Most African and South American countries, territories, departments, or regions have less than 15 percent of their geographic area as cropland. China and India together house 36 percent of the world’s population; however, between 2000 and 2015, the amount of China’s cropland area fell by 18.9 percent, owing to urban expansion and the abandonment of farmlands caused by demographic changes (that is, the movement of population from villages to cities). In contrast, China’s population grew by 10 percent. The amount of India’s cropland increased by 8.5 percent, whereas its population grew by 20 percent. This study showed that, out of the 10 leading cropland countries, Ukraine, Nigeria, Russia, and Indonesia showed an 18 to 31 percent increase in cropland areas, on the basis of GCEP30 by the year 2015, compared to 2000. Nigeria’s cropland area increased by 25 percent, and its population increased by 31 percent in the same period. In these countries, food security is maintained by cropland expansion, productivity increases, and virtual food trade. Nevertheless, this trend of increasing net-cropland area and productivity will likely become difficult to maintain, owing to diminishing arable lands and plateauing of 50 years of continual yield increases, requiring policymakers to explore novel and data-supported approaches to solving future food security issues.

AB  - This study aimed to evaluate the ecological succession under different proportions of nitrogen-fixing trees intercropped with non-nitrogen fixing trees species through the understory floristic survey. A randomized block design with four treatments and three replications was conducted for 13 years with 30, 50, 65, and 80% of nitrogen-fixing trees in the whole plants used per plot. Fixed subplots with 10 m x 10 m were installed at the experimental plots and evaluated all individuals with height ≥ 60 cm to carry out the floristic survey. The species were identified and classified according to growth habit, the successional class, and dispersion syndrome. The natural regeneration vertical structure was evaluated with the following indicators: absolute density, absolute frequency, and relative frequency, the horizontal structure with Shannon’s diversity index and Pielou’s equitability index. The survey founded 37 species that had not been planted initially. Only three of the 13 planted species were present in the seedling bank. It was identified a more significant presence of pioneer trees species with zoochoric dispersion in the four treatments understory, indicating that the species mixed allowed the activation of the natural succession process. Treatments with 50 and 65 % of nitrogen-fixing trees favoured the diversity of species. © 2021, Universidade Federal de Santa Maria. All rights reserved.

AB  - The Atlantic forest is one of the most threatened tropical forest ecosystem in the world, and despite current knowledge, its ability to recover structure and diversity after a disturbance is still a matter of debate. Quantifying carbon stocks and species diversity in forests at different successional stages and assessing their recovery capacity is important for designing local conservation and restoration strategies. We investigated the resilience potential of lowland Atlantic forests at landscape-scale using a chronosequence approach in 160 0.1-ha permanent plots, three old-growth and 13 second-growth forests at various stages of recovery. We assessed whether tree species richness, including species with high conservation values (endemic and threatened), composition and aboveground carbon stock recover along succession; and estimated how much of the old-growth forest values the 20-yr-old secondary forests had attained and the time needed to reach old-growth forests levels. Species richness, composition and carbon stock tended to recover along the chronosequence, while endemic and threatened species showed no relationship with forest age. After 20 yr of succession, the secondary forests recovered on average 52% of total species richness, 21% of species composition and only 16% of carbon stock of old-growth forests. We predicted that the absolute recovery of lowland Atlantic forests would take eight decades to thousands of years, much longer than the 10–40 years targeted by national efforts to restore degraded ecosystems. Despite slow recovery, these regenerating forests are important for climate mitigation and biodiversity conservation as they potentially sequester 1.78 Mg C ha−1 yr−1 and harbor a number of species comparable to old-growth forests. Our findings indicate that achieving landscape restoration and conservation goals through passive restoration can be a challenge, highlighting the need to invest in management plans in areas with relatively low resilience and high biodiversity and carbon conservation values. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Hydroelectric dams represent an important threat to seasonally flooded environments in the Amazon basin. We aimed to evaluate how a dam in the Madeira River, one of the largest tributaries of the Amazonas River, affected floodplain avifauna. Bird occurrence was recorded through simultaneous passive acoustic monitoring in early successional vegetation and floodplain forest downstream from the dam and upstream in sites impacted by permanent flooding after dam reservoir filling. Species were identified through manual inspection and semi-automated classification of the recordings. To assess the similarity in vegetation between downstream and upstream sites, we used Landsat TM/ETM+ composite images from before (2009-2011) and after (2016-2018) reservoir filling. Downstream and upstream floodplain forest sites were similar before, but not after dam construction. Early successional vegetation sites were already different before dam construction. We recorded 195 bird species. While species richness did not differ between upstream and downstream sites, species composition differed significantly. Ten species were indicators of early successional vegetation upstream, and four downstream. Ten species were indicators of floodplain forest upstream, and 31 downstream. Seven of 24 floodplain specialist species were detected by the semi-automated classification only upstream. While we found some bird species characteristic of early successional vegetation in the upstream sites, we did not find most species characteristic of tall floodplain forest. Predominantly carnivorous, insectivorous, and nectarivorous species appear to have been replaced by generalist and widely distributed species. © 2021, Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas da Amazonia.

AB  - (The influence of forest litter on the endomicorritic fungi community in a natural regeneration area in São Paulo State, Brazil). Natural areas of high biological diversity are being degraded to meet man’s need to convert them to various uses. The ecological restoration through litter transposition enables for the reestablishment of ecological processes and may contribute to the increase of microorganisms. It aimed to evaluate the influence of litter on the community of mycorrhizal fungi in an area of Cabreúva, São Paulo State, Brazil. Ten plots were delimited, five control and five treatment. Soil samples were collected during two distinct periods for physical, chemical and microbiological analysis. Results indicated that the edaphic conditions of the place are consistent with the presence of AMF; also, the transposed organic matter did not increase species richness and did not facilitate the colonization of plant species, whereas gravimetric humidity and grass may have influenced species richness © 2021, SciELO-Scientific Electronic Library Online.

AB  - Questions: Carbon dynamics in tropical forests is influenced by a variety of biotic and abiotic factors that act over temporal and spatial scales. At the local scale, carbon stock and dynamics can be determined by the environment and ecosystem diversity. Also, during forest regeneration, which is a temporal process, it is expected that those factors that influence carbon also change over time. Here we examine how carbon stock and dynamics are influenced by forest age, environment and functional diversity during forest regeneration. Using the relative effects of the different drivers of carbon dynamics, we attempt to discern the mechanisms (mass effect or niche complementarity) that explain those processes. Location: We carried out this study in Atlantic Forest of different ages during natural regeneration in southern Brazil. Methods: We measured environmental characteristics (soil physical and chemical attributes and canopy openness), estimated functional diversity and above-ground carbon and its dynamics over time. We examined univariate and multivariate predictors of carbon stock and dynamics using structural equation models. Results: We found that age had the strongest influence on carbon stock, while environmental characteristics, functional and taxonomic diversities were much less important or unimportant. Our results suggest that the influence of time on tropical forest carbon dynamics overlaps and outweighs the effects due to environmental limits and mechanisms mediated by diversity (mass effects, niche complementarity). Conclusions: Natural regeneration can be an effective strategy for restoring carbon sequestration and methods that use manipulation of regenerating forests with the hope of improving the process are unlikely to bring additional advantage in terms of carbon sequestration. © 2020 International Association for Vegetation Science

AB  - Context: Neighbouring forests constitute biological sources that enable the succession from species-poor systems, such as tree-plantings, to highly diverse forests. However, old forest patches are becoming rare in tropical agricultural landscapes. Objective: We were interested in if, and how, spontaneous regeneration under tree-plantings reflects the age and the amount of the neighbouring forest cover. We anticipated that older forests promote a compositionally broader recovery in neighbouring tree-plantings, because older forests likely include disturbance-sensitive species, particularly within least deforested landscapes. Methods: We studied twenty-seven restoration sites implemented as tree-plantings in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. We quantified the effects of age and amount of neighbouring forest cover on structural and compositional characteristics of the regeneration community (dbh < 5 cm). We used two landscape groups (presence, or absence, of forests older than 30 years.) with a similar areal range of forest cover, enabling the disentanglement of forest age from forest amount effects on regeneration community responses. Results: Surprisingly, we found that greater forest cover correlated with denser and more species-rich regeneration communities only when neighbouring forests were young. This pattern was promoted by non-vertebrate dispersed species. Regeneration communities in tree-plantings near to young forests had lower seed-mass and relative abundances of forest-specialists, compared to communities found near old forest patches. Conclusion: Regeneration is likely denser in landscapes of vast young-forest coverage. However, small-seeded and habitat-generalist species, frequently related to disturbance tolerance, tend to be dominant if old-growth forests are far away. This biased seed source appears to preclude the restoration of typical historic tropical forest composition. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - Among the various applications of phytosociology, the evaluation of natural regeneration is of great importance, mainly because it provides insights for ecological restoration. The objective of this study was to analyze the composition and phytosociological parameters of shrub and tree vegetation in areas of plantation of eucalyptus (Corymbia citriodora) and areas of native forest in the Ibura National Forest, located in the Sergipe state of northeastern Brazil. For this purpose, 20 plots were sampled and all individuals with a diameter at breast height (DBH) ≥ 8 cm were measured. Sampling revealed 821 individuals in the forest area and 1,000 in the eucalyptus area. These individuals represent 84 species and the areas presented a significant difference in species composition, with 61 in the eucalyptus area and 65 in the Forest area, and only 40 species were common to both areas. There was a predominance of pioneer individuals in the eucalyptus area. There also was a significant difference in basal area, relative density and relative dominance, but no significant differences were observed in average height. It was concluded that a period of 35 years is insufficient for the recovery of the eucalyptus area, which remains in a more initial successional stage than the forest area. © José Paulo Santana et al.

AB  - International forest landscape restoration commitments have promoted the restoration of millions of hectares of degraded and deforested lands globally, but few forest restoration approaches provide both ecologically-sound and financially-viable solutions for achieving the spatial scale proposed. One potential revenue source for restoration is selective harvesting of timber, a product for which there is a clear global market and increasing demand. The use of commercially valuable exotic trees may attract farmers to restoration, but can be a major concern for ecologists. Here, we present results collected over 7 years from experimental studies at three sites across the Brazilian Atlantic Forest to assess the impacts of incorporating exotic eucalypts as a transitional stage in tropical forest restoration on above-ground biomass accumulation, native woody species regeneration and financial viability. Biomass accumulation was nine times greater in mixed eucalypt-native species plantations than native only plantings due to fast eucalypt growth. Nonetheless, the growth of native non-pioneer trees was not affected or only slightly reduced by eucalypts prior to logging. Eucalypts did not negatively affect the natural regeneration of native woody species before or after eucalypt logging. Canopy cover regrew quickly but was slightly lower a year following logging in mixed eucalypt-native species plantations. Natural regeneration richness and planted non-pioneer growth were similar across treatments in the post-logging period. We found higher variation of biomass accumulation and native species regeneration among sites than between plantation types within sites. The income from eucalypt wood production offset 44%–75% of restoration implementation costs. Synthesis and applications. Many of the negative effects attributed to eucalypts on the growth and natural regeneration of native trees depend on features of the production system, landscape structure, soil, and climate in which they are grown, rather than the effects of eucalypts per se. In Brazil's Atlantic Forest region, exotic eucalypts can become important allies of tropical forest restoration, and their use and investment opportunities should be considered within the portfolio of options supported by public and private funding and policies. © 2019 The Authors.

AB  - Restoring degraded areas is an effective strategy to reestablish the environmental services provided by the forests including global warming mitigation by carbon sequestration. Restoring lands is especially important in the Atlantic Forest, a global hotspot in Brazil threatened by deforestation. To successfully restore degraded lands, it is necessary to apply the most suitable method for each situation. However, studies comparing restoration techniques are scarce. This lack of information hampers the Atlantic Forest restoration and, given the original complexity of its ecological dynamics, restoration success is even more challenging in this ecosystem. This study aimed to assess carbon stocks (above and belowground), carbon content (%), and carbon isotope at 5-year old sites implemented by different restoration methods in southeastern Brazil. The restoration methods tested were active restoration (AR), assisted restoration (AsR), and passive restoration in an abandoned pasture (AP), which were compared to a nearby pasture (P) and a remaining forest fragment (RF). The assessed pools were: tree, coarse roots, fine roots, herbaceous, litter, standing dead wood, fallen dead wood, and soil (0–1 cm, 5–10 cm, 10–20 cm layers). Total carbon stock was higher on RF (152.304 Mg C ha−1), followed by the P (84.378 Mg C ha−1), AR (66.414 Mg C ha−1), AsR (65.73 Mg C ha−1) and AP (65.581 Mg C ha−1). The restoration areas sites are still too young to show significant differences in total carbon stock as a result of different restoration methods. However, carbon stock and carbon content (%) differed among the pools according to the method and, in all cases, the largest carbon pool was soil, which shows the importance of sampling every pool for carbon stock and carbon content (%) estimation. Isotope analysis showed that carbon inputs in the soil had different sources, C3 or C4 plants, depending on the method. We concluded that these young secondary areas are already sequestering carbon, which helps mitigate global warming, and that monitoring every pool is important for a complete assessment, not only to restore secondary forests and understand growth but also for other land-uses such as pastures. Besides, the results obtained can be generalized to other tropical forest ecosystems with similar conditions (local and landscape), constituting a relevant contribution to forest restoration and carbon-sequestration related sciences. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The objective of this work was to evaluate the effect of brushwood, black plastic mulch, herbicide, and artificial perch on the natural regeneration of native species in Urochloa grassland. The experiment was conducted between February 2014 and February 2016 in the Dense Ombrophilous Forest, in the municipality of Morretes, in the state of Paraná, Brazil. The treatments were: herbicide, herbicide + perch, black plastic mulch, black plastic mulch + perch, brushwood + herbicide, brushwood + herbicide + perch, and a control treatment. The evaluations were carried out at 4, 8, 12, 18, and 24 months after the installation of the experiment, by counting and identifying regenerating woody species and estimating visually the percentage of herbaceous coverage. Initially, brushwood and black plastic mulch reduced the Urochloa grasses; however, this effect was lost over time due to the rapid growth of the grasses from the edges to the center of the plots. The use of perches in the treatments does not allow a significant increase of other species because of the continued inhibiting conditions for the establishment of seedlings. The herbicide is effective in removing the grasses; however, the recruitment of woody species is only satisfactory when perches are used to attract the dispersing fauna. For a successful ecological restoration of pastures, there is a need for the local elimination of Urochloa grasses. © 2021.

AB  - With urbanisation rapidly transforming our world, a better understanding of how urban ecosystems can contribute to biodiversity conservation is urgently needed. Here, we investigated the functional composition and diversity of plant assemblages in different types of urban forests with the intent to predict the stability of the functions provided by these forests through the functional redundancy and response diversity of species. For this, we used data from non-urban mature forests, remnant urban forests, urban forests regenerated from croplands and urban forests regenerated from soil denudation, all located in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. Our results showed that species functional composition shifted among urban and non-urban forests. However, functional diversity was lost only in urban forests with some previous use, indicating that the natural regeneration of urban forests after previous land use results in functionally poor forests. Urban forests regenerated from soil denudation (more intense disturbance) had a lower functional diversity. Conversely, urban forests regenerated from cropland (less intense disturbance) showed only a reduction in the number of functions provided. Our analysis also revealed the reduced functional redundancy and response diversity of urban forests with previous land use, which may indicate a greater vulnerability of the functions provided by these forests. Thus, we emphasise in this study the importance of land use history for decision making in urban forest conservation policies and highlight the crucial role of natural remnant urban forests as reservoirs of functional diversity and stability in highly degraded and fragmented landscapes. © 2020 Elsevier GmbH

AB  - This study aimed to identify priority areas for the passive restoration of the Arauai river basin, municipality of Moju, Para, using a multicriteria model. This basin is located in a region with intense land use dynamics and expansion of oil palm cultivation, and with high forest loss and fragmentation. The Weighted Linear Combination method was used, with the aggregation of five criteria (Natural Erosion Vulnerability, Potential Land Use and Cover to Passive Restoration, Proximity to the Primary Forest, Forest cover deficit in PPAs, and Distance from Roads and Highways). This analysis allowed to evaluate different biophysical classes and types of land use that affect the selection of areas for restoration. A total of 207.82 km2 of priority areas for passive restoration were identified in the studied basin, with about 80% of its priority areas having medium to very high priority. The final map generated proved to be a useful instrument in the environmental management of restoration plans in the Amazon watershed. © 2020, Universidade Federal Rural do Rio de Janeiro (UFRRJ).

We carried out floristic, phytosociological and remote sensing studies in a cerrado fragment located in Corumbataí (SP, Brazil) after 43 years of complete fire suppression. We surveyed 43 plots of 200 m2 each (17 plots in CS and 26 plots in CD) and all individuals ≥ 0.32 cm diameter measured at 30 cm from the ground were included in the sample. We calculated phytosociological parameters for each species and classified them in three ecological groups, namely savanna, generalist and forest species. The remote sensing analysis used aerial photographs and satellite images from 1962 to 2019 (i.e. 59 years). The structural study of community revealed high predominance of forest and generalist species when compared to savanna species. Non-linear correlation between CD expansion rates and total rainfall within the study period indicated a positive influence of the rainfall (R2 = 0.42). Thus, our analysis indicated a tendency of a continuous and fast expansion of CD over areas of CS in the long-term absence of fire combined with periods of heavy rain. © 2021, Academia Brasileira de Ciencias.

AB  - Effectively implementing landscape-scale forest restoration on the ground is particularly challenging. Available decision-support tools particularly lack the ability to comprehensively incorporate biophysical, social and institutional dimensions in a spatially explicit manner from the pixel to the whole landscape. In order to contribute to fulfilling this gap, this paper has two major objectives. The first is to present a spatially explicit decision-support tool for mapping Forest Restoration Vocation (FRV) that includes socio-economic and institutional aspects in forest landscape restoration. The second is to discuss the ways in which the FRV has been applied in the Brazilian decision-making context. The FRV was used to prioritize areas for three different restoration modalities: assisted natural regeneration (passive restoration), forest plantation with native trees to conserve biodiversity and forest plantation for agroforestry systems (active restoration). The FRV is already being adopted as a planning tool to invest R$ 1.2 billion (approx. US$ 300 million) to restore 40,000 ha in the Rio Doce, Brazil—an area corresponding to 0.05% of the area of watershed. Due to the high level of degradation of the basin, there is a need to restore 1.6 Mha via forest plantations in riparian Areas of Permanent Preservation (APPs) while 30% of APPs can be effectively restored using natural regeneration. The FRV can be effective for gauging progress and monitoring forest restoration implementation metrics across the landscape and through time. There are however still problems in effectively assessing if the investment in forest restoration will generate impact in the long term and deliver the ecosystem services society depends on. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The Bonn challenge aims at the restoration of 350 million hectares of degraded ladscapes by 2030. In Brazil, the restoration goal for 2030 is 12 million hectares. Despite the great demand for ecological restoration across the whole of Brazil, there have been no analyses of the studies carried out in different biomes. In addition, conservation efforts must cover all biomes, so that different regions can take advantage of the many benefits of restoration. Our aim was to identify advances and gaps in current restoration knowledge in order to guide future efforts in Brazil. Our bibliometric survey in the Web of Science using 23 keywords related to restoration generated a total of 530 papers, of which 291 were included in the analysis. The papers were published in 121 scientific journals between 1988 and 2018, with the largest number of papers in 2016. The Atlantic Forest was the biome with the highest number of studies, as it is one of the most threatened tropical forest regions in the world and maintains the largest number of research institutions and receives the highest level of funding support in the country. Regarding the types of studies, temporal monitoring was more frequent in the Amazon, Cerrado, Caatinga, and Pampa, while the monitoring at one point in time was more frequent in the Atlantic Forest. From the studies examined, 31% used a reference area for comparing restoration success. The most studied organisms were plants (81%), and among them, trees were the most frequent, followed by fungi, birds, invertebrates, mammals, and reptiles. The pre-restoration degradation differed among biomes, with deforestation for logging the most cited in the Amazon, agriculture, and livestock in the Atlantic Forest and Cerrado, logging and cattle ranching in Caatinga, and livestock in the Pampa and Pantanal. In general, active/assisted natural succession was the most frequent restoration process: planting seedlings more readily occurred in the Amazon, Atlantic Forest, and Caatinga, whereas natural regeneration in the Cerrado and Pantanal and sowing in Pampa. The studies varied among the age of restoration (>1 to 67 years for active restoration and >1 to 120 years for passive/unassisted natural succession), and the number of species planted (1 to 121 species). We identified an important regional knowledge gap for the Pantanal, Caatinga, and Pampa, as well as the need to include reference areas, evaluate different restoration techniques (besides planting seedlings), and the inclusion of other taxa and life forms in biodiversity studies apart from trees. We also identified the need to expand research to assess landscape metrics, prioritization, legislation, and public policies. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Reforestation and forest restoration are recognized as an effective means of halting biodiversity loss and increasing the performance of ecosystem services such as carbon sequestration and the protection and maintenance of water resources. The objective of this review is to describe the main challenges and opportunities for large-scale forest restoration and reforestation using native species in the Amazon, focusing on Pará state and the Itacaiúnas watershed. Large-scale forest restoration and reforestation in the Eastern Amazon may contribute to meeting national and global restoration commitments and reducing/eliminating the actual forest deficit caused by noncompliance with the Brazilian Native Vegetation Protection Law, concomitantly mitigating impacts on climate change, enhancing ecosystem services (e.g., protection of water resources and reduction of soil erosion) and maintaining biodiversity. The selection of active and passive reforestation approaches depends on land-use history, landscape context and reforestation targets, and the promotion of natural regeneration reduces implementation costs. To measure the ecological and socioeconomic success of forest restoration and reforestation, a large number of on-the-ground and remote indicators are available, and the use of a combination of both methods can reduce the monitoring cost. The socioeconomic benefits of reforestation include financial gains from restoration and carbon programs; furthermore, the commercialization of timber and non-timber products and their use for subsistence may improve livelihoods and farm incomes. Nevertheless, implementation of large-scale reforestation in the Eastern Amazon requires research regarding the selection and the nutritional demands of native species and the development of adequate soil management strategies that promote the growth of native species and yields. The insufficient availability of seeds and seedlings is a major bottleneck for large-scale forest restoration and reforestation with native species. Thus, increasing the availability, diversity and quality of seedlings and seeds of native species to supply the demand for planting activities, as well as the registration of producers in the National Register of Seeds and Seedlings, is necessary to achieve compliance with national legislation and international commitments. Competition between reforestation and the expansion of agricultural and cattle ranching frontiers combined with a lack of markets for commercial products from restored areas constrains the socioeconomic viability of large-scale reforestation. To outweigh deforestation incentives, regulation and effective implementation of markets and programs such as REDD+, CDM and PES is thus paramount. To enhance the integration of human well-being, socioeconomic enhancements and ecological functionality, forest and landscape restoration concepts offer promising tools for the region. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - One of the most effective procedures in the evaluation of degraded areas has been the use of remote sensing. The aim of this work was to evaluate the temporal dynamics of the NDVI and rainfall in detecting the degradation of natural resources in a semi-arid region of Brazil. The area under study is located to the west of the district of Tauá, in the State of Ceará, with a predominance of shrub-like caatinga forest. Rainfall data was obtained from FUNCEME. Ten images (dry season) were acquired from a 27-year historical series (1985-2011) from the TM/LANDSAT5 sensor, later converted to surface reflectance using the FLAASH/ENVI extension; NDVI indices were obtained and divided into six classes corresponding to land usage and occupation. The mean values of the NDVI classes were submitted to statistical analysis and compared by T-test (p < 0.05) and the Pearson correlation matrix. It was found that in the years with rainfall above the historical average (1985-1993 and 1996- 2004) there was a significant increase in degraded areas, represented by low values for the NDVI (between 0 and 0.4), due to more land being used for subsistence farming. However, during periods of drought (1993-1996 and 2004-2011), the opposite behaviour was seen, characterised by the natural regeneration of the woody stratum due to agricultural areas being abandoned; behaviour that was evidenced by increases of up to 1,807% in the moderately high class of the NDVI (between 0.6 and 0.8). The spatial and temporal dynamics of the NDVI and the rainfall therefore played a part in detecting evidence of the process of degradation of the caatinga biome in an area of the district of Tauá, in the State of Ceará. © 2018, Universidade Federal do Ceara.

AB  - Mangrove forests are important sinks of atmospheric carbon, and the internal deposits and fluxes of organic matter can reflect how these ecosystems respond to disturbances and environmental changes. Data on carbon content of mangrove forests vary geographically due to differences in abiotic (climate, geomorphic settings, tides) and biotic (diversity, herbivory, bioturbation) conditions. Mangroves have been degraded worldwide and ecological restoration is an alternative to recover these ecosystems and their functionality. However, although growing and biomass after disturbances have been addressed, studies on the recovery of faunal groups are rare. The brachyuran crab assemblage is strongly integrated to carbon recycling and ecosystem functioning, since propagule consumption and fossorial activity can affect the diversity and biomass of mangroves. We assessed the aboveground biomass and carbon stock of differently managed mangrove areas in northeastern Brazil, after being deforested for shrimp culture and then abandoned, and compared data with other forests worldwide. After a decade, the area restored with Rhizophora mangle showed higher carbon stock than the self-recovered forest and similar amount as an older forest. We discuss the applied rehabilitation measures regarding the effects of management and brachyuran crabs on forest aboveground carbon storage. The effects of herbivory and bioturbation of brachyurans on the low recruitment of Laguncularia racemosa propagules, contributed to higher biomass levels in the restored forest through reinforcing the predominance of R. mangle, which stocks more aboveground carbon with respect to Laguncularia. This suggests that the particularities of target tree species and brachyuran assemblage need to be considered in mangrove restoration, since they are related to function recovering and carbon cycling in the ecosystem. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - Objective/Context: This article presents the historical context of the creation of Goiânia, capital city of the state of Goiás, built in the 1930s as a symbol of the expansion of the demographic and agricultural frontier in central Brazil. The city emerged through the Pedro Ludovico Teixeira efforts, appointed state intervener by the President Getúlio Vargas. In the construction process, there was the boosters’s discourse, which attributed to the promised “metropolis” the power to create good opportunities for economic growth. For this, they relied on natural resources such as rivers, the presence of rich nearby forests and the fields with a less sloping region. Methodology: The study used archival sources based on technical and memorialist reports, photographs, maps, newspapers and periodicals of the time, as well as bibliography based on the theoretical and methodological assumptions of Environmental History. Originality: The historiography of Central Brazil has often been analyzed from the perspective of the frontier and not from the perspective of environmental history. In this paper, we seek to appropriate these two issues, reinforcing the relationship between the rural and urban processes of the Cerrado environmental history in Central Brazil. Conclusions: The real scenario was different from the announced one, since nature was much more a barrier than a facilitating element of development. In addition, the ideals of modern urbanism were partially abandoned due to the opportunism of selling lots. Also, the growth took place, but not because of the abundance of natural resources, but because of the transfer of the capital that fed it back as it attracted new inhabitants. © 2019, Universidad de los Andes, Bogota Colombia.

AB  - The use and unsustainable occupation in the semi-arid areas have resulted throughout its historical process in strong negative impacts by opening clearings in the areas of Caatinga, which need to be identified and studied to reverse this situation. The objective of this work was to analyze the dynamics of border of vegetation and edaphic-climatological clearings in a Caatinga area in the municipality of Sumé, state of Paraíba, Brazil. The study was conducted in the Experimental Area Reserved for Ecology and Dynamic Studies of the Caatinga of LAEB/CDSA/UFCG (7°39'38.8'' S and 36°53'42.4'' W, with 538 m of altitude). The clearings were isolated, and monitored between 2013 and 2015, soil and agrometeorological data were collected. Shrubs and live trees with diameter at ground level and height ≥0.03 and ≥ 1.0 m respectively were considered as border individuals. The highest values of soil density were observed for the clearings that presented the lowest levels of organic matter. 62% of the clearings had an increase in their area due to the high mortality of Croton blanchetianus Baill. and 38% had their area reduced due to the colonization of young, mainly Jatropha mollissima (Pohl) Baill. The floristic composition of the border comprised six species distributed in six genera and four families, being Fabaceae and Euphorbiaceae the most representative. The number of border individuals and recorded mortality were fully correlated with climatic parameters. Therefore, although the clearings are in the process of natural regeneration, climatic factors have strongly influenced the delay of this process. © 2019, Fundacao de Pesquisas Florestais do Parana.

AB  - Araucaria angustifolia is an extinction-threatened arboreal anemophilous conifer species native to Argentina and Brazil. A progressive scarcity of seeds that affects the natural regeneration and the development of new plantations has been observed. Taking into account that seed formation depends on pollination, pollen productivity was analyzed and the influence of the climate on the different reproductive phenophases evaluated. Two Argentine populations were compared: San Antonio (SA), located in the subtropical province of Misiones within its natural area, and 25 de Mayo (25M) in the temperate province of Buenos Aires. Gravimetric pollen traps were used during 2014, 2015, and 2016. It was found that the average of annual pollen productivity in 25M doubled that of SA (9440 and 5291 pollen cm−2 year−1), and that seed productivity was 10 times higher in 25M with 104 seeds per cone compared to 12 in SA. High maximum summer temperatures were favorable to the induction of reproductive structures, low minimum temperatures in August favored the maturation of pollen grains, and precipitations in the main month of pollination reduced the amount of pollen. The weather in Buenos Aires Province is more favorable for the production of reproductive material. In this context, ex situ seed banks offer the chance of enhancing and restoring native forests and in situ reforestation. © 2018

AB  - In this study, we evaluated the potential of the passive restoration approach in recovering the original forest in a region particularly important for the conservation of the Atlantic forest biodiversity. This biome has been fragmented and reduced to only 11.7% of its original range and currently its conservation relies considerably on the spontaneous regeneration of native forests in abandoned agricultural lands, a widespread phenomenon referred to in this study as passive restoration. We compare the regeneration strata of a 25-year-old secondary forest (restoration site) and of a primary forest (reference site) based on tree and shrub data in order to evaluate and characterize passive restoration in the surroundings of the Iguaçu National Park, in western Paraná State, Brazil. We recorded 589 individuals from 43 species in the restoration site and 831 individuals from 48 species in the reference site. We found smaller values of density, diversity, proportions of individuals from zoochoric and non-pioneer species; and a distinct floristic composition at the restoration site. However, plant diameter, species richness and proportions of zoochoric and non-pioneer species did not differ between sites, suggesting an appropriate successional trajectory, and the potential for the application of the passive restoration approach in the region. We found a greater number of indicator species at the reference site and some primary forest specialists were not even found at the restoration site, showing the importance of the maintenance of primary forests in the fragmented landscape in order to allow passive restoration to recover original forest attributes. © 2019, International Society for Tropical Ecology.

AB  - Both forest restoration and preservation of primary forests are worldwide conservation concerns. Studies that help to understand how restored areas act to recovery plant diversity found in primary forests are essential to plan and monitor new projects. The objective of this study was to compare the floristic composition and structure of the natural regeneration stratum of a 23-year-old restored forest (RF) with an adjacent Dense Ombrophilous Forest (PF). For this purpose, 60 plots with dimensions of 3x3 m (9m2) were equally and systematically distributed in these two areas. All shrub-tree individuals with height ≥30 cm and circumference at breast height <15 cm in these plots were included and their heights and diameter at ground level were measured. Litter and canopy openness were also sampled at the center of each plot. A total of 717 individuals from 177 species and 42 families were recorded. Canopy openness was negatively related to litter and almost all species that were related to greater canopy openness were recorded in RF. The restored forest presented high diversity, equability and density of regenerating individuals, indicating that no interventions are necessary to accelerate the ecological succession process. However, the floristic composition of RF and PF was very different. In fact, only 20 species were recorded in both areas, indicating that the presence of a highly preserved primary forest and more than two decades of restoration were not sufficient to outcome similar regeneration between these areas. Therefore, the results show that floristic composition of the natural regeneration of restored areas may take a long time to achieve the characteristics of the primary forests. © 2020 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

AB  - Ichnofossils of ghost shrimps (e.g., Ophiomorpha nodosa and Callichirus major) are interpreted worldwide as records of sea level fluctuations and provide reliable evidence of sedimentation rate, salinity, and substrate type. The preservation of these ichnofossils was previously ascribed to the polysaccharide mucus produced by ghost shrimps when burrows were built. We found evidence that these ichnofossils were preserved due to the impregnation of the burrow walls by dissolved organic matter (DOM) during podzolisation that took place after the galleries had been abandoned. Our study was conducted on a tropical barrier island in southeastern Brazil with a spatial gradient of podzolisation intensity. We made a detailed macromorphological description of the ichnofossils at the soil profile scale. Then, we used thin sections of undisturbed soils to identify sand grain arrangements and organic matter (OM) accumulation. We detected three macromorphological structures, (i) tubular gallery wall, (ii) sandy infilling of the gallery, and (iii) soil matrix outside the gallery. In the micromorphology analysis, we identified that the tubular wall is impregnated with monomorphic OM also found outside the burrow but in lower concentration. Sand grains in the wall of the gallery are tightly packed, causing a lower porosity than inside and outside the trace fossil. The precipitation of monomorphic OM is due to stagnation of DOM that percolated through the soil. Water with DOM is trapped in the wall of the tubule because of its smaller pores. The ghost shrimps constructed their burrows in marine sediments without podzolisation. Then, with the progradation of the shoreline, the sediments were colonized by restinga forest adding DOM to the soil and podzolisation started. The extent to which DOM is produced depends on vegetation development, therefore, the accumulation of DOM in the B horizon that enables the preservation of the ichnofossils is constrained by vegetation development and progradation of the shoreline. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This study aimed to evaluate stump regrowth and estimate the reconstitution of shrub-tree biomass from the stumps in an area of Caatinga under forest management in Floresta-PE, Brazil. The circumferences and heights of the stump and sprouts were measured two years after an intervention on 18 plots. The influence of the stump diameter and its height on the sprouting ability of the species was evaluated. Data was taken in the next area without intervention in order to estimate the diameter at breast height for reconstitution of the exploited biomass. We found that the tillering for Poincianella bracteosa and Aspidosperma pyrifolium was influenced by the size of the circumference, but not by the stump height. The average estimated biomass (17186.16 kg ha-1) was similar to other areas also subject to human intervention, and its reconstitution can be an auxiliary tool for monitoring illegal deforestation by environmental agencies. © 2018 University of Sao Paolo.

AB  - Mangroves cover an estimated area of approximately 12 to 20 million ha worldwide and serve as protection for the coastline from erosion and flooding. Nearly 70 mangrove species are considered endangered and could disappear in the next decade, which would have devastating economic and environmental consequences for coastal communities because of their ecological and economic importance. The annual rate of disappearance of coastal ecosystems is four times greater than the rate of the disappearance of rain forests. Mangroves suffer great pressure from the rapid conversion of forests into agricultural and urban areas, and, in these scenarios, climate change promotes specific pressures on mangroves and may increase the effects of anthropogenic activities. The focus of this study was to map the changes in mangrove areas in six river estuaries in Ceará, northeastern Brazil, between the years 1992 and 2011 and identify the main drivers of these changes. The results showed an increase in mangrove areas of five estuaries, while one estuary showed a decrease in mangrove area. Changes in river output capacity and sediment accumulation in the estuaries were associated with dam construction in the watersheds and can be responsible for new upstream mangrove areas in newly formed islands and along river banks. Abandoned saltpans also contributed to expansion of the mangrove areas. Deforestation for the construction of shrimp farms was the main cause of decreases in mangrove area, especially in the Pirangi estuary. © 2018 Coastal Education and Research Foundation, Inc.

AB  - The study aimed to describe the floristic composition and structure and life forms to lower stratum in a alluvial dense rain forest in the Environmental Protection Area of Combu Island, Belém, Pará state. Four plots were selected from 20 m x 20 m (0.16 ha) divided into 1.289 subplots of 1 m2. The size category and the life forms of the species were classified. Density, frequency, size category and natural regeneration relative were calculated. The difference in abundance, richness, Shannon index and evenness between categories was tested using ANOVA. All 33 families were found, 63 genera, 79 species and 26,885 individuals. Fabaceae, Araceae, Arecaceae, Acanthaceae and Meliaceae had higher richness. The Shannon index and Evenness were 2.63 and 0.60, respectively for the total area. Pariana campestris and Anthurium sinuatum showed higher density, size category and natural regeneration relative. Herb showed the highest percentage of individuals and natural relative regeneration and tree richest. CT1 (15 cm ≥ AT) was different from the other categories, with lower abundance and richness. It is concluded that the herb dominance in percentage of individuals and natural relative regeneration and the lower abundance and richness in CT1 is a consequence of the anthropic activities carried out such as the intensive management of açaí palm (Euterpe oleracea Mart.)

AB  - Achieving global targets for forest restoration will require cost-effective strategies to return agricultural land to forest, while minimizing implementation costs and negative outcomes for agricultural production. We present a landscape approach for optimizing the cost-effectiveness of large-scale forest restoration. Across three different landscapes within Brazil's Atlantic Forest biodiversity hotspot, we modelled landscape scenarios based on spatially explicit data on the probability of natural regeneration, restoration costs, land opportunity costs, and forest restoration outcomes for increasing carbon stocking and landscape connectivity. We compare benefits of our cost-reduction approach to the legally mandated riparian restoration and randomly distributed approaches. Compared with riparian prioritization and considering both implementation and opportunity costs, our cost-reduction scenario produced the greatest savings (20.9%) in mechanized agricultural landscapes. When only considering implementation costs, our cost-reduction scenario led to the highest savings (38.4%) in the landscape with highest forest cover where natural regeneration potential is highest and enables cost-effective carbon stocking and connectivity. Synthesis and applications. We present a guide for forest restoration planning that maximizes specific outcomes with minimal costs and reduction of agricultural production. Furthermore, we show how policies could encourage prioritization of low-cost restoration via natural regeneration, increasing cost-effectiveness. While our study focuses on Brazil's Atlantic Forest, the approach can be parameterized for other regions. © 2018 The Authors. Journal of Applied Ecology © 2018 British Ecological Society

AB  - Ecological restoration of degraded lands is a global priority. In order to improve the monitoring criteria of ecosystems affected by the Fundão tailings dam disruption in Mariana, Minas Gerais state, southeastern Brazil, it is necessary to elucidate resilience patterns and processes. Thus, proven mechanisms of resilient mitigation should be the way to improve our understanding of restoration strategies being implemented and monitored. Thus, passive and active restoration were adopted, as important and complementary methods within an integral management plan for areas directly affected by the tailings dam disruption. In this context, active restoration (i.e., planting of nursery-grown seedlings) is being implemented at 20% level of the total area affected. However, the passive restoration (natural regeneration of biodiversity and ecosystem functions) is predominating and rapidly extending up to 80% of the total area affected by the mud. The efficiency of these ecological restoration strategies in the region is being monitored according to different applied methods and using different indicators such as natural regeneration, soil seed bank, seedling mortality, species richness, soil cover (substrate formed by the tailings deposition), among others. Recently, it has been demonstrated that the success of ecological restoration is greater for passive regeneration than for active restoration in tropical forests. In this sense, we find that passive restoration is becoming increasingly important for the resilient mitigation of impacted areas. However, this technique is conditioned by drivers at landscape-scale, such as the proximity of remnant forest fragments. Likewise, due to the environmental heterogeneity conditions, active restoration measures are fundamental in degraded areas where natural regeneration is limited, mainly due to the absence of fragments in the landscape. Finally, we emphasize that passive restoration is playing an important role in the ecosystem services recovery at local-scale; which represents a major advantage to achieving the proposed resilient mitigation goals. © 2020 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

AB  - Forest and landscape restoration (FLR) is a powerful strategy for large-scale tropical forest recovery, and payment for ecosystem services (PES) is used to support FLR programs and projects on privately-owned land. In this article, we discuss the lessons learned from the Water Producer Project, a pioneer, multiple-stakeholder, and PES-supported FLR project in the Atlantic Forest, south-eastern Brazil. The project was implemented in four landscapes located in two municipalities. Altogether, 41 PES contracts with landowners were signed, resulting in various FLR practices being implemented in a total of 342.4 ha (64.2 ha for riparian forest restoration, 90.8 ha for soil conservation, and 187.4 for forest conservation) of land, which represents 39% of the project goal. As of the end of the project, only 50% (USD 49,250) of the available PES funds had been spent. However, funds spent on project planning, implementation, communication, and monitoring were 12 times greater than those spent on PES. Several challenges restricted the progress and monitoring of the project. The main issue was landowner participation and/or engagement. In terms of lessons learned, we highlight that PES schemes are more complex than initially thought, and that sufficient funding does not guarantee the success of FLR projects. It is essential to promote landowner participation and engagement by considering them key players in FLR projects. Finally, acceptance from landowners was higher and implementation was easier for forest conservation practices that required no land-use changes. Thus, we suggest that similar future projects should focus on targeting private properties in marginal agricultural lands with a high probability of natural regeneration. Alternatively, future projects could focus on lands with remnant forest cover of high conservation value. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - The objective was to evaluate the physical properties of the soil in forest areas in secondary succession and in the process of passive restoration. The areas belong to the State University of the Midwest of Paraná, Guarapuava, Brazil. The experimental design was completely randomized, with samples at six points in each area, at depths of 0 - 0.1 m, 0.1 - 0.2 m and 0.2 - 0.3 m. The forest in secondary succession had a greater amount of organic matter, this property acts directly on the other evaluated variables. The area under passive restoration had higher values for soil density, lower total porosity at the three depths and greater resistance to soil penetration, and these results are related to the history of area use. The microporosity did not differ between the studied areas and the macroporosity presented smaller values with only difference in the layer of 0.2 - 0.3 m, due to the presence of roots and decomposition of the litter. The highest value of maximum density was in the area under passive restoration (1.23 Mg m-3), with humidity of 0.32 Mg Mg-1, already in the area of forest in secondary succession this value was 1.12 Mg m-3 and humidity of 0.45 Mg Mg-1, depending on the amount of organic matter that directly influences the reduction of the density. Soil recovery in degraded areas is a slow process, and even after ten years, it was not possible to restore the ideal physical properties in the forest under passive restoration. © 2019 University of Sao Paolo.

AB  - In this study we describe a case study to evaluate the floristic diversity and the soil conditions of post mined area, currently under 14-years of restoration. The study area is located in the municipality of Descoberto, Minas Gerais State, Brazil, and has one hectare in the process of restoration through the planting of seedlings. The forest inventory of all individuals with Circumference at Breast Height (CBH) ≥15 cm was carried out and the phytosociological parameters were evaluated. The study area shows a high floristic diversity H′ = 3.258 as well as equability (J′ = 0.783), evidencing that the study area is floristically heterogeneous and has low ecological dominance. In addition, this area presented floristic similarity to other restored areas that were already in a more advanced restoration process. Considering soil quality, the restored study area shows higher levels of cation exchange capacity (t), approximate sum base values (SB) and base saturation (V) than those verified in nearby areas. Evaluating the successional characteristics (greater presence of individuals of secondary succession) and the domain of species with dispersion by animals, we can infer that the area is in an advanced stage of restoration, as well as performing its environmental and social functions. Thus, we can conclude that the restoration of mined areas is feasible when the restoration techniques are applied correctly. Furthermore, we can say that these successful restoration measures are improving the environmental sustainability and helping considerably the recovery of losses caused by mining. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  -                              Tree planting and natural regeneration are the main approaches to achieve global forest restoration targets, affecting multiple hydrological processes, such as infiltration of rainfall. Our understanding of the effect of land use history and vegetation on the recovery of water infiltration and soil attributes in both restoration strategies is limited. Therefore, we investigated the recovery of top-soil saturated soil hydraulic conductivity (K                             s                             ), soil physical and hydraulic properties in five land use types: (i) a secondary old-growth forest; (ii) a forest established through assisted passive restoration 11 years ago; (iii) an actively restored forest, with a more intensive land use history and 11 years of age; (iv) a pasture with low-intensity use; and (v) a pasture with high-intensity use, in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. For these land use types, we determined the historical land use patterns and conducted soil sampling, using the Beerkan method to determine K                             s                              values in the field. We also measured tree basal area, canopy cover, vegetation height, tree density and species richness in forest covers. The K                             s                              decreased when land use was more intense prior to forest restoration actions. Our results indicate that land use legacy is a crucial factor to explain the current difference in soil and vegetation attributes among study sites.                          © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - The recovery capacity and the successional pathways of tropical forests after anthropogenic disturbance vary considerably and may depend on prior land-use type and intensity. It is still unclear if forests subjected to high intensity impact, such as periodically burned pastures, are capable of restoring their original functional properties. This study analysed the functional trait dynamics of the dominant species in successional trajectories following two land uses, pasture or clear-cut, north of Manaus. Fourteen years of demographic data from the Biological Dynamics of Forest Fragments Project were used to determine the dominant species of the two successional trajectories, for which leaf area, leaf dry mass content, specific leaf area and wood density were collected, whereas seed mass was obtained from literature. Community weighted mean of each trait was weighted by basal area determined annually along succession. Prinicpal components analysis was used to analyse the extension and direction of the functional trajectories of plots. Forests regenerating from pastures increased in wood density through successional time, but other traits did not change significantly. Succession after clear-cut exhibited increasing leaf dry mass content and seed mass, and decreasing leaf area over time, but no change in wood density. Functional trajectories of plots after clear-cut were more extensive and directional than those of pasture-derived plots. Synthesis and applications. We demonstrate how central Amazonian secondary forests subjected to different land uses show differences in functional trait trajectories, in ways parallel to previously shown changes in biomass, floristic diversity and forest structure. These results indicate that natural recovery of forest functional traits is affected by prior land-use history, with implications for management and restoration. Thus, natural recovery of forests on abandoned pastures is much slower than clear-cuts, even though seed sources from mature forests are very close to these areas, and the former may need intervention to counteract the diverted succession. © 2019 The Authors.

AB  - This study aimed to measure the wildlife consumption of Euterpe edulis fruit and use this data to discuss management possibilities. To estimate infructescence fruit volume consumed, collectors were installed in fruit-bearing palms. To characterize consumption from the ground, samples were placed next to fruiting palms. To identify wildlife and their activities, camera traps were installed in infructescences and on the ground. The results suggested that there was a small fruit surplus (1.8 %), and this finding indicated the possibility of a harvest to reduce food for the wildlife. However, recurrent variations in the annual fruit production (21.4 %) were also noted, and suggested that wildlife could tolerate some fruit harvesting. Thus, a harvest could be restricted to fruit volume that exceeds the annual average (94 kg/ha/year). Turdus flavipes, a migratory bird, was the most active species in the dispersal of seeds; this finding indicates the need for broader conservation strategies. Wildlife composition also changed along with the fruiting, and this alteration suggests that dependence on the fruit is variable among different species. Seed germination and seedling mortality were high, results that indicate that local conditions may have a predominant effect on seed volume in natural regeneration density. © 2019, Academia Brasileira de Ciencias.

AB  - The longhorn beetles play important roles in the forest ecosystem processes and their diversity is affected by many environmental disturbances worldwide.This study aimed at understanding how the structural heterogeneity of the habitat can affect the longhorn beetle assemblage in three areas of an Atlantic Forest, which suffered differential impacts in the past and are now in different successional stages.The area in the most advanced successional stage had mainly lower density of trees, but with greater availability of dead wood, especially larger diameter classes. They are important forest components that contribute to the structural diversity of the habitat providing resources for a variety of dependent species. This area has also shown the greatest richness and abundance of longhorn beetles. Our results suggest that these beetles are closely associated with the structural heterogeneity of forests and can be valuable indicators for assessing biodiversity and quality of forest habitat. It also shows that old-growth forest remnants can be the key to the maintenance of the diversity of the longhorn beetles and, consequently, of the ecosystem services they provide. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - As deforestation and land-use/land-cover change advance in tropical forest regions, an understanding of how plants adjust phenology and reproductive dynamics to altered landscapes can provide insights into plasticity, productivity, and population persistence. We compared the reproductive phenology, sex expression, and flower and fruit production of two monoecious Amazonian palms, Attalea phalerata and Attalea speciosa, in old-growth forest and as remnant trees growing in actively grazed pastures. Using 2 years of phenology data collected from natural populations near Vila Extrema, Rondônia, and eastern Acre, Brazil, we compared flowering and fruiting in the two habitats and tested for effects of palm height, crown size, and light availability on inflorescence and sex expression. Forest conversion to pasture stimulated greater overall flowering and fruiting in individual Attalea palms. As a population, remnant pasture palms continuously bore flowers and fruits year-round, while forest palms flowered seasonally in isolated peaks with consecutive months of inactivity. Crown size and greater light exposure affected flowering and fruiting dynamics in A. phalerata and A. speciosa, respectively, and increased light availability shifted A. speciosa sex expression towards greater female investment, primarily through regulation of sex determination and bud abortion. Removal of tropical forest does not always lead to the downfall of remnant tree populations, and under favorable conditions, such as abandonment of cropland and pasture, higher levels of reproduction can facilitate recovery of future generations. Tree species with flexible sex expression may be particularly resilient in the face of land-use and land-cover change. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - The deforestation has led to local loss of species and important ecosystem services performed by them, causing ecological and economic losses. It is proposed that the reforestation of such areas aims to reduce those impacts. However, particularly in the tropics, little is known about the real success of different types of reforestation in the recovery of the species, and especially of the population parameters. Here we evaluated whether different types of reforestations affect Trypoxylon (Trypargilum) lactitarse Saussure (Hymenoptera: Crabronidae) in terms of abundance, percentage of emergence, proportion of males, fluctuating asymmetry, and foraging capacity. We compared primary forest (control) data to data collected in five different habitats: pasture, secondary forest, and tree plantations of Teak, Ficus, and a mixture of native species. The abundance of T. lactitarse was higher in tree plantations than in pasture. However, among the analyzed parameters, Teak plantation presented lower emergence percentage and the majority of individuals born were males. The emerged females in this habitat showed higher asymmetry and lower foraging capacity. Ficus showed lower individual abundance and mixed plantation showed lower emergence percentage, with both plantation types showing higher male emergence. On the other hand, in secondary forest, the analyzed parameters did not differ in relation to the primary forest, being the habitat more efficient in relation to those with tree planting. The changes in population parameters of T. lactitarse in different reforestations and particularly on Teak monocultures were probably attributed to indirect effects, such as low food availability and inadequate environmental conditions. © 2019, Sociedade Entomológica do Brasil.

AB  - This study is based on the hypothesis that unmanaged plantations of commercial species do not prevent understory colonization by native species. The research aimed to describe the floristic composition and structure of native arboreal species in the understory of a Corymbia citriodora stand. To this end, 112 plots (10 × 10 m; 1.12 ha) were installed. Six hundred native tree individuals distributed in 54 species, 44 genera, and 20 families were recorded. The regeneration diversity and evenness indices were 3.23 and 0.81, respectively. Native regeneration of C. citriodora understory shows features typical of semideciduous seasonal forests and seems to be at the early stage of regeneration. Results suggest that C. citriodora stands do not prevent understory colonization by native species. © 2019 FLORAM.

AB  - About half of the original one million km2 originally covered by the tropical dry forest of northeastern Brazil (known as “Caatinga”), has been deforested and replaced by crops and pastures. The remaining forest is constantly subjected to firewood removal. Besides that, pastures and cropping fields are often abandoned after a few years, allowing regeneration of secondary forest patches. These patterns create a mosaic of land use types and dry forest fragments under different regeneration stages, but there is little information about biogeochemical cycling in this ecosystem. Understanding the impacts of these changes, especially on carbon and nitrogen cycling, is important to define appropriate policies to preserve soils and vegetation and to contribute to reduce emissions and remove carbon from the atmosphere. Generating data about these processes require monitoring of large areas for long periods, and the use of models can be useful to improve the understanding of such systems. In the present study, the Century model was calibrated and validated to simulate the carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) dynamics in areas of caatinga vegetation before deforestation and during regeneration after abandonment. Calibration data were obtained in field plots in Paraiba state and validation data from plots Rio Grande do Norte state, both areas closely monitored for at least a couple of decades. Two types of deforestation practices were evaluated: clear cutting and cutting with stump removal followed by residue burning. The model files were prepared and calibration parameters were adjusted to represent observed values in the calibration site. Afterwards, the adjusted model was used to simulate the dynamics in the validation site, changing only the site soil and climate characteristics. In areas of preserved native vegetation, the validated C stock values of the woody vegetation biomass (21.0 Mg ha−1) were similar to the average values observed in the field (20.2 Mg ha−1). The soil organic carbon stock (SOC) (30 Mg ha−1) and its C:N ratio (11) were also satisfactorily validated by the Century model, indicating that the model can represent very closely the dynamics in areas under preserved forest vegetation. In areas under regeneration after deforestation, the model also represented well the C accumulation in the biomass of the secondary vegetation and the SOC dynamics for the different firewood harvest practices. The model is very sensitive to the type of deforestation, since the removal of the stumps slows down tree growth during regeneration, therefore it must be well detailed in the site management history during model runs. It is also important to create two different crop files for the herbaceous vegetation within the preserved forest or in the open deforested areas, because they comprise different vegetation types. The model was very sensitive to the KLAI variable, which controls the buildup of leaves during the young phase of the trees. After the necessary adaptations, the Century model simulated adequately C and N cycling in areas of Caatinga vegetation in the semi-arid region of Brazil. The model will now be a useful tool to better understand ecosystem functioning in this region. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Technical and scientific information on medium-term effects of post-logging silvicultural interventions on the recovery of harvestable growing stocks are hardly available. To mitigate uncertainties about these effects our study aimed to answer the following question: “What is the medium-term effect of post-harvest silvicultural treatments on mortality, growth, and the structure of commercial tree species in canopy logging gaps under tending and enrichment planting?” we study individuals planted and naturally regenerated in 72 logging gaps opened tree felling during reduced-impact logging among different silvicultural treatments: (1) natural regeneration tending (TNER); (2) enrichment planting in logging gaps (EP1); (3) enrichment planting in logging gaps previously cleaned of harvesting residuals (EP2). Mortality increased through time, EP1 presented the highest mortality rates of all treatments in the first, sixth and 11th year, TNER had the lowest at the same period. TNER and EP2 presented the highest basal area and EP2 the highest periodic annual increment. Effects of the silvicultural treatment TNER were positive, since it presented the highest survival and a high mean basal area of the initial trees. The medium-term effects of silvicultural treatments applied over individuals of commercial trees in logging gaps indicate higher survival and growth that reflected in the structure of treated individuals when compared to standard procedures of reduced impact-logging, these results bring positive outcomes to reach more sustainable future cutting cycles in the Brazilian Amazon and other tropical forests worldwide. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Understanding the relationships between Coffea arabica L and the native tree community of secondary forests regrowing after the abandonment of coffee plantations is important because, as a non-native species in the Neotropics, coffee can outcompete native species, reducing diversity and forests ecosystem services. We aimed to answer three questions: 1) Does coffee regeneration in secondary forests differ between shaded and unshaded abandoned plantations?; 2) How is coffee basal area related to structural attributes, species diversity and composition of the native community?; and 3) Do the relationships between coffee and native community differ between tree and sapling components? We sampled the tree and sapling components in a seasonal tropical dry forest that were previously used as shaded and unshaded coffee plantations. Coffee was the most important species in the sapling component of shaded systems, but was almost absent in unshaded ones. Coffee basal area was negatively related with the native density and absolute species richness of the sapling component; and was negatively related with tree density, and positively related with the percentage of pioneer individuals of the native tree component. Our results indicate that coffee persists in secondary forest communities even after more than 70 years of shaded-coffee plantations were abandoned, potentially reducing density and diversity of native species. Despite limitations, which hinder more general conclusions on coffee invasiveness in Brazilian secondary tropical forests, our results indicate that coffee is a strong competitor in the studied secondary forests and provide important insights for future research on this topic. © 2018 Raymundo et al.

AB  - The production of aluminum through the bauxite mining is an important economic activity for the State of Minas Gerais and Brazil. The greatest challenge of this activity is to achieve environmental sustainability. In the Southeastern region of Minas Gerais, known as "Zona da Mata," there are several bodies of bauxite ore, which have been exploited since 1992 by Brazilian Company of Aluminum - CBA (Companhia Brasileira de Alumínio). A peculiarity of this type of ore is about its occurrence, which is found usually in small patches of the landscape, especially in hilltops. These "patches" of bauxite occur at a medium depth of 4 meters and sometimes even in superficial outcrops, so the mineral extraction is very fast, ranging from one to a few months, which is a positive aspect to reduce the environmental impacts. In this scenario, the use of suitable techniques of forest restoration in mined areas has been carried out aiming at the environmental sustainability of the bauxite mining in the region. Thus, by monitoring of mined and restored areas, 146 native species of the Atlantic Forest were found, 61 in the planting of seedlings, 97 in the inventories for evaluation of these plantings and 92 in natural regeneration. It is important to note that some of these species are threatened with extinction in the forest patches of the region due to the history of fragmentation of the landscape by the pressure of agriculture and livestock. Another important result is about the seed dispersal syndromes, which revealed that 56.2% of all tree and shrub species are dispersed by animals. This means that these species are contributing to the attractiveness of the fauna, the natural enrichment and conservation of the restored forests in these areas. Therefore, it is possible to say that the established forest restoration program of the mined areas has been successful, making possible the return of native tree species in these areas. © 2020 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

AB  - Direct seeding is considered a feasible alternative for large-scale forest restoration, but little is known about the successional trajectory of tropical forests restored through direct seeding. To validate this method, we must understand how it changes forest structure and species richness and shapes the community trajectory as compared to the standard methods of natural regeneration and seedling planting. We evaluated restoration sites up to 10 years old in the Xingu river basin in Mato Grosso, Brazil. Our objectives were to: (i) describe changes in vegetation structure and richness in restored forests within the first decade; (ii) compare the outcome of restoration by direct seeding (broadcast seeding, sowing in rows, or placing seeds in holes) to seedling planting and natural regeneration; (iii) evaluate the influence of environmental variables (annual precipitation, soil phosphorus content, sand percentage, and soil base saturation) and the direct seeding technique on forest structure. We assessed species richness, density of individuals per size class, basal area, canopy height, aboveground biomass, and canopy cover. We sampled 72 direct-seeded sites between 1 and 10 years old, three seedling planting sites and six natural regeneration sites aged 7 to 9 years old. Community structure attributes changed over time, with the exception of the density of regenerating individuals. After four years, direct-seeded sites had formed a multi-layered canopy and were starting to be colonized by non-planted species. In general, direct-seeded sites had high aboveground biomass, but there was high variability among sites, especially after age six years. Sites with higher phosphorus content had more tree density, basal area, and biomass compared to the others. Broadcast seeding sites had higher seedling and sapling densities than sites that received other restoration methods. In conclusion, direct seeding was a successful method for the initial phase of forest restoration, promoting a structure that was more similar to resilient natural regeneration sites than to non-resilient natural regeneration sites and seedling planting sites. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Edaphic macrofauna must be better studied if we want to take advantage of their full potential for the restoration of tropical ecosystems. We investigated changes in edaphic macrofauna density and diversity along a secondary succession chronosequence in the Atlantic Forest. Our results show some clear patterns of change in soil macrofauna along the chronosequence. Density did not increase along secondary succession, but was correlated with canopy cover. Diversity was characterized by high dominance of social insects and evenness among other groups. We conclude soil macrofauna has a high capacity to recolonize young forests and that its recovery is considerably fast compared to other ecosystem transformations. © 2018, Instituto Internacional de Ecologia.

AB  - Forest regeneration in abandoned pastures in Amazonia has been well studied, but active restoration of non-resilient pastures has not. In this work, we evaluated large-scale active restoration of intensively used pastures in southern Amazonia, where the highest deforestation rates are observed. With the construction of the Jirau Dam in the Madeira river (state of Rondônia, Brazil), a 3000-ha forest buffer zone has been established. This area was previously covered by African pasture grasses for cattle ranching. Eight mixed-species planting sites with variable grass management and ranging from 6 to 60 months post-planting were measured three times over 2.5 years. We also tested a gradient of restoration intensity in an experimental planting: (i) no intervention (control), (ii) harrowing and herbicides to control grasses, and (iii) harrowing and herbicides plus tree planting. Our goals were to understand the initial trajectory of actively restored sites, the role of harrowing and herbicide application in triggering natural regeneration, and the role of seedling planting on the initial vegetation structure. All tree species ≥30 cm in height were sampled in five circular 10-m-radius plots per site. Plant cover was also monitored using the step-point method. At 18 months, stem density ranged from 2500 to 14,490 ind·ha−1, demonstrating that density increased suddenly in most sites through colonization, although this was highly variable. Tree cover reached 81% in five years, virtually eliminating grass cover after 36 months. Recruits contributed more to basal area than planted seedlings. Although 17 species, on average, were planted in restoration sites, the number of species at the sites steadily increased over time, at a rate of 7 species·yr−1 per 1570 m2. Cecropia spp. and Trema micrantha recruits had the highest stem densities and basal areas. Harrowing and grass control were enough to trigger succession in sites where natural regeneration was not taking place, shifting these sites to the highly resilient route of early secondary forest succession in the Amazon. Future restoration efforts should use a combination of methods, first evaluating the potential for natural regeneration and then gradually eliminating barriers. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Forest concessions were implemented in Brazil as a way to increase the areas of sustainable forest management. Little is known about the financial viability of forest management in Brazil, which is one of its main bottlenecks. In this context, the aim of the study was to evaluate the financial viability of an investment in forest concession. In order to do so, the Net Present Value (NPV), Periodic Equivalent Benefit (PEB), Internal Rate of Return (IRR) and Real Options Analysis (ROA) were adopted, and the option of abandonment was also analyzed. As a variable for ROA analysis, the productivity (m³.ha-1) at the first years of forest concession under study was adopted. The NPV of the investment corresponds to US$ 8.04.m-³, the PEB was US$ 0.52.m-³.year-1 and the IRR, 20.75%. In order to be considered feasible, the forest concession must have a minimum productivity of 17.75 m³.ha-1. Of the 861 managerial decisions, the option to proceed with the investment was adopted in 237 nodes (27.53%), and the decision to abandon was exercised in 624 nodes (72.47%). This is a worrying result for the concessionaire companies and also for the management entities of the forest concessions, mainly when comparing with the concessions reality, where abandonment is an option that has been performed. It can be concluded that the high probability of abandoning highlights a fragility of forest concessions. ROA proved to be a good methodology to complement traditional methods of financial analysis, presenting satisfactory results in aiding decision-making. © 2019, Federal University of Lavras.

AB  - Aims: Assessing the role of a dominant native bamboo species on tree species diversity and structure in the medium term. Methods: Over a 7-year period, we studied the natural regeneration of two dominant forest types in Southern Brazil (Araucaria Forest or AF; Bamboo Forest or BF) after a bamboo (Merostachys skvortzovii Send.) die-off between 2004 and 2006. The study was carried out in the Embrapa Research Station in Caçador, Santa Catarina State, Brazil. Important Findings: The die-off provided ideal conditions for the establishment of several species and it kickstarted forest succession dynamics, which in turn affected regeneration diversity. Tree species richness was relatively stable with a transitory increase between 2007 and 2014 in both AF and BF. However, species richness rose in BF because of a relative increase in abundance of some species (especially late and secondary species) while a plunge in some pioneer species drove an increase in diversity. Overall, we found that BF has a lower diversity of recruits and that density declined over time, while AF is more diverse, with a more stable density. In BF, the bamboo die-off created optimal conditions for initial regeneration development (mainly fast-growing pioneer trees), which quickly transited to higher size classes. Yet, after this initial stage of pioneer recruitment, the number of recruits dropped followed by a virtual absence of growth regardless of the species group as a result of a quick bamboo reestablishment. As bamboo recreated a dense understory it reduced species diversity to original levels, suggesting a self-maintaining cycle that halts forest succession. On the other hand, the bamboo die-off had little impact on AF where a slow recruitment process typical of old-growth forests was observed. The results indicate that the die-off event had a temporary effect on species diversity i.e. restricted to forests where bamboos are dominant in a similar process described in other southern South American forests. As the first study to observe the medium-term forest dynamics related to bamboo die-off, we can conclude that when being dominant, native bamboos can hinder forest regeneration, maintaining lower levels of diversity and arresting forest succession that lasts well beyond the short-term, post-die-off effects. Many forest fragments in the region are dominated by bamboos, thus their potential for conservation is at risk and requires appropriate management. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - Climate change is expected to impact the hydrological regime worldwide, and land use and land cover change may alter the effects of the former in some cases. Secondary growth in deforested and abandoned areas is one of the main consequences of land use and cover changes in Amazonia. Among land uses, the effects of the secondary growth in water availability in large scale basins are not well understood. This work analyzes the potential effects of secondary growth under climate and land use change on water availability and hydropower in the Tocantins basin, in the Legal Amazon region of Brazil, using the MHD-INPE hydrological model driven by different climate scenarios and two future socioeconomic-based potential land use scenarios. The model projects decrease on discharge under climate change scenarios, which further cause the simulated hydropower energy potential to decrease significantly. When only deforestation scenarios are included, the effects of climate change are weakened, but when secondary growth is also considered, the effects of climate change are enhanced. Results suggest that different aspects of environmental change, such as secondary growth, may affect water production and the sectors depending on it. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The aim of this research was to relate natural vegetation dynamics to environmental policies and agricultural pressure surrounding the Irati National Forest (INF), in the state of Parana, Brazil. We mapped landuses and detected their changes over a period of 25 years (1992 to 2017), emphasising gains and losses of natural vegetation to other uses. Employing a pixel-based approach, Landsat-5 TM and Landsat-8 OLI data were used to classify landuse surrounding the INF. We reviewed records of agricultural expansion and environmental policies in Parana to explain losses and gains in vegetation cover detected in the landuse change analysis. During the study period the area surrounding the INF gained ~10,000 ha of natural vegetation cover regenerated from areas formerly under crop or pasture cover and planted forests, but lost ~20,000 ha, largely to agricultural expansion, likely for soybeans. We discuss environmental policies, particularly the Ecological ICMS (a Brazilian ecological fiscal incentive paid to counties that shelter protected areas) as the most important reason for the vegetation regeneration and nature conservation. © Forest Research Institute Malaysia

AB  - Long-term ecological success of large-scale restoration programs planned for the next decades will rely on genetic diversity (GD) of reintroduced or colonizing species, a limiting factor in highly fragmented landscapes. In small and isolated natural remnants or restoration areas, substantial reduction in population's size or connectivity may lead to local extinctions due to the accumulation of deleterious recessive alleles and ongoing reduction of fecundity, plant vigor, recruitment success, and adaptive potential. Despite the paramount role of GD for species persistence, its levels in restoration programs are poorly known. We assessed the GD of four model tree species (different succession stages, dispersal, and pollination syndromes) from the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, comparing two high-diversity restoration plantations, one forest fragment and one conserved remnant. Contrary to the expectation that the plantation strategies adopted in the restoration programs could result in genetic composition homogenization, we found that restoration areas established heterogeneous genetic groups with similar levels of neutral GD and inbreeding to those observed in natural forest remnants. This pattern was consistent across the four functionally different tree species, despite some species idiosyncrasies. For instance, we observed lower allelic richness in early successional species in restoration sites, suggesting that some species may be more prone to reintroduction with lower GD. Thus, we advocate the use of high GD levels in restoration to support biodiversity conservation in human-modified landscapes, thus reinforcing the role of ecological restoration for recovering the diversity of genes—the basic constituent of biodiversity. © 2017 Society for Ecological Restoration

AB  - The natural regeneration process is essential for forest maintenance since it is critical for establishing new tree individuals. This study aimed to improve the understanding of the regenerative component dynamics of Araucaria Forests in Southern Brazil. We investigated the effects of climate, light, tree component structure and anthropogenic disturbance on tree species regeneration. Regenerating communities from six different fragments in forest remnants of the “Planalto Sul Catarinense” region was evaluated in permanent plots two years after the first inventory. The following demographic rates were determined: recruitment, mortality, net change in the number of individuals and the changes to both upper and lower height classes. The following variables were measured in each fragment: altitude, climatic variables, light environment, tree component density and cattle presence. Association between dynamics rates, regenerating species abundance and explanatory variables was verified by the fourth-corner and RLQ methods. A total of 4,379 and 5,268 individuals were sampled for the first and second inventories, respectively, with recruitment rate (21 % yr-1) higher than mortality rate (13 % yr-1). The dynamics pattern of the fragment with greater presence of cattle stood out for the intense height increase of regenerating species caused by the presence of fast growth and light-demanding species. Natural regeneration of forest remnants under study is facing a structuring process. The main conclusions of this study were: i) climate and altitude play a relevant role in defining floristic identity and ii) chronic disturbances may influence the definition of ecological strategies. © 2019, Scientia Agricola.

AB  - In Rio Grande do Sul, Southern Brazil, there are hundreds of Eucalyptus forest farms for pulp production distributed in several municipalities. In these pulpwood production farms, a major forestry restoration project is underway for Permanent Preservation Areas, which have peculiarities that may favor or hinder restoration. In this compilation, in order to search for alternatives for the restoration of these Permanent Preservation Areas, the planting of seedlings of native species in nuclei is implemented and evaluated as an alternative technique to traditional reforestation with total area plantation. Suitable techniques for forest restoration in mined areas are also explored, with the goal of attaining environmental sustainability for the bauxite mining in the region. Thus, by monitoring of mined and restored areas, 146 native species of the Atlantic Forest were found, 61 in the planting of seedlings, 97 in the inventories for evaluation of these plantings and 92 in natural regeneration. The authors set out to elucidate the underlying processes modeled by diversity and community composition with respect to aboveground biomass during succession in an Amazon forest in order to devise better passive restoration plans. 45 20m × 50m (1000 m2) plots were sampled across three sites in secondary forests, having different stand ages after shifting cultivation, and an old-growth forest located in the Northern Amazon forest, Venezuela. One study discusses how, due to the environmental heterogeneity conditions, active restoration measures are fundamental in degraded areas where natural regeneration is limited, mainly due to the absence of fragments in the landscape. Finally, it is emphasized that passive restoration is playing an important role in the ecosystem services recovery at local-scale. In the penultimate study, the authors compare the floristic composition and structure of the natural regeneration stratum of a 23-year-old restored forest with an adjacent dense ombrophilous forest. For this purpose, 60 plots with dimensions of 3×3 m (9m) were equally and systematically distributed in these two areas. All shrub-tree individuals with height =30 cm and circumference at breast height <15 cm in these plots were included and their heights and diameter at ground level were measured. Lastly, the dynamics of soil use and coverage in a region under the influence of mining activities are explored. This region is located in Minas Gerais state, more specifically in the municipalities of São Sebastião da Vargem Alegre and Miraí, both located in Zona da Mata Mineira. © 2020 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

AB  - The low natural regeneration of the Brazil nut (Bertholletia excelsa) in the Madre de Dios region of Peru is a major concern for the conservation and sustainable use of this species which sustains one of the cornerstone non-timber forest product economies in Amazonia. The Brazil nut is a gap-dependent, long-lived pioneer species that has been shown to regenerate more effectively in fallows than in mature forests. Aside from light and nutrient availability, recruitment success of the species might also be influenced by conspecific negative distance-dependent (CNDD) processes as shown for a myriad of other tropical tree species, but to date has not been studied in the Brazil nut. We measured Brazil nut recruitment in forty 150 × 10 m2 transects (totaling 6 ha), proportionally laid out in mature forest and fallow land. We found a higher likelihood of regeneration in fallows than in mature forest, which was mainly due to more successful transitioning from seedlings to saplings in fallows. Recruitment rates in fallows increased with the number of fire events occurring over the past 12 years, largely owing to the accumulation of resprouting individuals, but this positive correlation was only observed up to three fire events. We observed CNDD recruitment of the Brazil nut in fallows but not in mature forest, suggesting that pests and diseases might also condition Brazil nut recruitment. Our findings suggest that a better management of fallow land and more controlled use of fire in neighboring land uses could be a cost-effective manner to create Brazil nut rich forests through natural regeneration. On the other hand, the absence of high density Brazil nut stands in mature forests in Madre de Dios might mean that the impact of ancient humans there has been more limited than in other Amazonian regions. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This study aimed to describe the floristic composition of the regenerative component and to relate it with the adult component of an Araucaria Forest fragment, in South Brazil, in order to infer about the process of tree species community assemblage. To do so, five 10 x 20 m transection were allocated, in a forest fragment located at municipality of Lages, SC state. Each transect was made up by five plots, 20 m from each other, subdivided in different sizes, according to the sampled size class. The adult and regenerative components were compared each other for floristic-structural organization (Permutational Multivariate Analysis of Variance and Indicator Species Analysis), richness (rarefaction), population, individual spatial distribution (Standardized Morisita Index), and pattern of species coexistence or segregation in the studied plots (C-score Index). The results demonstrated significant differences between adults and regenerating components in relation to floristic-structural similarity and to richness. The adult component presented a greater proportion of populations with a random spatial distribution; and a smaller coexistence of species in plots than the regenerative component. We infer that the tree community assemblage is under influence of different ecological process, which intensity is ontogenetic dependent. © 2018, Universidade Federal de Santa Maria.

AB  - Climbers are an important life form in the understory and canopy of tropical forests. They are characterised by constant root connection to the ground and use of other species, mainly trees, as support in their search for higher light. In addition, they have an important role in ecological succession in forest clearings, as they are able to develop rapidly in these environments. Climbers can have high species richness in the biomes in which they are present. Since climbers are of little economic importance, they are usually cut down without regard for their contribution to maintenance of biodiversity and to the structure of the forest. Floristic studies of climbers in Brazil are still scarce and more research is needed. The goal of our research was to develop a floristic survey and identification keys for the climbers of the Estação Ecológica de Assis (EEA) in the cerrado biome of São Paulo state, Brazil. Sampling was carried out every two weeks over ten months, along trails and edges of forest within the EEA. Identification keys were built based on vegetative characters. Thirty-two climber species, belonging to 24 genera and 13 families were recorded. The families with the largest number of species were Bignoniaceae (8 species), Malpighiaceae (5), Apocyn-aceae (3) and Smilacaceae (3). The richest genera were Fridericia (4 species), Banisteriopsis (3) and Smilax (3). The number of species recorded for the forest fragment reveals the important role of climbers in the diversity of forested savannahs ("cerradões") in the State of São Paulo. © Nicácio Ribeiro Neto et al.

AB  - Defining the reference system for restoration projects in regions characterized by complex vegetation mosaics is challenging. Here we use the Cerrado region of Brazil as an example of the importance of clearly defining multiple natural and anthropogenically altered states in grassland-savanna-forest mosaics. We define three main, natural vegetation types–grassland, savanna, and scleromorphic (cerradão) forest–to (1) distinguish between original and degraded states and (2) set appropriate targets for and guide restoration. We contend that the differences in Cerrado vegetation composition originally were driven by soil conditions and secondarily by fire frequency and precipitation patterns that differ from the core to the edge of the Cerrado region. Grasslands are found on the shallowest, least fertile soils and/or in waterlogged soils; scleromorphic forests are generally located on deeper, more fertile soils; and savannas occupy an intermediate position. In recent decades, this biophysical template has been overlain by a range of human land-use intensities that strongly affect resilience, resulting in alternative anthropogenic states. For example, areas that were originally scleromorphic forest are likely to regenerate naturally following low- or medium-intensity land use due to extensive resprouting of woody plants, whereas grassland restoration requires reintroduction of grass and forb species that do not tolerate soil disturbance and exotic grass competition. Planting trees into historic grasslands results in inappropriate restoration targets and often restoration failure. Correctly identifying original vegetation types is critical to most effectively allocate scarce restoration funding. © 2019 Society for Ecological Restoration

AB  - Mechanisms of natural regeneration are fundamental for ecological function restoration in forest fragments and degraded areas. The present work aimed to evaluate the seed rain and the establishment of seedlings of arboreal species in the Atlantic Forest, located in the northeast of Brazil. For sampling of the seed rain, 60 collectors were allocated (area of 0.196 m²), being equidistant, approximately, 50 m. The samples were collected at intervals of 30 days for a period of 12 months. To evaluate the establishment of seedlings, subplots were allocated next to the collectors, totaling 60 subplots of 0.25 m² each. The arboreal individuals identified by the diaspores collected in the seed rain and by the seedlings established in the fragment were counted and classified for the dispersion syndrome and successional group. The seed rain was represented by 60 morphospecies and 20 botanical families. The ecological group and the predominant dispersion syndrome were of early secondary and zoocoric species, respectively. In relation to the established seedlings, 122 seedlings were counted, being Tapirira guianensis L. with higher number of seedlings. The rainfall of seeds presents potential for the maintenance of the forest dynamics due to the high species richness that compose the current vegetation. Being predominantly composed of species that produce abundant fruits with zoocoric dispersion that serve as food for fauna. While few seeds germinate to form the seedling bank, most of them are contributing to seed bank formation. © 2018, Universidade Federal de Santa Maria. All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper presents innovative methods for using satellite image time series to produce land use and land cover classification over large areas in Brazil from 2001 to 2016. We used Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) time series data to classify natural and human-transformed land areas in the state of Mato Grosso, Brazil's agricultural frontier. Our hypothesis is that building high-dimensional spaces using all values of the time series, coupled with advanced statistical learning methods, is a robust and efficient approach for land cover classification of large data sets. We used the full depth of satellite image time series to create large dimensional spaces for statistical classification. The data consist of MODIS MOD13Q1 time series with 23 samples per year per pixel, and 4 bands (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), near-infrared (nir) and mid-infrared (mir)). By taking a series of labelled time series, we fed a 92-dimensional attribute space into a support vector machine model. Using a 5-fold cross validation, we obtained an overall accuracy of 94% for discriminating among nine land cover classes: forest, cerrado, pasture, soybean-fallow, fallow-cotton, soybean-cotton, soybean-corn, soybean-millet, and soybean-sunflower. Producer and user accuracies for all classes were close to or better than 90%. The results highlight important trends in agricultural intensification in Mato Grosso. Double crop systems are now the most common production system in the state, sparing land from agricultural production. Pasture expansion and intensification has been less studied than crop expansion, although it has a stronger impact on deforestation and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Our results point to a significant increase in the stocking rate in Mato Grosso and to the possible abandonment of pasture areas opened in the state's frontier. The detailed land cover maps contribute to an assessment of the interplay between production and protection in the Brazilian Amazon and Cerrado biomes. © 2018 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

AB  - A high level of variation of biodiversity recovery within a landscape during forest restoration presents obstacles to ensure large-scale, cost-effective and long-lasting ecological restoration. There is an urgent need to predict landscape variation in forest restoration success at a global scale. We conducted a meta-analysis comprising 135 study landscapes to predict and map landscape variation in forest restoration success in tropical and temperate forest biomes. Our analysis was based on the amount of forest cover within a landscape — a key driver of forest restoration success. We contrasted 17 generalized linear models measuring forest cover at different landscape sizes (with buffers varying from 5 to 200 km radii). We identified the most plausible model to predict and map landscape variation in forest restoration success. We then weighted landscape variation by the amount of potentially restorable areas (agriculture and pasture land areas) within the same landscape. Finally, we estimated restoration costs of implementing Bonn Challenge commitments in three specific temperate and tropical forest biome types in the United States, Brazil and Uganda. Landscape variation decreased exponentially as the amount of forest cover increased in the landscape, with stronger effects within a 5 km radius. Thirty-eight per cent of forest biomes have landscapes with more than 27% of forest cover and showed levels of landscape variation below 10%. Landscapes with less than 6% of forest cover showed levels of variation in forest restoration success above 50%. At the biome level, Tropical and Subtropical Moist Broadleaf Forests had the lowest (12.6%), whereas Tropical and Subtropical Dry Broadleaf Forests had the highest (22.9%) average of weighted landscape variation in forest restoration success. Our approach can lead to a reduction in implementation costs for each Bonn Challenge commitment between US$ 973 Mi and 9.9 Bi. Policy implications. Our approach identifies landscape characteristics that increase the likelihood of biodiversity recovery during forest restoration — and potentially the chances of natural regeneration and long-term ecological sustainability and functionality. Identifying areas with low levels of landscape variation can help to reduce the risks and financial costs associated with implementing ambitious restoration commitments. © 2019 The Authors.

AB  - Bamboos are opportunistic species that rapidly colonize open areas following forest disturbance, forming dense clusters that alter the regenerative processes and maintain lower levels of tree diversity. Widespread forest degradation, especially in Latin America and Asia, and human-induced introduction have allowed native and non-native bamboo species to thrive, hindering successional pathways that would otherwise lead to more diverse forests; such a large-scale phenomenon is a key concern in the conservation of forest resources around the globe. Despite previous research on this phenomenon, little is known about the long-term effects of bamboo dominance on forest structure and composition and the corresponding interaction with natural regeneration. As such, we sought to evaluate the long-term effects of bamboo dominance on the dynamics of adult forest populations considering two forest types (Bamboo Forest—BF and Araucaria Forest—AF) over an 11-year period in the Embrapa Research Station in Caçador, Brazil. We monitored 20 plots (15 × 15 m) in each forest type where we tagged, identified, and measured the height and diameter of all the trees taller than 1.5 m (H) and diameter at breast height (DBH) greater than 3.18 cm. Comparisons were based on forest species diversity and structure parameters. In BF, diversity of species increased after the bamboo die-off that occurred in 2006 with a subsequent reduction in the number of pioneer species overtime. However, secondary species remained stagnant demonstrating that recruitment and transition into higher size classes is restricted to the immediate die-off aftermath. On the other hand, plant diversity and structure in the relatively bamboo-free AF were stable with secondary species accounting for the most richness. Our results confirm that BF maintains significantly lower levels of diversity that are restricted to pioneer species; AF structure and diversity are not significantly affected by bamboo die-off and recolonization; and BF tree species are caught in a closed cycle of arrested successional development. The widespread presence of bamboos as dominant species in the region should become a part of the conversation pertaining to forest management and conservation in Brazil and other countries in south America and Asia. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Background: We investigated local knowledge of plants in terms of plant use shifts and losses, in two coastal communities within a protected area in southern Brazil. Our hypothesis is that people's livelihoods are associated with different ethnobotanical knowledge, and changes in these activities can reflect shifts in ethnobotanical knowledge such as stopping using some plants. Methods: We interviewed 125 inhabitants after prior informed consent, asking her/him about their socioeconomic profile and to free list the plants they know. The free lists were analyzed by frequency of cited plants. To compare averages of cited plants and age in both communities, we used the Wilcoxon test with a significance of 5%. Spearman correlation was tested with number of plants cited in the past and the interviewees' age. Permanence and change in economic activities in each community were represented using a graph and compared through a chi-squared test with a significance of 5%. Qualitative analyses of the interviews and a field diary were used to analyze driving forces for the abandonment of used plants. Results: We identified 231 plant species that were currently used mainly for food and medicine. Despite being in a protected area, most of the cited plants were exotic and cultivated in home gardens. We do not confirm the hypothesis that changes in livelihoods are reflected in the plants used; however, qualitative analyses showed potential drivers for shifts and losses of plant use. "Environmental law" and "protected area" were the drivers most related to the abandonment of plant use. Conclusions: While recognizing the importance of the protected area to maintain local people and their traditions, we documented a shift in plant use that is mainly correlated to construction activities that disappeared from daily practices. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - Aquatic contamination by potentially toxic metals is a problem that has been aggravated, especially due to the quantity and the diversity of sources. Locating these sources is not always an easy task, especially because of the wide variety of possibilities. In this context, the application of geostatistical methods may represent an excellent tool to find out sources of metal contaminants in aquatic systems. Thus, the objective of this work was to elaborate an approach to identify sources of potentially toxic metals (Zn, Ba, Pb, Cr, Mn and Fe), by relating their spatial–temporal variations with the local land use patterns, along a longitudinal profile of the Pirapora River, located in the State of Sao Paulo, Brazil. For this purpose, water samples were collected at different points, taking into consideration each specific land use pattern and quantifying the metals contents by microwave plasma atomic emission spectrometry. In this work, thirteen land use patterns have been identified: mining, forestry, abandoned pasture, water, urban area, human occupation, floodplain, bare soil, temporary crop, roads, forest, streets and pasture. The results revealed temporal variations for the metals Ba, Cr, Fe, and Pb and spatial for Zn and Mn, making possible to correlate the presence of these two latter metals with mining and forestry, the most proeminent activities in the region. Overall, this work proposes a model which brings together geoprocessing and analytical methods, in order to correlate spatial–temporal variations of potentially toxic metals with specific land use patterns of a determined region, aiming the environmental monitoring. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - Cerrado is the second-largest Brazilian biome and an important area for nature conservation. However, little is known about the distribution of forest species in anthropized areas undergoing natural regeneration. Understanding the dynamics of ecological succession is fundamental to the decision-making process regarding revegetation of anthropic areas in the Cerrado. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate the phytosociological patterns of natural regeneration in areas anthropized by agricultural uses in the Cerrado in different soil and environmental conditions. For this purpose, the study was performed in an anthropized area that has been protected from anthropic actions since 2002. A floristic survey of forest species was carried out, and soil samples were collected at depths of 0–5, 5–10, and 10–20 cm to determine the physical and chemical properties of the soil. The distribution of forest species with respect to the soil characteristics was determined using multivariate analysis. The distribution of the forest species was shown to be influenced by the soil properties and the degree of succession of the vegetation. Furthermore, the natural regeneration process resulted in an improvement in the chemical properties of soils in the Gleysol class. This pattern is related to the slow decomposition of organic matter, being associated with an environment that has greater water availability and, consequently, less nutrient loss from leaching during the cycling mechanisms responsible for the return of nutrients to the soil. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - Dryland tropical forests are important but little-understood ecosystems. These landscapes are at risk globally because of accelerated deforestation and the consequent losses of hydrological functions. An example is the Caatinga shrublands in northeastern Brazil; these dry tropical forests are undergoing rapid change as the land is converted to cultivated cropland and pastureland and then often abandoned after the land is exhausted, allowing forests to regrow. In this study, we evaluated how these changes influence soil hydraulic properties and soil erosion in Caatinga landscapes, by examining four sites of different ages: a recently abandoned pasture, a young (7 years of regrowth) secondary forest, an intermediate (35 years of regrowth) secondary forest, and an older (more than 55 years) forest. Rainfall simulation was used to assess soil infiltrability and susceptibility to erosion. In addition, we determined hydrological conductivity in the field using the Beerkan method (Kfs) and collected samples for laboratory-determined measurements (Ks). We found that infiltrability and Kfs values were progressively higher as time since land abandonment increased, whereas Ks values were not significantly different across sites. Infiltrability was approximately 2 times smaller than Ks and Kfs—possibly owing to the formation of soil crusts from raindrop impact. Soil erosion did not show a progressive improvement with forest age and was better explained by site characteristics, such as herbaceous cover and slope. In general, our results suggest that in Caatinga landscapes, more than 35 years is required for the recovery of soil hydraulic properties following land abandonment.

AB  - Bats play a fundamental role in ecosystem functioning since they are responsible for several ecological services such as seed dispersal and pollination. Therefore, assessing the effects of habitat structure at different scales on the bat assemblage is extremely important for supporting conservation strategies. The objective of the present study was to investigate the effects of habitat structure at multiple spatial scales on the bat assemblages and their variation along a gradient of secondary succession in a Brazilian tropical dry forest. Our results suggest that bat abundance is higher in areas close to mature forests, which shows the important role of those habitats as refuges for the regional bat fauna (in a fragmented landscape) and for the maintenance of ecosystem services provided by this group in tropical dry forests in a landscape context. In addition, bat abundance was lower in protected areas whose surroundings were better preserved (greater forest extension). This unexpected finding could result from an altered behavior in areas under a strong influence of a fruit crop matrix. Finally, we showed that the effects of the surroundings depend on the successional stage of the area under analysis. Late forests are more susceptible to variations in the forest cover in their surroundings, which show the higher fragility of these environments. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - The nutrient cycling is influenced by the successional stage. However, there is disagreement in relation to the pattern of this dynamic. The present study aimed to evaluate the chemical attributes of the topsoil and litterfall in two abandoned plantations of the eucalyptus Corymbia citriodora in different stages of Atlantic Rainforest succession (PJ: young plantation; PM: mature plantation) at the União Biological Reserve, RJ. We tested the hypothesis that there is an increase in the nutrient contents in the topsoil and litterfall, the amount of litterfall and nutrient input to the soil, as the process of forest succession advances. We sampled the topsoil (depth of 0-10 cm; dry season/2008, rainy season/2008, dry season/2009, rainy season/2010) and litterfall (0.49 m2 traps; 1.0 m above the forest floor; twice a month; 366 days) in five plots (5 m x 20 m) in the areas of PJ and PM. The topsoil in the PM area presented higher content of total C and N, H + Al, and Mn. On the other hand, the values of pH, C/N ratio and content of K, Fe, and Zn were higher in the topsoil in the PJ area. No clear pattern was detected in terms of the P and Cu content in the topsoil. The annual litterfall was higher in the PM area, which presented higher content of total N and Mg, while higher C/N ratio and content of both P and Ca occurred in the PJ area. We did not detect differences in terms of total C in litterfall. The input of C, N, P, K and Mg to the soil were higher by litterfall in the area of PM, and there were no differences between PJ and PM in relation to the Ca input. We partly corroborated the tested hypothesis in relation to the nutrient content in topsoil, litterfall and nutrient input, and we completely corroborated the hypothesis in terms of litterfall. © 2018, Universidade Federal de Santa Maria.

AB  - The edaphic macrofauna may reflect changes in soil use. This study aimed to answer two questions: (1) Has the management of eucalyptus by girdling, promote stimulation or inhibition in the guilds of the edaphic macrofauna? (2) Can soil macrofauna be used as an indicator of the recovery of abandoned eucalyptus areas? For that purpose, we compared the composition and diversity of the edaphic macrofauna in areas of secondary forest, abandoned non-girdled eucalyptus plantations and girdled eucalyptus plantations. The secondary forest presented greater richness, abundance and diversity of edaphic macrofauna, followed by areas of girdled eucalyptus, with the lowest values found in areas with non-girdled eucalyptus. Therefore, the edaphic macrofauna responded to the management by girdling, through the stimulation of the taxonomic groups in the different guilds and can be indicated as a good indicator of the recovery of disturbed areas. © 2019 Universidade Federal Rural do Rio de Janeiro (UFRRJ).

AB  - This study aimed to evaluate stump regrowth and estimate the reconstitution of shrub-tree biomass from the stumps in an area of Caatinga under forest management in Floresta-PE, Brazil. The circumferences and heights of the stump and sprouts were measured two years after an intervention on 18 plots. The influence of the stump diameter and its height on the sprouting ability of the species was evaluated. Data was taken in the next area without intervention in order to estimate the diameter at breast height for reconstitution of the exploited biomass. We found that the tillering for Poincianella bracteosa and Aspidosperma pyrifolium was influenced by the size of the circumference, but not by the stump height. The average estimated biomass (17186.16 kg ha-1) was similar to other areas also subject to human intervention, and its reconstitution can be an auxiliary tool for monitoring illegal deforestation by environmental agencies. © 2018 University of Sao Paolo.

AB  - The expansion of human-altered landscapes affects biodiversity on every continent. In the Cerrado biodiversity hotspot of central Brazil, Eucalyptus plantations increasingly claim large tracts of native habitats thanks to favorable soils, climate and booming pulp firm profits. Yet, the highs and lows of the economy including government incentives over the years riddled the landscape with abandoned plantations, which are not subject to active restoration. Despite the well-documented pattern anthropogenic disturbances negatively affect Cerrado biodiversity, little is known about the processes driving species co-existence within these abandoned plantations. Herein, we use phylogenetic community structure indices to test if potential processes assembling lizard communities differ between undisturbed Cerrado habitats and disturbed abandoned Eucalyptus plantations; and if so, are these processes predictable. In addition, we explore the applicability of phylogenetic community structure indices as ecological indicators of anthropogenic disturbance in the Cerrado biodiversity hotspot. We address these questions at a local scale, recording lizard species richness and abundance along transects of undisturbed Cerrado and adjacent disturbed abandoned Eucalyptus plantations. Morphological measurements were collected from captured lizards to test for trait conservatism. We investigated if phylogenetic community structure is altered in a predictable manner by comparing (i) phylogenetic species variability, (ii) phylogenetic species richness and (iii) phylogenetic species evenness. To test for significant differences between undisturbed and disturbed communities, we performed two-tailed paired t-tests for each phylogenetic community index. We also test for phylogenetic clustering and overdispersion to determine if potential processes assembling lizard communities differ between undisturbed and disturbed communities. Furthermore, we compare phylogenetic community structure indices to other commonly used diversity indices (taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic diversity) to evaluate their applicability as ecological indicators of anthropogenic disturbance in the Cerrado. We demonstrated phylogenetic clustering in two out of three of the undisturbed Cerrado lizard communities supporting habitat filtering as the potential dominant assembly process; whereas 67% of the disturbed Eucalyptus communities showed phylogenetic overdispersion supporting competition as the potential predominate assembly process. This indicates anthropogenic disturbance, in the form of abandoned Eucalyptus plantations, may alter phylogenetic community structure in a predictable manner, leading to the loss of closely related species in the disturbed plantation forests. The highly endemic biota of the Cerrado is composed of closely related species that share similar traits for survival, most likely a consequence of frequent episodic fires during the dry season. Interestingly, phylogenetic community structure indices and diversity indices did not converge on the same disturbed site to prioritize for active restoration; thereby, providing a cautionary tale on the applicability of the indices as ecological indicators for the Cerrado biodiversity. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - With the intensification of global warming, the occurrence of large-scale natural events is becoming even more common in tropical regions, which can impact the structure of plant communities. In this study, we evaluated the isolated and combined effects of an extratropical cyclone and the dominance of a native bamboo species (Merostachys skvortzovii) on floristic composition, diversity, demographic rates and the increment of trees in Atlantic Forest fragments in Southern Brazil. In 2014 (T1) and 2016 (T2), we sampled 56 plots of 200 m² for the effects of an extratropical cyclone in 2009 (T0). We also evaluated another 60 plots of the same size not in the direct path of this cyclone. Half of the plots in each group were covered by dense groupings of bamboos, as a result of past human activities, which could potentially limit natural regeneration. We observed an increase in richness and diversity indices (H′ and 1/D) from the first (T0) to the following assessments (T1 an T2) on the sites affected by the cyclone, when compared to non-affected sites. After the cyclone, both density and basal area they decreased, but there was an increase in recruitment, mortality, turnover rates and basal area, as well as basal increment. The diameter increment on surviving individuals was higher in cyclone-affected sites than in non-affected sites. Bamboo cover did not affect richness or demographic rates (except mortality between T0 and T1). Natural impacts of this nature can lead to significant alterations of demographic rates, allowing the input of new species and influencing the pace of demographic processes. © 2019 Ecological Society of Australia

AB  - In this pioneering study, we evaluated variables that may influence the occupancy and detections (here interpreted as a proxy of intensity or frequency of use) probabilities of cattle and donkeys in a protected area in the Caatinga dry forest biome. No variable influenced the occupancy probability of cattle, which was high and constant at all sampled sites. Conversely, the occupancy probability of donkeys was positively correlated with the distance from the nearest ranch, which might be explained by the fact that donkeys are feral in our study area and thus, avoid areas inhabited by humans. The detection probability of both species was strongly influenced by the type of habitat, with the shrubby arboreal Caatinga being used more intensively by both species than riparian forests. The presence of cattle and donkeys within the protected area may represent a severe threat to the local biotas. This area is currently dominated by secondary successional habitats, resulting from the extensive degradation of its vegetation prior to the establishment of the protected area, and the incursions of these domestic animals may hamper the recuperation of native habitats, as well as jeopardize the survival of its native species, reduce water quality, and erode ecosystem services. We believe that studies of this type are essential and that the data they produce should be considered in the development of the management plans for protected areas to minimize the impacts of these exotic species on the native fauna and flora of Brazilian biomes. © 2019 Associação Brasileira de Ciência Ecológica e Conservação

AB  - Although the impacts of climate change on biodiversity are increasing worldwide, few studies have attempted to forecast these impacts on Amazon Tropical Forest. In this study, we estimated the impact of climate change on Amazonian avian assemblages considering range shifts, species loss, vulnerability of ecosystem functioning, future effectiveness of current protected areas and potential climatically stable areas for conservation actions. Species distribution modelling based on two algorithms and three different scenarios of climate change was used to forecast 501 avian species, organized on main ecosystem functions (frugivores, insectivores and nectarivores) for years 2050 and 2070. Considering the entire study area, we estimated that between 4 and 19% of the species will find no suitable habitat. Inside the currently established protected areas, species loss could be over 70%. Our results suggest that frugivores are the most sensitive guild, which could bring consequences on seed dispersal functions and on natural regeneration. Moreover, we identified the western and northern parts of the study area as climatically stable. Climate change will potentially affect avian assemblages in southeastern Amazonia with detrimental consequences to their ecosystem functions.

AB  - The development of the mangrove in Ceará state, northeastern Brazil, is limited by local environmental and climatic factors, associated with the variables that determine the region's semi-arid climatic conditions. The same conditions also contribute to the installation of artisanal saltworks in estuarine environments. The artisanal production of salt peaked in the 20th century, but with the decline of this activity, the salt evaporation ponds were abandoned, and have been incorporated back into the natural marine-estuarine environment and colonized by mangrove forests. In the early 2000s, however, the expansion of shrimp farming operations impacted this same environment. The present study was based on a spatiotemporal analysis of the natural regeneration of the mangrove vegetation in abandoned salt pond areas in the Brazilian semi-arid region between 1968 and 2009. The integrated analysis of mangrove ecosystem dynamics and the legislation that regulates the licensing of these economic activities identified a number of technical problems in the formulation and execution of the COEMA resolution 02/2002, which permits the installation of shrimp farms in areas dominated by the mangrove. The findings of the present study reinforce the need for a careful reformulation of the Ceará state environmental legislation, in order to guarantee the maximum possible conservation of the coastal zone. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - The tropical dry forest (TDF) is one the most threatened ecosystems in South America, existing on a landscape with different levels of ecological succession. Among satellites dedicated to Earth observation and monitoring ecosystem succession, CHRIS/PROBA is the only satellite that presents quasi-simultaneous multi-angular pointing and hyperspectral imaging. These two characteristics permit the study of structural and compositional differences of TDFs with different levels of succession. In this paper, we use 2008 and 2014 CHRIS/PROBA images from a TDF in Minas Gerais, Brazil to study ecosystem succession after abandonment. Using a -55° angle of observation; several classifiers including spectral angle mapper (SAM), support vector machine (SVM), and decision trees (DT) were used to test how well they discriminate between different successional stages. Our findings suggest that the SAM is the most appropriate method to classify TDFs as a function of succession (accuracies ~80 for % for late stage, ~85% for the intermediate stage, ~70% for early stage, and ~50% for other classes). Although CHRIS/PROBA cannot be used for large-scale/long-term monitoring of tropical forests because of its experimental nature; our results support the potential of using multi-angle hyperspectral data to characterize the structure and composition of TDFs in the near future. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - The expression of chemical compounds by individual plants of the same species in different locations may be affected by abiotic factors resulting in differences in the production of allelopathic compounds. The objective of this study was to compare the phytochemical profiles of plant species from two different forest formations in the state of Paraná, Brazil. The forest formations were Seasonal Semideciduous Forest (SSF) and Lowland Ombrophilous Dense Forest (LODF), and the five study species were Jacaranda micrantha, Cecropia pachystachya, Mimosa bimucronata, Schinus terebinthifolius and Cedrela fissilis. Secondary metabolites were extracted by exhaustive extraction with methanol, and the crude extract was fractionated using column chromatography. The fractions were used to calculate the retention factor of the main compounds using thin layer chromatography and phytochemical tests. The classes of compounds identified were practically the same among the analyzed species, however, at different levels of concentration. The type of tannins found in S. terebinthifolius differed between the two forest formations. © 2019 Associação Brasileira de Saúde Coletiv.

AB  - Natural regeneration is the main mechanism for restoring the structure of altered forests. Thus, the regeneration dynamics of Astronium graveolens, Astronium lecointei, Manilkara elata and Carapa guianensis were evaluated in 144 ha in the Tapajós National Forest to increase knowledge about the behavior of these species in the area. Data were obtained on five occasions over a 31-year period, in 240 plots of 5 m x 5 m, distributed randomly. The results showed that: Astronium spp needs silvicultural treatments to increase the population in natural regeneration in the area; Carapa guianensis can establish itself and develop naturally after logging in the area, without the need for silvicultural treatments; and Manilkara elata needs silvicultural monitoring to eliminate species that can compete with its development, either in large canopy openings or in shaded areas. © 2019 University of Sao Paolo.

AB  - Tree planting is the most widely used technique for tropical forest restoration because it accelerates the recovery of forest structure and ecosystem functioning. Despite the importance of tree size distribution to the ecological function and habitat quality of restored forests, it has received little attention. Here we ask if the structure of reference forests has been recovered by planting tree seedlings and discuss the implications of skewed tree-size distributions for sustainability of restored forests. We sampled 11 tropical forest sites that had undergone restoration for between 16 and 53 years after planting tree seedlings and nine reference ecosystems (old-growth, secondary and degraded forests) in Brazilian Atlantic forest, and compared them by the abundance of individuals in five diameter classes. Restored forests presented 83% greater abundance of large trees (>20 cm DBH), 41% lower abundance of saplings (1 ≤ DBH < 5 cm) and 43% lower abundance of small trees (5 ≤ DBH < 10 cm). The abundance of smaller individuals (DBH < 1 cm), however, did not differ between restored and reference forests, indicating successful colonization of the understorey. Low mortality in the large class (DBH ≥ 20 cm) results in excess of big trees, which constrains recruitment of small plants to the intermediate size classes, likely due to asymmetric competition for light. The excess of large trees demonstrates that gap dynamics can take longer to naturally re-establish in these even-aged forests, likely due to the high density of long-lived trees planted at the same time. Thinning may be a possible adaptive-management strategy to reduce the density of big trees and stimulate recruitment of intermediate size classes. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Tropical biodiversity benefits humanity. However, the costs of conserving topical biodiversity are largely borne by local communities. The damage caused by wild animals to human-cultivated plants (crop-raiding) in tropical ecosystems directly affects the livelihoods of local agriculturalists, which erodes their support for conserving biodiversity. We used data collected between 2013 and 2015 from 132 camera-trap stations and responses from 157 interviewees representing 47 semi-subsistence communities to quantify and contextualize terrestrial vertebrate crop-raiding damage to manioc (Manihot esculenta) agricultural fields (i.e., roçados) in the Médio-Juruá region of western Brazilian Amazonia. The 5 vertebrate species identified by respondents as the most damaging crop raiders were agoutis (Dasyprocta fuliginosa), collared peccaries (Pecari tajacu), pacas (Cuniculus paca), red brocket deer (Mazama americana), and spiny rats (family Echimyidae). These species were frequently detected by camera traps in early-successional forests. Respondents reported mean manioc stem losses to crop raiders of 7.3%/roçado. Proportional losses of more palatable manioc varieties were approximately 3 times higher than more phytochemically defended varieties, further constraining crop choice. Respondents estimated that in the absence of active crop-raider suppression, overall losses would have been 73.9%/respondent/annum, and therefore invested substantial effort in crop protection. Small communities, already economically disadvantaged by isolation from the material, service, and information monopoly of urban centers, were most affected by crop raiding. Although, the most damaging crop raiders are ideal candidates for sustainable subsistence hunting, we found only weak evidence of positive opportunities for agriculturalists to hunt crop raiders to compensate for crop losses. Our study indicated that crop raiding may continue to exacerbate the challenges inherent in tropical agriculture and represents a significant forest ecosystem disservice. © 2018 The Wildlife Society. © The Wildlife Society, 2018

AB  - To decipher the long-term influences of pre-Columbian land occupations on contemporary forest structure, diversity, and functioning in Amazonia, most of the previous research focused on the alluvial plains of the major rivers of the Amazon basin. Terra firme, that is, nonflooded forests, particularly from the Guiana Shield, are yet to be explored. In this study, we aim to give new insights into the subtle traces of pre-Columbian influences on present-day forests given the archaeological context of terra firme forests of the Guiana Shield. Following archaeological prospects on 13 sites in French Guiana, we carried out forest inventories inside and outside archaeological sites and assessed the potential pre-Columbian use of the sampled tree species using an original ethnobotanical database of the Guiana Shield region. Aboveground biomass (320 and 380 T/ha, respectively), basal area (25–30 and 30–35 m2/ha, respectively), and tree density (550 and 700 stem/ha, respectively) were all significantly lower on anthropized plots (As) than on nonanthropized plots (NAs). Ancient human presence shaped the species composition of the sampled forests with Arecaceae, Burseraceae, and Lauraceae significantly more frequent in As and Annonaceae and Lecythidaceae more frequent in NAs. Although alpha diversity was not different between As and NAs, the presence of pre-Columbian sites enhances significantly the forest beta diversity at the landscape level. Finally, trees with edible fruits are positively associated with pre-Columbian sites, whereas trees used for construction or for their bark are negatively associated with pre-Columbian sites. Half a millennium after their abandonment, former occupied places from the inner Guiana Shield still bear noticeable differences with nonanthropized places. Considering the lack of data concerning archaeology of terra firme Amazonian forests, our results suggest that pre-Columbian influences on the structure (lower current biomass), diversity (higher beta diversity), and composition (linked to the past human tree uses) of current Amazonian forests might be more important than previously thought. © 2019 by the Ecological Society of America

AB  - How does species choice influence ecological restoration outcomes? In order to answer this question, the goal of this study was to assess the community structure and species richness of natural regeneration beneath the canopy of four native species from the Atlantic Forest (Guarea guidonia (L.) Sleumer; Inga edulis Mart; Nectandra memhranacea (SW) Griseb; and, Piptadenia gonoacantha (Mart.) J.F. Macbr). The research was carried out in plantations of native tree species at the Guapiau Ecological Reserve, in Rio de Janeiro State, Brazil. Our results pointed that abundance, basal area and species richness were significantly higher beneath Inga compared to Nectandra and Guarea. Whereas the lowest values observed in Guarea may suggest its negative effects under natural regeneration. Therefore, we highlighted that the positive or negative biological effects of tree species, instead of their simple response (mortality and initial growth), must be considered in ecological restoration projects. © 2019 Universidade Federal Rural do Rio de Janeiro (UFRRJ).

AB  - The forests of southeastern Amazonia are highly threatened by disturbances such as fragmentation, understory fires, and extreme climatic events. Large-bodied frugivores such as the lowland tapir (Tapirus terrestris) have the potential to offset this process, supporting natural forest regeneration by dispersing a variety of seeds over long distances to disturbed forests. However, we know little about their effectiveness as seed dispersers in degraded forest landscapes. Here, we investigate the seed dispersal function of lowland tapirs in Amazonian forests subject to a range of human (fire and fragmentation) and natural (extreme droughts and windstorms) disturbances, using a combination of field observations, camera traps, and light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data. Tapirs travel and defecate more often in degraded forests, dispersing much more seeds in these areas [9,822 seeds per ha/year (CI95% = 9,106; 11,838)] than in undisturbed forests [2,950 seeds per ha/year (CI95% = 2,961; 3,771)]. By effectively dispersing seeds across disturbed forests, tapirs may contribute to natural forest regeneration—the cheapest and usually the most feasible way to achieve large-scale restoration of tropical forests. Through the dispersal of large-seeded species that eventually become large trees, such frugivores also contribute indirectly to maintaining forest carbon stocks. These functions may be critical in helping tropical countries to achieve their goals to maintain and restore biodiversity and its ecosystem services. Ultimately, preserving these animals along with their habitats may help in the process of natural recovery of degraded forests throughout the tropics.

AB  - Tropical Dry Forests (TDFs) have been broadly converted into pastures and crops, with direct consequences to biodiversity, ecosystem services, and social welfare. Such land use and cover changes (LUCC) usually are strongly influenced by government environmental and development policies. The present study aimed at analyzing LUCC in Brazilian TDFs between 2000 and 2015, using the north of Minas Gerais state (128 000 km2) as a case study. We evaluated the potential biophysical and social-economic drivers of TDF loss, natural regeneration and net area change at the county level. Further, we determined the effects of these LUCC variables on socioeconomic indicators. We identified a considerable change in TDF cover, expressed as 9825 km2 of deforestation and 6523 km2 of regeneration, which resulted in a net loss of 3302 km2. The annual rate of TDF cover change was -1.2%, which is extremely high for a vegetation type that is protected as part of the Atlantic Rain Forest biome since 1993. TDF deforestation was directly affected by county area and by the increase in cattle density, and inversely affected by terrain declivity, indicating that land conversion is mostly driven by cattle ranching in flat regions. TDF regeneration was directly affected by county area and inversely affected by the increase in population density and terrain declivity. LUCC variables did not affect welfare indicators, undermining claims from rural sectors that TDF protection would cause a socioeconomic burden for northern Minas Gerais. Our results highlight the importance of naturally regenerating secondary forests to the maintenance of ecosystem integrity and its services, which are frequently neglected in conservation strategies. Hegemonic macroeconomic policies affecting TDFs have been deeply rooted in deforestation for commodities production, and need urgent review because they cause long-term environmental impacts without evidence of welfare gains. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - Manipulation experiments can contribute to understand the ecological role of litter in forest ecosystems. However, there are few studies of this nature. We evaluated the effects of the litter layer removal (RS) on the soil arthropod community in two abandoned plantations of Corymbia citriodora at different stages of the Atlantic Rainforest natural regeneration. Pitfall traps were randomly installed in plots (5 x 20 m) of RS and control (CT) in a 19-year old plantation (P19: less advanced stage of natural regeneration of Atlantic Rainforest species; higher contribution of eucalypt in litterfall) and a 42-year old plantation (P42: more advanced stage of regeneration; higher contribution of native species in litterfall), in rainy season and dry season at ‘União Biological Reserve’, RJ state, Brazil. RS inhibited the abundance of the most taxonomic groups, both in P19 and P42. In general, Diptera, Poduromorpha, Pseudoscorpionida, Symphypleona, and larvae of Coleoptera were the most negatively impacted groups by RS. In contrast, RS favored some other groups, principally Entomobryomorpha and Formicidae. Total richness, evenness and diversity were lower in RS in both plantations. However, this negative effect was stronger in the P19, where RS also decreased total abundance and average richness. The higher canopy closure probable minimized the negative impact of RS on the soil arthropods in P42. © 2019, Universidade Federal de Santa Maria. All rights reserved.

AB  - Mixed tree plantings and natural regeneration are the main restoration approaches for recovering tropical forests worldwide. Despite substantial differences in implementation costs between these methods, little is known regarding how they differ in terms of ecological outcomes, which is key information for guiding decision making and cost-effective restoration planning. Here, we compared the early ecological outcomes of natural regeneration and tree plantations for restoring the Brazilian Atlantic Forest in agricultural landscapes. We assessed and compared vegetation structure and composition in young (7-20 yr old) mixed tree plantings (PL), second-growth tropical forests established on former pastures (SGp), on former Eucalyptus spp. plantations (SGe), and in old-growth reference forests (Ref). We sampled trees with diameter at breast height (DBH) 1-5 cm (saplings) and trees at DBH > 5 cm (trees) in a total of 32 20 × 45 m plots established in these landscapes. Overall, the ecological outcomes of natural regeneration and restoration plantations were markedly different. SGe forests showed higher abundance of large (DBH > 20 cm) nonnative species, of which 98% were resprouting Eucalyptus trees, than SGp and PL, and higher total aboveground biomass; however, aboveground biomass of native species was higher in PL than in SGe. PL forests had lower abundance of native saplings and lianas than both naturally established second-growth forests, and lower proportion of animal dispersed saplings than SGe, probably due to higher isolation from native forest remnants. Rarefied species richness of trees was lower in SGp, intermediate in SGe and Ref and higher in PL, whereas rarefied species richness of saplings was higher in SG than in Ref. Species composition differed considerably among regeneration types. Although these forests are inevitably bound to specific landscape contexts and may present varying outcomes as they develop through longer time frames, the ecological particularities of forests established through different restoration approaches indicate that naturally established forests may not show similar outcomes to mixed tree plantings. The results of this study underscore the importance that restoration decisions need to be based on more robust expectations of outcomes that allow for a better analysis of the cost-effectiveness of different restoration approaches before scaling-up forest restoration in the tropics. © 2017 by the Ecological Society of America.

AB  - The liberation of trees of interest by cutting competing trees, woody vines and other lianas is a very important silvicultural practice in the management of forest species of interest present in secondary forests. Thus, we aimed to know the influence of the liberation on the mechanical stability and what dimensional height limit of C. canjerana (Vell.) Mart. saplings must have so that there is no problem of buckling of the stem after the liberation. To this end, the liberation of 105 plants of the species was carried out and the diameter and height were measured before and annually for three years after the application of the treatment. Based on the Mechanical Design Theory, a regression model was generated to know to allocation mode of the diameter and height in the analized plants. The minimum diameter for buckling and the safety factor for all trees were calculated. The liberation resulted in the buckling of the stem of five trees, all below the safety limit, that is, with a real diameter smaller than the minimum diameter to support the weight of its height. According to the regression model generated the species grows proportionally in diameter and height. However, the liberation influenced the mechanical stability of the plants liberated, making a greater increment in diameter necessary so that the trees remained standing. The results demonstrate that the dimensions of the trees to be liberated should be considered in order to avoid problems of buckling of the stem after the treatment. © 2019, Sociedade de Investigacoes Florestais.

AB  - Forest age has been reported to be a determining factor affecting species richness and composition or population abundance in forests and soil seed banks in fragmented landscapes. In this study, we characterized species richness, density, and floristic composition of the above-ground vegetation and the seed bank in young and mature forest fragments in a semi-arid region of north-eastern Brazil. Forty plots were set up in the mature forest and 40 in the young forest. Herbaceous species and seedlings and juveniles of woody species up to 1 m in height were included in the sampling of above-ground vegetation. Seed bank samples including leaf litter were collected and maintained in a greenhouse for 6 months. Our findings indicated a similarity in species richness between seed bank and above-ground vegetation. The floristic composition of the seed bank was similar from that of the above-ground vegetation throughout succession. The mean density of the seed bank was higher than that of the above-ground vegetation in both forests. Therefore, only a subset of the seeds stored in the soil seemed to consistently contribute to the natural regeneration of forests. © 2019, Botanical Society of Sao Paulo.

AB  - Vegetation indices are useful tools to remotely estimate several important parameters related to ecosystem functioning. However, improving and validating estimations for a wide range of vegetation types are necessary. In this study, we provide a methodology for the estimation of the leaf area index (LAI) in a tropical dry forest (TDF) using the light diffusion through the canopy as a function of the successional stage. For this purpose, we estimated the K coefficient, a parameter that relates the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) to LAI, based on photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and solar radiation. The study was conducted in the Mata Seca State Park, in southeastern Brazil, from 2012 to 2013. We defined four successional stages (very early, early, intermediate, and late) and established one optical phenology tower at one plot of 20 × 20 m per stage. Towers measured the incoming and reflected solar radiation and PAR for NDVI calculation. For each plot, we established 24 points for LAI sampling through hemispherical photographs. Because leaf cover is highly seasonal in TDFs, we determined ΔK (leaf growth phase) and Kmax (leaf maturity phase). We detected a strong correlation between NDVI and LAI, which is necessary for a reliable determination of the K coefficient. Both NDVI and LAI varied significantly between successional stages, indicating sensitivity to structural changes in forest regeneration. Furthermore, the K values differed between successional stages and correlated significantly with other environmental variables such as air temperature and humidity, fraction of absorbed PAR, and soil moisture. Thus, we established a model based on spectral properties of the vegetation coupled with biophysical characteristics in a TDF that makes possible to estimate LAI from NDVI values. The application of the K coefficient can improve remote estimations of forest primary productivity and gases and energy exchanges between vegetation and atmosphere. This model can be applied to distinguish different successional stages of TDFs, supporting environmental monitoring and conservation policies towards this biome. © 2018, ISB.

AB  - Carbon accumulation in tropical secondary forests may be limited in part by nitrogen (N) availability, but changes in N during tropical forest succession have rarely been quantified. We explored N cycle dynamics across a chronosequence of secondary tropical forests in the Mata Atlântica of Bahia, Brazil in order to understand how quickly the N cycle recuperates. We hypothesized that N fixation would decline over the course of succession as N availability and N gaseous losses increased. We measured N fixation, KCl-extractable N, net mineralization and nitrification, resin-strip sorbed N, gaseous N emissions and the soil δ15N in stands that were 20, 35, 50, and > 50 years old. Contrary to our initial hypothesis, we found no significant differences between stand ages in any measured variable. Our findings suggest that secondary forests in this region of the Atlantic forest reached pre-disturbance N cycling dynamics after just 20 years of succession. This result contrasts with previous study in the Amazon, where the N cycle recovered slowly after abandonment from pasture reaching pre-disturbance N cycling levels after ~50 years of succession. Our results suggest the pace of the N cycle, and perhaps tropical secondary forest, recovery, may vary regionally. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - In the Rio Grande do Sul State, in southern Brazil, there are hundreds of Eucalyptus forest farms for pulp production, distributed in several municipalities. In these pulpwood production farms, a major forestry restoration project is underway for Permanent Preservation Areas (PPAs), which have peculiarities that may favor or hinder restoration. A positive factor for the restoration is the proximity of forest remnants in certain PPAs, which favors the tree species' natural regeneration. On the other hand, in many other PPAs, the introduction of cattle and horses represents an impact factor as these animals generate damage and a high mortality of planted and regenerated seedlings. In order to search for alternatives for the restoration of these PPAs, the planting of seedlings of native species in nuclei was implemented and evaluated, an alternative technique to traditional reforestation with total area plantation. Native tree species with the potential to resist physical damage and herbivory by cattle and horses were identified, which were planted in seedling nuclei. Seedling nuclei fenced as an alternative, to avoid damages by cattle and horses was also adopted. The two techniques - using seedling nuclei of resistant species and fenced nuclei - were evaluated in field experiments. The fenced seedling nuclei reduced drastically the mortality or damages in the plants caused by trampling, breaking or herbivory. The use of resistant tree species and fenced seedling nuclei are effective nucleation techniques in areas where cattle and horses are introduced, are both very promising techniques to be adopted on a large-scale in the restoration of PPAs in Rio Grande do Sul, Southern Brazil. © 2020 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

AB  - Maximizing initial aboveground woody biomass (AGB) accumulation in order to obtain early payments for carbon stocking is essential for the financial viability of reforestation programs fostered by climate mitigation efforts. Intensive silviculture, i.e., silviculture traditionally used in commercial forestry to maximize productivity and gains, has recently been advocated as a promising approach to enhance AGB accumulation in restoration plantations. However, this approach may hamper natural forest regeneration and ecological succession due to high competition between colonizing plants and planted trees. We investigated the impacts of different silvicultural treatments applied to restoration plantations with 20 native tree species on AGB accumulation and spontaneous regeneration of native woody species in an experiment set up in the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. Intensive silviculture demonstrated a remarkable potential to enhance AGB accumulation in restoration plantations by increasing up to three times the AGB of tree stands (from ~25 to 75 Mg/ha in the 12th year). Intensive fertilization/weed control enhanced AGB accumulation, while higher tree density and the proportion of pioneers did not have a significant effect on AGB over the time. In spite of higher costs (cost increase of 13–19%), the cost-effectiveness for AGB accumulation of intensive silviculture was comparable to that of traditional silviculture applied to restoration (US$50–100/Mg AGB for 3 × 2 m spacing). Contrary to our expectations, we did not find a trade-off between AGB accumulation by planted trees and the spontaneous regeneration of tree species, since intensive silviculture enhanced the regeneration of both planted (total of 12 species) and colonizing woody species (total of 30 species) in the plantation understory. Specifically, a strong association was found between AGB stocks and the abundance and richness of colonizing species, a vast majority of which (90% of species and 95% of individuals) were dispersed by animals. We report a case of positive correlation between AGB stocking and woody species regeneration in the restoration of the Atlantic Forest. Fostering the establishment and maintenance of restoration tree plantations can, in some cases, be a win-win strategy for climate mitigation and biodiversity conservation in human-modified tropical landscapes. © 2019 by the Ecological Society of America

AB  - In the last three decades, Brazil nut (Bertholletia excelsa) has emerged as a cornerstone species for Amazonia. This has gone hand-in-hand with the creation of extractive reserves, an alternative land use model to balance biodiversity conservation with rural development, whereby traditional forest residents are assigned legal responsibility for co-management of these reserves and their resources, including Brazil nut. The essential role of this species in conservation and local livelihoods has precipitated a shift from general exploitation to more conscious, intensive management. Drawing heavily on our more than 25 years of research in the Brazilian state of Acre and the larger body of B. excelsa research across the Amazon basin, we ask: (1) Are Brazil nut harvests sustainable in terms of fruit production patterns and resilience to nut (seed) collection? (2) In what ways might production be augmented and nut quality enhanced? We highlight that scientific evidence and local knowledge indicate that current levels of nut harvests are compatible with sustaining populations of B. excelsa and its key seed disperser, Dasyprocta spp. Rather than concentrating on the fate of most seeds produced, the more pressing risk to B. excelsa populations is survival of existing large trees. Moreover, ample knowledge indicates possible futures to increase productivity by protecting and improving conditions of these large trees. Cutting lianas from host tree crowns dramatically improves productivity over time. Additional promising ways to grow Brazil nut-rich forests include: (1) Search and map previously unharvested productive trees located beyond traditional collection trails, (2) Tend new recruits, particularly in abandoned swidden fallows, and (3) Conduct enrichment plantings to establish small-scale intensive groves. Upgraded drying, storage and processing have led to dramatic improvements in nut quality and market access over the last 30 years. The growing knowledge base and diverse management interventions examined help promote Brazil nut sustainability and maintain its critical role in conserving Amazonian forests. © 2018 Universidade Federal do Parana.

AB  - Most of the northeastern territory of Brazil is occupied by scrub, which is characterized by xerophytic vegetation, different vegetation types and a biome considered more sensitive to human interference and climate. This study aimed to characterize the floristic composition and structure of a fragment savanna located in Chapada Moura region, at Farm Elmo Moreno Iguatu, Ceará state. Forty-five (45) plots of 10x20 m were established and all individuals with diameter ≥ 3 cm and height ≥ 1 m were measured. Two thousand and two hundred fifty-six (2256) individuals ha-1, representing 36 species, 29 genera and 13 families were observed. Species diversity was low compared to other vegetation types with Shannon Index of 1.59. Croton sonderianus and Combretum leprosum were the species with the highest DoR, DR, F, IVC and IVI followed Pityrocarpa moniliformis. The presence of a large number of unique and rare woody species shows that the work done so far has not yet sampled the diversity of species present in the different regions of the Biome. This 70-year preserved area is still in early stages of ecological succession evidenced by low species richness and greater occurrence of species of the genus Croton. © 2018, Universidade Federal de Santa Maria.

AB  - Studies on floristic composition should be considered extremely relevant since they provide essential information for the understanding of vegetation structure and dynamics and are therefore considered essential for the knowledge of natural regeneration and management forms. Especially when they are carried out in a riparian environment since they shelter high natural wealth, which in itself would justify studies for the conservation and management of its biodiversity, thus, these stand out for their high species richness, diversity genetics and protection of water resources, soils, wild and aquatic fauna. This study aimed to carry out a bibliographic survey of the studies carried out in riparian environments in the Southeast and Center-West regions of Brazil and to describe the main inquiries of these studies. In this work it was possible to verify that the knowledge about these forests evolved from simple floristic works to very elaborate studies where the role of environmental variables in the dynamics of the floristic and structural composition of these environments is evaluated, which demonstrates the growing interest on the part of the researchers in more elaborate studies for floristic and structural analyzes on a spatial and temporal scale. © 2019 Nativa, Sinop.

AB  - The nuclei of vegetation are structures spontaneously formed by small clusters of individual shrubs and trees that, upon evolving in disturbed pastures can contribute to the ecological succession. In order to understand the evolution of passive restoration processes in tropical ecosystems, after extensive cattle ranching was stopped, environments with low environmental attributes were studied, located in the northern slope of the isolated mounds between floodplain. After 40 years of abandonment, the nuclei of vegetation colonized 20% of the graminoid ecosystems sampled, presenting at a moderate stage of disturbance. The floristic composition of the upper strata and regenerating showed that nuclei with two or more pioneer forest species and anemocoric dispersion syndrome, such as Moquiniastrum polymorphum, present a high probability of having their restoration processes catalyzed in time. Developed nuclei present higher richness and abundance in their regenerating stratum, besides zoological and non-pioneering species, suggesting positive interactions between the ecological processes, a condition that gives sustainability to the advances of the passive forest restoration. The improvement of this information can contribute to the development of models of induced restoration based on the effects of nucleation. © 2019, Universidade Federal de Santa Maria.

AB  -                              Restoration projects may have broad and complex ecological goals that require distinct and integrative measures for evaluating restoration development and success. However, most studies usually evaluate structural and species composition parameters, with less emphasis on ecological processes and functioning. The main objective of this study is to use an integrated approach that considers structural and floristic parameters as well as ecological processes and functional traits to evaluate and identify the parameters that most differentiate forests undergoing restoration and their reference sites. Additionally, we tested if the recovery of ecosystem functionality happens at the same rate as the recovery of vegetation structure. We performed the study in three 10-year-old restoration and three adjacent reference areas located in the south of Brazil (subtropical forest). We sampled a total of 15 plots (100 m                             2                              in size) per treatment, per site and collected data of trees, natural regeneration, litter stock, decomposition, detritivory, and litter and soil C:N ratio. We also used a multifunctionality index to account for the broad functionality of the ecosystem. Results showed that forests undergoing restoration had lower values of vegetation structure and multifunctionality, indicating that restoration sites have not yet achieved values similar to the reference ecosystem. Values for species richness and functional diversity, however, were higher in restoration sites. Moreover, even though values were lower for multifunctionality, differences toward reference sites were less pronounced than we expected when compared to values of vegetation structure, showing that ecological processes may recover even before the full recovery of aboveground vegetation.                          © 2018 Society for Ecological Restoration

AB  - Background: Brazil has considerably reduced the number of cases of malaria in recent years and aims to eradicate the disease completely, however, vivax malaria continues to be a major challenge for the health system. In this context, the key to building a successful elimination programme may lie in the knowledge and the perceptions of the health agents, the patients affected by the disease and the personnel responsible for malaria diagnosis, treatment and control at the local level. Methods: A qualitative study was undertaken in Manaus, capital of the state of Amazonas, Western Brazilian Amazon, using a sample of 33 patients who were being treated for malaria and 22 health agents who were working in malaria diagnosis, treatment and control at the local level. A semi-structured interview with a further thematic analysis was performed. Results: There are still many myths regarding malaria transmission and treatment that may hinder the sensitization of the population of this region in relation to the use of current control tools and elimination strategies, such as mass drug administration (MDA). Most health professionals reported that the abandonment of treatment for malaria by the patient is related to poor social conditions, the high incidence of alcoholism and the low level of schooling of the affected population. One negative perception, observed in both groups with regard to the use of insecticide-treated nets, is that they may cause skin irritations and allergies. Most patients and health professionals have described malaria as an impossible disease to eliminate because it is intrinsically associated with forest landscapes, and according to them, elimination would only be possible if there were a vaccine against malaria. Conclusion: In the Amazon, cultural perceptions about the etiology of this disease can influence the behaviour and practices that social groups adopt in relation to the different forms of living in a malaria-endemic context. Negative perceptions about malaria elimination can act as a barrier when trying to reach proper coverage for control strategies such as mosquito nets and MDA. © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - Information on the diameter at the breast height (DBH) growth of trees can be useful to understand their productivity and temporal dynamics in natural forests. This study presents the first results of increments in DBH of Araucaria angustifolia trees since their logging prohibition in southern Brazil, in late 1970s. We used dendrochronology techniques in 210 individuals in three different sites, which allowed a retrospective analysis of the DBH increment from 60 to 150 years. We adjusted temporal dimensional models whose results may help to support a sustainable forest management of A. angustifolia in southern Brazil. The results showed that the width of annual growth rings varied from 0.04 to 4.8 cm year-1 along the last 60 to 150 years, and the mean annual increment ranged from 0.3 to 0.9 cm year-1. The DBH increment accumulated in the last ten years showed a decreasing pattern, indicating that most of the sampled trees had already reached maturity. This result denotes a proportional loss in DBH increment with increasing DBH and age. Decreasing DBH growth rates became even more evident in the last ten years (i.e. ~0.15 cm year-1), indicating a need of silvicultural intervention in some sites to reduce competition among trees for soil nutrients and light. Regarding the average DBH increment growth, the time the trees need to reach the optimal DBH harvesting diameter of 40 cm ranged from 25 to 112 years, according to the local site index characteristics. The curve inflection point that represents the DBH increment occurred between 35 and 45 years for this specific DBH. These results confirm the viability and need of forest management practices of A. angustifolia trees due to the saturation of the trees DBH growth and increment capacity that reached its inflection. Therefore, since their logging prohibition, most A. angustifolia trees reached their optimal DBH harvesting size. Forest management is necessary for conservation of the forest structure. It would favor the growth of young A. angustifolia, seedling productions, the natural regeneration of this species and genetic diversity; and stimulate the increase of timber production. © 2007-2018 Southern Cross Publishing-Australia.

AB  - The Pale-bellied Tyrant-manakin (Neopelma pallescens) inhabits semi-deciduous and riparian forests in central-north South America. Contrary to most manakins, there is no evident sexual dichromatism in the species and little is known about its breeding biology. We studied the breeding biology of a colour-banded population of the species from August to December 2016 and from August to October 2017 in the Campus Florestal of the Universidade Federal de Viçosa, south-eastern Brazil. The breeding season extended from early September to late November. The species is promiscuous, with males exhibiting simple courtship displays (exploded leks) in individual arenas. The nest (n = 13) is a cup attached by its top lip between forked branches and is very simple, with a structural layer made with dry grass stems and heads, attached to the branch with spider silk. The outer and lining layers are absent. The mean clutch size was 1.8 eggs (n = 11), which are oval and pale coloured, covered with spots of different shades of brown, often concentrated in the larger pole. Mean egg length and width (± SD) were 21.0 ± 0.9 × 15.8 ± 0.7 mm (n = 14) and the mean weight was 2.8 ± 0.4 g (n = 10). The incubation period could not be estimated, but the nestling period was 15 days (n = 2). The simple percentage of successful nests was 15.4%, with 76.9% of the nests depredated and 7.7% abandoned. This is the first detailed study about the breeding biology of any Neopelma species, providing relevant data for the study of the evolution of life history strategies not only for the genus, but for the whole family Pipridae. © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

Data were collected from 54 hectares in Caracaraí (Roraima state) and Itaúba (Mato Grosso state). Frequency distributions were compared by measures of central tendency, variability, form and adherence by Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test. Natural regeneration was correlated with environmental variables, seed collection intensity and fauna activity by Spearman correlation coefficient and Kruskal-Wallis. The Brazil nut groves presented different diametric structures, which can be attributed to differences in young individuals in the smaller diametric classes. The higher density of juveniles in canopy gaps and the lack of a significant correlation between seed collection intensity and natural regeneration indicate that canopy openings from logging could have been the major impact factor in the natural regeneration establishment and in Brazil nut grove rejuvenation. © 2019, Universidade Federal de Santa Maria.

AB  - Past human modification of forests has been documented in central, southwestern, and eastern Amazonia, especially near large rivers. Northwestern Amazonia, and interfluvial forests there in particular, are assumed to exhibit little past human impact. We analyzed soils and floristic structure and composition of interfluvial forests located in the Içana River basin, northwestern Amazonia, to assess their degree of past human modification. Ancient Baniwa village sites, abandoned centuries ago, have given rise to “ancestral forests” with as much as 57% of all trees/palms belonging to a group of species managed currently by the Baniwa, compared to only 10% of such species in old-growth forests that are not remembered as having been inhabited or managed in Baniwa oral tradition. Participatory mapping and direct observations revealed ancestral forests to be widely distributed throughout the region, whereas old-growth forests are rare. Managed species in ancestral forests contributed 5-fold more to total tree/palm biomass than in old-growth forests. Human management has produced lasting changes in floristic composition, maintained total tree/palm biomass, and improved soil quality. This is the first study to demonstrate past human modification in Amazonian interfluvial forests, while explicitly isolating historical human management from edaphic effects on floristic structure and composition. Despite environmental limitations on human population size, posed by nutrient-poor black water rivers and acidic, sandy soils, indigenous peoples of northwestern Amazonia left a clear, lasting cultural legacy in ancestral forests. Given legal changes that threaten indigenous peoples' land rights currently under debate in Brazil, we call for a reconsideration of biodiversity conservation policies and indigenous rights in areas that show enduring legacies of management by indigenous populations. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Human-induced wildfires are one of the greatest threats to tropical forest and are predicted to increase in importance due to altered regimes associated with climate change. Wildfires promote high tree mortality, thus modifying forest structure and composition, and lead to habitat loss and fragmentation. Wildfires may also have effects on the adjacent unburnt areas due to edge influence; conversely, proximity to unburnt forest stands may favor regeneration in the burnt areas. We evaluated wildfire effects on the forest structure of Brazilian Atlantic forest remnants. We established 244 plots along eight 360 m-long transects distributed among three burnt patches, where we measured structural attributes of overstory, understory, and deadwood. The wildfire promoted very high mortality of trees, saplings, and lianas, changing substantially the forest structure. Our analyses showed clear differences between the burnt and unburnt areas but no clear gradients, highlighting the incipient stage of edge influence-related processes. The Neotropical bracken fern Pteridium arachnoideum was dominant in the burnt areas, which can possibly arrest secondary succession. Our results highlight the importance of wildfires as a menace to Brazilian Atlantic Forests remnants, as well as to tropical rainforests elsewhere - an ever-rising concern in a future of increased fire frequency. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - During forest succession, changes in tree species composition and individual turnover may be affected by deterministic and stochastic processes. In this study, we used both population and community approaches to assess the relative effects of deterministic and stochastic processes along the secondary succession of a tropical forest. We aimed to identify the mechanisms of community assemblage based on an analysis of abiotic and biotic drivers of demography. We assessed the demography (recruitment and survival rates) of trees occurring in an edaphic-successional gradient (forests aged 7–17, 20–30, 30–55, and >80 years; two soil types) of a regenerating forest in Southern Brazil. We first tested for stochasticity by building null models (randomized species composition and abundance) for each forest age interval. The composition and abundance of plants in all communities were different from those expected by the null models, which indicated determinism at the studied scale. We then used the structural equation models to assess the importance of environmental drivers (such as soil type and forest age) and species interactions (such as basal area, individual density and function, and phylogenetic diversity) to predict recruitment and survival. We found that both abiotic and biotic drivers affected the community assembly in successional gradients. Environmental drivers (soil stress and limitations related to forest structural complexity) indirectly affected recruitment and survival via biotic drivers (competitive ability, facilitation and niche complementarity). Therefore, the community assembly during succession is the result of a multi-factor process acting on recruitment and survival rates, which ultimately affect individual and species turnover. © 2018 Elsevier GmbH

AB  - Despite the considerable loss of natural area in the Pampa biome, the number of scientific studies carried out here is low; it is lower in terms of natural regeneration. Therefore, the present study analyzed arboreal shrub and natural regeneration as well as the influence of environmental variables on the distribution of a riverine forest of the Espinilho stream in the Pampa biome, Rio Grande do Sul. A hundred plots were systematically set for arboreal shrub sampling. To evaluate the regenerating component, two classes were established: Class I and Class II. The main species in the arboreal shrub were Ocotea acutifolia (Nees) Mez and Pouteria salicifolia (Spreng.) Radlk., while those in natural regeneration were Eugenia uniflora L. and Blepharocalyx salicifolius (Kunth) O.Berg. The characteristics of the relief, soil, and canopy conditioned the species of the arboreal shrub and regenerating strata. © 2019 Fundacao de Pesquisas Florestais do Parana.

AB  - Habitat destruction and fragmentation alter the quality of habitats and put populations under the risk of extinction. Changes in population parameters can provide early warning signs of negative impacts. In tropical forests, where habitat loss and fragmentation are vast, such indicators are of high relevance for directing conservation efforts before effects are irreversible. Most of our knowledge from tropical ecosystems originates from community level surveys, whereas our understanding of the influence of habitat conversion on vital rates of species is limited. This study focused on the influence of anthropogenic habitat fragmentation on the survival probability and abundance of three leaf-litter frog species (Rhinella ornata, Ischnocnema guentheri and I. parva) in forest patches of the Atlantic rainforest of South-east Brazil compared to a continuous forest. The species differ in their matrix tolerance: high for R. ornata and low for I. guentheri and I. parva and, thus, we examined whether their survival and abundance correspond to this classification. Ischnocnema guentheri showed highest abundances in all study sites and low mortality in the forest patches compared to the continuous forest; I. parva was encountered only in isolated fragments, with very low mortality in one isolated fragment; and the matrix tolerant species had generally low abundance and showed no clear pattern in terms of mortality in the different sites. Our counter-intuitive results show that even matrix sensitive amphibian species may show high abundance and low mortality in small forest patches. Therefore, these patches can be of high value for amphibian conservation regardless of their degree of matrix aversion. Landscape level conservation planning should not abandon small habitat patches, especially in highly fragmented tropical environments. Copyright Henning Steinicke et al.

AB  - Premise of research. Plant functional groups of different stages of tropical succession are adapted to distinct environments with different availabilities of such resources as light, water, and nutrients. The sites at early-successional stages commonly have low-fertility degraded soils and are colonized by fast-growing shade-intolerant plant species, while the sites at late-successional stages usually have soils with high contents of organic matter and nutrients and are colonized by slow-growing shade-tolerant plant species. In this study, we aimed to assess the strategies adopted by plants for nutrient acquisition over tropical succession. Methodology. Grassland, shrub vegetation, and secondary and mature forests of an Atlantic rain forest ecosystem in southern Brazil were studied. Fine roots were sampled to assess length density, specific root length (SRL), diameter, tissue density, root-hair length and incidence, and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) colonization. Rhizospheric and bulk soils were sampled to assess microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and microbial biomass nitrogen (MBN); basal respiration; total and labile C; and concentrations of N, P, K, Ca, and Mg. Pivotal results. Fine roots with longer SRL, greater incidence of root hairs, longer root hairs, and greater AMF colonization were exhibited by plants in early-successional stages in contrast with plants in late-successional ones. Nutrient depletion zones were detected in the rhizospheres of plants in early-successional stages. Fine roots from the late-successional sites exhibited greater diameter and tissue density. High values for labile C, MBC, MBN, basal respiration, and the nutrient accumulation zone occurred in the rhizospheres of plants in late-successional stages in contrast with the rhizospheres of plants in early-successional ones. Conclusions. Our results suggest that early-successional plant species invest in fine roots with morphological features for a highly efficient nutrient uptake and in AMF (scavenging strategy), whereas late-successional plant species invest in other chemoheterotrophic microorganisms in the rhizosphere (mining strategy) for nutrient acquisition. © 2019 by The University of Chicago.

AB  - Seed arrival is a limiting factor for the regeneration of diverse tropical forests and may be an important mechanism that drives patterns of tree species’ distribution. Here we quantify spatial and seasonal variation in seed rain of secondary forests in southern Bahia, Brazil. We also examine whether secondary forest age enhances seed dispersal and whether seed rain density and diversity in secondary forests decay with distance from mature forest. Across a chronosequence of 15 pairs of mature and secondary forests, 105 seed traps were installed and monitored for one year. We tested the effects of secondary forest age, distance from mature forest, and seasonality on monthly seed rain density, diversity, seed dispersal mode, and diaspore size. We found that secondary forest age had strong, positive effects on the diversity of seed rain, which was generally higher during the wet season. Moreover, contrasting patterns among diversity indices revealed that seeds of rare species occurred more often in 40 yr old secondary forests and mature forests. While the proportion of biotically and abiotically dispersed seeds did not change significantly with distance from mature forest across all forest age classes, we found that biotically dispersed seeds contributed disproportionately more to seed rain diversity. Our results emphasize the importance of biotic dispersal to enhance diversity during secondary succession and suggest that changes in secondary forest structure have the potential to enhance the diversity of tropical secondary forests, principally by increasing dispersal of rare species. © 2019 Piotto et al.

AB  - Environmental factors, especially light, temperature, and edaphic conditions are of great importance for the establishment of plant communities. In areas degraded by deforestation, these factors can vary greatly, which may affect the recolonization of the typical populations in the altered area. This study evaluated the development of seedlings of pioneer mangrove species under different levels of shading in soil substrate degraded by deforestation, aiming to assess the effect of deforestation on the recolonization of mangrove forests, which may be of help in the production of seedlings and recovery of deforested areas. The study was conducted in the municipality of Acaraú in the state of Ceará, Brazil. The species Avicennia schaueriana Stapf and Leechm. ex Moldenke (1939) and Laguncularia racemosa C. F. Gaertn (1807) were used in the study, and the substrate was collected from an area impacted by deforestation. The propagules and seedlings were exposed to full sun and 30, 50 and 70% shading. The results revealed that the treatment at full sun had the lowest germination rate of 86.66% for L. racemosa. Seedlings of both species showed a significant difference and better quality between shading treatments and full sun. The height of the seedlings showed a correlation above-0.90 with ambient temperature. L. racemosa tested in full sun had a viable seedling reduction of 50% and A. schaueriana was superior. It is concluded that the natural regeneration of a mangrove area can be compromised under the conditions of total deforestation with high sun exposure and degraded soils. Human intervention in providing 50% shading is essential for the development of seedlings and regeneration of the area impacted by deforestation. © 2019, Sociedade de Investigacoes Florestais.

AB  - Limited funding is a major barrier to implementing ambitious global restoration commitments, so reducing restoration costs is essential to upscale restoration. The lack of rigorous analyses about the major components and drivers of restoration costs limit the development of alternatives to reduce costs and the selection of the most cost-effective methods to achieve restoration goals. We conducted detailed restoration cost assessments for the three most widespread biomes in Brazil (Amazon, Cerrado, and Atlantic Forest) and estimated the restoration costs associated with implementing Brazil's National Plan for Native Vegetation Recovery (12M hectares). Most surveys (60–90%) reported using the costly methods of planting seedlings or sowing seeds throughout the site, regardless of the biome. Natural regeneration and assisted regeneration approaches were an order of magnitude cheaper but were reported in <15% of projects. The vast majority of tree planting and direct seeding costs were incurred during the implementation phase, and nearly 80% of projects ended maintenance within 30 months. We estimated a price tag of US$0.7-1.2 billion per year until 2030 to implement Brazil's restoration plan depending on the area that recovers through natural regeneration. Our results offer valuable insights for developing strategies to make restoration cheaper and to increase its cost-effectiveness for achieving diverse benefits in Brazilian ecosystems. Our survey also provides a starting point for sound assessments of restoration costs and their drivers in other biomes, which are needed to reduce the financial barriers to scaling up restoration at a global scale. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Peugeot-ONF Forest Carbon Sink Project, located at Fazenda São Nicolau (FSN) in Cotriguaçu Municipality, is a public-private initiative and has been supported by several French and Brazilian institutions. Its Research Program includes studies aiming Biodiversity Conservation, Ecology, Carbon Dynamics, Silvicultural Techniques. FSN comprises a high richness of species with more than 20 new species of beetles (Histeridae, Scarabaeidae e Melolonthidae) described among them one endemic genus. A quick overview of the SuperFamily Scarabaeoidea within the FSN area registered 260 species which nearly 100 species might be new to Science. One new species of fish as well as research with amphibian toxins as tools to treat cancer and malaria are also done with material collected at the FSN. Ecology of the decomposer´s fauna at reforestation sites showed that after 10 years, such places were more similar to native forest sites than pastures or abandoned pastures. Finally large mammals studies indicated that many large mammals use FSN as a refuge. We stress the importance to keep the FSN natural habitats linked with the Juruena National Park. The FSN contour is under heavy deforestation which will increase the species loss and turn FSN in one of the few major natural vegetation fragments. © 2019, Academia Brasileira de Ciencias.

AB  - Forest fragmentation, a result of deforestation, not only decreases the amount of habitat available for wildlife, but also increases the isolation of the remaining fragments and the area of edges surrounding them. Also, deforestation often leads to the creation of a dynamic regenerating matrix where cleared land is subsequently abandoned. Here we examine the effects of fragmentation and landscape change on the nutritional condition of Amazonian rainforest birds at the Biological Dynamics of Forest Fragments Project, near Manaus, Brazil. We analyzed ptilochronology-based measurements of feather growth rate in 12 species living in fragments within a dynamic landscape over 21 years. Ptilochronology serves as an index of nutritional condition by revealing energy available for maintenance over 1–2 weeks while the feather is grown, allowing intraspecific comparison across treatments. Feather growth rate decreased in fragments surrounded by young second-growth borders but increased as fragment size and age of adjacent second-growth vegetation increased. Results from this simple, yet informative, measure of nutritional condition reveal physiological impacts of land cover change, including the response of birds to changes occurring at both local and landscape levels. Our results highlight the importance of looking beyond presence/absence data to describe fragmentation effects, and support the value of landscape-scale approaches for the conservation of tropical forest biodiversity. © 2018 Associação Brasileira de Ciência Ecológica e Conservação

AB  - To better understand the role of seed banks in ecological succession of dry forests, we compared similarities between vegetation and seed banks and assessed the relative contributions of seed dispersal and persistence in chronosequences in the Brazilian semi-arid region. To sample the standing vegetation and the seed bank, we collected data in three sites with three successional ages in each one (5 y, 25 y and 45 y). A total of 180 soil samples (three sites × three successional ages × 10 plots × two components) were collected. The composition of the seed bank was assessed by the seedling emergence method. Of 166 species identified in the standing vegetation, only 50 (30.1%) were also present in the seed bank, resulting in low similarity (Jaccard index = 0.02-0.21) and reflecting the rarity of woody species and the dominance of annuals (71% of richness). The relative importance of seed persistence and seed dispersal to seed banks composition were balanced in most cases (difference was not rejected in four out six comparisons). Those results suggest that seed banks in tropical dry forests are largely the result of high dispersal rates and the persistence of allochthonous annual species that contribute to decoupling seed bank and vegetation composition. © Cambridge University Press 2019.

AB  -                              Aiming to describe coastal Atlantic Rain Forest (ARF) regeneration dynamics, we evaluated attributes linked to soil biota and mycorrhizal symbiosis in two coastal ARF sites in Florianópolis, Southern Brazil. In each site, we selected forest transects in early regeneration (ER) and advanced regeneration (AR) stages, i.e., about 20 and 50 years without agricultural use, respectively. Soil total organic carbon (TOC) was higher in AR than in ER stage. Soil microbial biomass carbon (MBC) varied between sites and was higher in the AR than in the ER stage. Basal respiration and qCO                             2                              rates differed between sites and were, respectively, higher and lower in advanced regeneration stage areas. Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) root colonization and AM fungal spore density were higher in the ER stage, with no difference between sites. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for correlation between soil microbiological and chemical attributes showed that the variables with the most influence on sample separation for the first component were total spore number, soil MBC, root mycorrhizal colonization, and soil TOC. Soil pH, available P, and qCO                             2                              had the highest influence on the second component. This analysis separated samples by regeneration stage, and sites differed only in AR stage. PCR-DGGE analysis on DNA extracted from soil samples showed that AMF community structure differed more between sites than between regeneration stages.                          © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The objective of the present study was to evaluate the influence of internal precipitation on the composition and structure of natural regeneration in an alluvial dense ombrophilous forest in the Amazonian estuary. The data were collected from february to july 2016, in four 20 x 20m plots, subdivided into 1x1m subplots to analyze the floristic and structural composition of the regeneration and using 11 pluviometers to sample the precipitation. There was little variation in the number of individuals, families, genera and species between the rainy season and the less rainy season. Pariana campestris Aubl., Anthurium sinuatum Benth. Schott, Costus arabicus L. and Costus spicatus (Jacq.) Sw. were more representative due to anthropic impacts on the area. It was concluded that there was no influence of internal precipitation on the abundance and richness of natural regeneration species. © 2019, Universidade Federal de Pernambuco. All rights reserved.

AB  - Pioneer species have the potential to colonize disturbed environments, contributing to the establishment of other species and driving the dynamics and advancement of the structure of forest communities. The aim of this study was to assess the evolution of floristic-structural composition in the regenerating stratum of communities formed in the Mimosa scabrella Benth. understory with different ages. The study was carried out in four municipalities located in the Santa Catarina State South Plateau, on communities with different successional ages. The plot method was applied to the survey of all arboreal individuals with height ≥ 10 cm. The floristic-structural patterns found were compatible with the expected trend of Araucaria Forest successional dynamic, showing higher richness and abundance of regenerating individuals in the older understories. © 2019 Universidade Federal Rural do Rio de Janeiro (UFRRJ).

AB  - The secondary forest has a low diversity of species, however, they have major importance for the reestablishment of ecosystem functions and nutrient stocks lost from the original forests, as well as higher carbon absorption rate of the mature forests. In this study, we developed an approach using geographic object-based image analysis (GEOBIA) to classify the forest succession stages in a study area with 11,124 km2around Santarém (Pará State, Brazil). Among the results, we did 19 different classifications covering 1984 to 2016, having identified a variable pattern in the extension of two secondary succession classes (5 to 15 years, >30 years). Another relevant result was the modeling of a decision tree applicable to surface reflectance images collected by the LANDSAT satellites, processing these classifications attributes in a data mining software. © 2017 IEEE.

AB  - This study aimed to characterize of the Stryphnodendron adstringens (Mart.) Coville population to verify the viability of sustainable management in area of Savanna in the north of state Minas Gerais, Brazil country. Therefore inventoried 25 plots of 400 square meters in two places, in all was inventoried one hectare in each places. Was measured all adults individuals with diameter at breast height the 1,30 meter (DBH) ≤ 3 centimeter of barbatimão. In these plots was measured the diameter (DBH) and height (H) and subsequently for each site was evaluated: the De Liocourt quotient (q), basal area (G) and vertical stratification. The outcome showed a density of 180 and 218, mean diameters of 7,38 and 6,26 meters, mean of ‘q’ of 2,22 and 1,50 and means heights of 2,93 and 3,10 meters in two site respectively. The quotient’ De Liocourt showed imbalance in the recruitment in some classes of Site two. Although the imbalance indicated by ‘q’, the diameter distribution behaved exponentially negative as expected for native forests in the process of secondary succession. The Observed a more concentration of individuals in the middle stratum with 142 and 154 individuals in each site respectively. The conclusion this work that is although the species has distinct structure, on both sites studied the population of the barbatimão is constituted for a great number of diameter small individuals and with exclusivity of middle vertical stratum. The regenerative capacity of the specie, density height of the individuals per hectare and the horizontal and vertical structure show that there is viability to manage of the barbatimão on both sites since that their structures is maintained balanced. © 2016, Universidade Federal de Santa Maria.

AB  - Aiming to contribute to the better understanding of this kind of Pantanal forest, the results from a floristic-structural survey performed in a 1ha plot commonly classified as “Acuri Forest”, located at RPPN SESC Pantanal (Municipality of Barão de Melgaço - MT, Brazil - 16º45’S; 56º15’W) are presented. The floristic data were obtained from systematic collection of botanical material on the studied area and surroundings. The structural data were obtained from a one ha plot, divided into 100 contiguous sub-plots (10m x 10m). Inside these sub-plots, all arboreal individuals with diameter at breast high equal or greater than 5.0 cm, including palms, were identified, measured and mapped, using a coordinate system. 1224 individual ha-1 were sampled, representing 44 species, 43genus and 27 families; diversity index H’= 1.613 (var. 0.003514). The highest diversity families were Fabaceae (9 spp.), Sapindaceae e Anacardiaceae (3 spp. each), Bignoniaceae, Malvaceae, Moraceae e Rubiaceae (2 spp. each). Among the sampled species, 39 % were evergreen; 32 % semideciduous and 29% deciduous. Considering the tree individuals total (n = 440), 51 % were decíduos; 23% semideciduous and 26% evergreen. Attalea phalerata was the species with the highest structural value (VI= 121.62), due to its high density (64% of the total sampled individuals), frequency (100%) e and very high basal area (74.10 m2 ha-1). On second level of importance were Anadenanthera colubrina, Triplaris americana and Phyllostylon rhamnoide (VI= 35.41; 28.51; 18.5 respectively). The studied area was identified as very peculiar comparatively with other Seasonal Forest areas, especially because the Attalea phalerata massive density and absence of Myrtaceae representatives. The high representation of pioneer species in association with high density of individuals within this successional category reinforces that Mata com Acuri represents an early successional stage or a transitional stage. Based on the great percentage of deciduous and semi-deciduous species recorded for the area of study, it was classified as being representative of Deciduous Forest. © 2016, Universidade Federal de Santa Maria.

AB  - Large-scale forest restoration is a cornerstone of Brazil's new Forest Code and a key element in its National Determined Contribution (NDC) to emissions reduction. But the path to this target remains unclear due to a lack of information on its economics and implementation challenges. Here, we begin to fill this gap by developing a spatially-explicit model for Minas Gerais state that estimates the costs and benefits of native vegetation regeneration under different restoration approaches. Our results show that 36% (0.7 million ha) of the Forest Code debt in Minas Gerais can be restored using only passive restoration, at a cost of US$ 175 ± 47 million. Adding low-cost assisted natural regeneration would increase that number to 75% (1.5 million ha) at a cost of US$ 776 ± 137 million over a 20 yr period. This would result in a potential sequestration of 284 MtCO2e. However, including the intensive planting methods needed to restore the remaining 25% of highly degraded areas - to fully solve the Forest Code debt and result in a potential sequestration of 345 MtCO2e - would more than double the costs to US$ 1.7 ± 0.3 billion. Our results emphasize the need to implement regional policies that take advantage of the natural regeneration potential as well as prioritize the restoration of areas key to ecosystem services. © 2017 IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Tropical forests continue to be plagued by the dual sustainability challenges of deforestation and rural poverty. We seek to understand why many of the farmers living in the Brazilian Amazon, home to the world’s largest tropical agricultural-forest frontier, persist in agricultural activities associated with low incomes and high environmental damage. To answer this question, we assess the factors that shape the development and distribution of agricultural activities and farmer well-being in these frontiers. Our study utilizes a uniquely comprehensive social-ecological dataset from two regions in the eastern Brazilian Amazon and employs a novel conceptual framework that highlights the interdependencies between household attributes, agricultural activities, and well-being. We find that livestock production, which yields the lowest per hectare incomes, remains the most prevalent land use in remote areas, but many examples of high income fruit, horticulture, and staple crop production exist on small properties, particularly in peri-urban areas. The transition to more profitable land uses is limited by lagging supply chain infrastructure, social preferences, and the fact that income associated with land use activities is not a primary source of perceived life quality. Instead subjective well-being is more heavily influenced by the nonmonetary attributes of a rural lifestyle (safety, tranquility, community relations, etc.). We conclude that transitions away from low-income land uses in agricultural-forest frontiers of the Brazilian Amazon need not abandon a land-focused vision of development, but will require policies and programs that identify and discriminate households based on a broader set of household assets, cultural attributes, and aspirations than are traditionally applied. At a broader scale, access to distant markets for high value crops must be improved via investments in processing, storage, and marketing infrastructure. © 2017 by the author(s).

AB  - Ecological restoration should focus, not only on species composition, but also on the ecological functions provided by the ecosystem, mirroring the characteristics found in the reference site. In this context, plant functional traits could help to achieve this goal, as they directly affect ecosystem processes. Thus, modeling species composition based on species functional traits could provide ways to make predictions about future communities and to assess the functioning of the ecosystem. In order to evaluate how different restored communities are from their reference ecosystem, we used a trait-based modeling approach that predicts relative abundances of a community based on the functional composition of the reference ecosystem. We surveyed adult trees in the canopy and seedlings in the understory in both reference and 10 year-old restoration sites in two different locations in South of Brazil to gather information of species composition and their relative abundances. Functional composition was based on information of leaf traits for all species included in the survey. We applied the model on two different components: canopy and understory species. We found differences in functional composition between the restored communities and the reference sites, indicating that the ten-year old restored forests are still not similar to the reference ecosystem. Both the observed and the predicted understory communities were more similar to the reference ecosystem than the observed canopy communities. It indicates that species that established after restoration interventions have functional composition closer to the reference ecosystem than the set of species initially selected for planting. Modeling the community based on functional trait composition coupled with long-term monitoring of sites undergoing restoration would enable a better evaluation of restoration trajectories and management needs to modify ecosystem functions towards values found in reference sites. Restoration should focus on the recovery of functional composition, which would provide a better set of resources for organisms and promote changes in ecosystem processes. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The Atlantic Forest has been threatened by frequent human disturbances that affect its ecological processes. Lianas are an important component of tropical forest dynamics and, under chronic disturbance, may proliferate vigorously, potentially arresting secondary succession and hindering forest recovery. Our study aims to analyze abundance and diversity of liana and trees in different life stages in a disturbed semidecidual seasonal tropical forest fragment in southeast Brazil. We sampled the species richness and relative abundance in the following life stages of lianas and trees: I—seed (as seed arrival and seed bank processes), II—seedling, III—juvenile, and IV—adult. Lianas are more abundant than trees after the seedling stage, while trees showed more rarefied species richness only at the seed rain stage. Our results show that dispersal does not seem to be a bottleneck for either liana or tree community in disturbed fragments, but competition at the seedling stage may give lianas advantage over trees. Lianas may proliferate abundantly in forest fragments, even decades after disturbance. We recommend interventions for the management and restoration of disturbed forest fragments dominated by lianas to target this life form in life stages where they suppress the forest community, such as after the seedling stage. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - Due to the increasing environmental degradation, the understanding of how reforestation and other restoration techniques function became fundamental to base the reestablishment of degraded ecosystems. The aim of this study was to perform a vegetation survey in a restoration site through three different techniques. The study site has 7.2 ha in a subtropical forest in Dois Vizinhos, Paraná state, Brazil and it is approximately 20 m from a secondary forest fragment. The experiment consisted of 12 plots with three treatments (T1-3) randomly distributed in four blocks. T1: natural regeneration through passive restoration. T2: set of nucleation techniques. T3: seedlings planted through filling and diversity lines (3x2 m). For sampling purposes, each plot was divided into 24 subplots. In order to evaluate plant presence, two years and eight months after the treatments implementation, a survey was conducted in three random subplots for each plot, where all plants taller than 50cm were identified and quantified. Native species richness was higher than 87% in all treatments, whereas the presence of herbaceous species was higher at passive restoration and woody species at plantation. The most common dispersal syndromes were anemochory and zoochory. By comparing planted and regenerated individuals for the three treatments, the plantation technique had the highest Shannon diversity index (3.017), with 148 individuals and 53 species sampled. However, there was no statistically significant difference. This higher diversity is related to the larger number of species planted, but it is still not facilitating regeneration species in its understory at this age. Considering only regenerated individuals, nucleation showed the highest Shannon diversity index (2.078) with a total of 908 individuals of 40 species, however, it wasn’t statistically significant different of passive restoration (Shannon = 1.965) which had 2,018 individuals of 40 species. The most floristic similar treatments were passive restoration and nucleation. Nucleation facilitated species natural regeneration (17 planted and 40 regenerated species) while passive restoration showed high resilience, therefore the use of passive restoration can be considered an effective alternative since its results did not differ statistically from nucleation, and the main advantage of this technique is the reduced cost. © 2018, Universidade Federal de Santa Maria.

AB  - Caatinga vegetation continues to be converted into mosaics of secondary forest stands, but the affect of this process on biodiversity has not yet been examined. We used 35 regenerating and old-growth stands of Caatinga to examine the recovery of plant assemblages subsequent to slash-and-burn agriculture and cattle ranching/pasture in northeastern Brazil. Plant assemblages were contrasted in terms of community structure (stem density/basal area/species richness/diversity), functional (leaf habit/reproductive traits) and taxonomic composition. Soil attributes were also examined to infer potential drivers for cross-habitat differences. As expected, plant assemblages clearly differed across a large set of community-level attributes, including all trait categories relative to leaf habit and reproduction (pollination syndrome/floral color, size, type). Overall, old-growth forest stands supported distinct and more diverse assemblages at the plot and habitat level; e.g., long-lived tree species were almost exclusively found in old-growth forest stands. For most attributes, plant assemblages subsequent to pasture exhibited intermediate values between those exhibited by old-growth forest and those of agriculture-related stands. Surprisingly, soils exhibited similar fertility-related scores across habitats. Our results indicate that: (1) sprouting/resprouting represents an important mechanism of forest regeneration; (2) assemblage-level attributes suggest recovery at distinct rates; (3) forest regeneration implies community-level changes in both vegetative and reproductive functional attributes, including directional changes; (4) Caatinga is not able to completely recover in a period of 15-yr following land abandonment; and (5) historical land use affects recovery rates and successional pathways/taxonomic trajectories. Seasonally dry tropical forests may intrinsically cover a wide range of patterns relative to successional model, recovery rates and successional pathways. © 2016 The Association for Tropical Biology and Conservation

AB  - Secondary forests now make up more than one-half of all tropical forests, and constraints on their biomass accumulation will influence the strength of the terrestrial carbon (C) sink in the coming decades. However the variance in secondary tropical forest biomass for a given stand age and climate is high and our understanding of why is limited. We constructed a model of terrestrial C, nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) cycling to examine the influence of disturbance and management practices on nutrient limitation and biomass recovery in secondary tropical forests. The model predicted that N limited the rate of forest recovery in the first few decades following harvest, but that this limitation switched to P approximately 30-40 yr after abandonment, consistent with field data on N and P cycling from secondary tropical forest chronosequences. Simulated biomass recovery agreed well with field data of biomass accumulation following harvest (R2 = 0.80). Model results showed that if all biomass remained on site following a severe disturbance such as blowdown, regrowth approached pre-disturbance biomass in 80-90 yr, and recovery was faster following smaller disturbances such as selective logging. Field data from regrowth on abandoned pastures were consistent with simulated losses of nutrients in soil organic matter, particularly P. Following any forest disturbance that involved the removal of nutrients (i.e., except blowdown), forest regrowth produced reduced biomass relative to the initial state as a result of nutrient loss through harvest, leaching and/or sequestration by secondary minerals. Differences in nutrient availability accounted for 49-94% of the variance in secondary forest biomass C at a given stand age. Management lessons from this study are the importance of strategies that help retain nutrients on site, recognizing the role of coarse woody debris in immobilization and subsequent release of nutrients, and the potential for nutrient additions to enhance biomass growth and recovery in secondary tropical forests. © 2016 by the Ecological Society of America.

AB  - Ant diversity is influenced by the structural complexity of the environment. Ants are thus an ecologically important group due to their potential to serve as indicators of environmental quality. The objective of this study was to evaluate ant diversity in areas with different land use histories and thus, within different stages of regeneration in the Permanent Preservation Area of the Foz do Chapecó Hydroelectric Plant reservoir. Ant assemblies among sample sites were compared using rarefaction analysis, and estimated richness, frequency of occurrence, and relative abundance were calculated. Associations between species and sample sites were evaluated using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). We identified 55 species in total from 24 genera, distributed among seven subfamilies. Eight species had positive associations with sample sites. Estimates indicated that ant richness may be up to 21.4% greater than that observed. This study presents an inventory of species capable of colonizing environments undergoing natural regeneration processes, and aids our understanding of ecological recovery dynamics in protected areas near hydroelectric plant reservoirs southern Brazil. © 2017, Academia Brasileira de Ciencias.

AB  - Monitoring of natural regeneration can provide information on potential species for use in ecological restoration projects, as well as provide indications of the area resilience after degradation. In order to analyze variations of natural regeneration in two successional stages and to subsidize the indication of species for planting and enrichness, two abandoned pastures were sampled in Serra do Itajaí National Park (PNSI), Santa Catarina state, Southern Brazil. In the analysis of the main components, the plots differed according to the change in the quantitative variables of the species (Monte Carlo, P ≤ 0.05), and two groups were segregated: the first one constituted by the vegetation in the initial stage, and the second one, by intermediate stage vegetation. Twenty-one species were sampled and the intermediate stage showed the greatest richness (n = 19). The pioneer species were predominant in both stages, especially Vernonanthura discolor, Piptocarpha regnellii and Myrsine coriacea. The results demonstrate that the initial stage does not have indicator species, because all species occur frequently in the intermediate stage. However, the intermediate stage was distinguished by the presence of eight indicator species, which are potentially recommended for reforestation and enrichment plantations of Montana Ombrophilous Dense Forest in the PNSI. © 2017, ALÖKI Kft., Budapest, Hungary.

AB  - Habitat modification may change vertebrate and vector-borne disease distributions. However, natural forest regeneration through secondary succession may mitigate these effects. Here we tested the hypothesis that secondary succession influences the distribution of birds and their haemosporidian parasites (genera Plasmodium and Haemoproteus) in a seasonally dry tropical forest, a globally threatened ecosystem, in Brazil. Moreover, we assessed seasonal fluctuations in parasite prevalence and distribution. We sampled birds in four different successional stages at the peak and end of the rainy season, as well as in the middle and at the end of the dry season. A non-metric multidimensional scaling analysis revealed that bird communities in the pasture (i.e., highly modified) areas were different from those in the early, intermediate, and late successional areas (secondary forests). Among 461 individual birds, haemosporidian prevalence was higher in pasture areas than in the more advanced successional stages, but parasite communities were homogeneous across these areas. Parasite prevalence was higher in pasture-specialists birds (resilient species) than in forest-specialists species, suggesting that pasture-specialists may increase infection risk for co-occurring hosts. We found an increase in prevalence between the middle and end of the dry season, a period associated with the beginning of the breeding season (early spring) in southeastern Brazil. We also found effects of seasonality in the relative prevalence of specific parasite lineages. Our results show that natural forest recovery through secondary succession in SDTFs is associated with compositional differences in avian communities, and that advanced successional stages are associated with lower prevalence of avian haemosporidian parasites. © 2017 Ferreira Junior et al.

AB  - Natural regeneration offers a cheaper alternative to active reforestation and has the potential to become the predominant way of restoring degraded tropical landscapes at large-scale. We conducted a meta-analysis for tropical regions and quantified the relationships between both ecological and socioeconomic factors and biodiversity responses in naturally regenerating areas. Biogeographic realms, past disturbance, and the human development index (HDI) were used as explanatory variables for biodiversity responses. In addition, we present a case study of large-scale natural regeneration in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest and identify areas where different forms of restoration would be most suitable. Using our dataset for tropical regions, we showed that natural regeneration was predominantly reported within: the Neotropical realm; areas that were intensively disturbed; and countries with medium HDI. We also found that biodiversity in regenerating forests was more similar to the values found in old growth forests in: countries with either low, high, or very high HDI; less biodiverse realms; and areas of less intensive past disturbance. Our case study from Brazil showed that the level of forest gain resulting from environmental legislation, in particular the Brazilian Forest Code, has been reduced, but remains substantial. Complementary market incentives and financial mechanisms to promote large-scale natural regeneration in human-modified agricultural landscapes are also needed. Our analysis provides insights into the factors that promote or limit the recovery of biodiversity in naturally regenerating areas, and aids to identify areas with higher potential for natural regeneration. © 2016 The Association for Tropical Biology and Conservation

AB  - Timber management directly influences the population dynamics of tree species, like Copaifera spp. (copaíba), which provide oil-resin with ecological and economic importance. The aim of this study was to evaluate the structure and population dynamics of Copaifera in unmanaged and managed stands by reduced-impact logging (RIL) in eastern Amazon in Pará state, Brazil. Based on a stem map of the study area, 40 Copaifera trees were randomly selected, where an equal number of trees were selected in managed and unmanaged stands. A transect of 10 × 100 m was centered at each tree (50 m each side) to assess Copaifera regeneration. Transects were subdivided into ten plots, of which six were systematically chosen to assess the height, diameter and number of Copaifera seedlings and saplings. The field assessment occurred in 2011 and 2013. To estimate the amount of sunlight transmitted to the forest floor, we computed canopy cover from airborne LiDAR data. According to the results, the abundance of Copaifera seedlings/saplings was higher in managed than unmanaged stands. About 5% of Copaifera regeneration was found between 45-50 m from the Copaifera tree while ~73% of regeneration was concentrated within a 10 m radius of the Copaifera tree. We verified that the diameter distribution of Copaifera regeneration was not a negative exponential distribution, as is typical of most tree species in natural forest. Rather, the Copaifera regeneration had a spatially aggregated distribution. In this short-term analysis, the impact of timber management is not negatively affecting the population structure or dynamics of Copaifera regeneration. © 2017 by the authors.

AB  - Functional analysis of secondary succession may allow identifying and predicting processes of community assembly, which can be simultaneously driven by factors related to ecological filters and neutral forces. This study evaluated trait-convergence assembly patterns and trait-divergence assembly patterns in successional areas of Araucaria forest. Plant species were sampled in both the upper and lower strata and were described by 15 functional traits. Data analyses were based on multiplication and Procrustes adjustment of matrices, which permit to discriminate trait-convergence assembly patterns and trait-divergence assembly patterns along the forest succession (our environmental variable), and the influence of phylogeny on these patterns. Initial and late forests were highly different in species composition, but the regenerating stratum was already more similar especially in functional terms. Traits related to the acquisitive-conservative trade-off (wood density, leaf nitrogen content, leaf area, leaf dry matter content) revealed strong convergent patterns of successional changes. Moreover divergence was maximized by specific leaf area, seed mass, deciduousness, and dispersal mode, showing a higher functional diversity in late Araucaria forests. © 2016 Associação Brasileira de Ciência Ecológica e Conservação

AB  - The spatial and temporal distributions of vegetation can be influenced by edaphic and environmental factors as well as disturbances. The present study was undertaken to characterize the distribution and spatial dependence of species diversity in a fragment of semideciduous seasonal forest after a disturbance event by fire and to identify changes during natural regeneration. The fire, occurred in 1999, and surveys were undertaken in 2000, 2005 and 2014 in 26 geo-referenced plots (400 m²) distributed along two transects. The Fire Damage Index (FDI) in each plot was based on a scale from 0 to 5, and all of the arboreal individuals with diameters at breast height (DBH) ≥ 5 cm were identified in each plot. Species diversity was calculated using the Shannon index (H’), and species richness (S) was estimated using species accumulation curves; variations between the surveys compared based on the means and standard errors. The S, H’ and FDI data were submitted to non-spatial exploratory and geostatistical analyses. After adjusting the semivariograms, the levels of spatial dependence were classified, and interpolation of the variables values were performed using ordinary kriging to characterize their spatial distributions in the form of maps. Spatial analysis was used to identify and characterize differences between the post-fire surveys in terms of the configurations of the arboreal community. The fire event influenced the spatial and temporal structures of the variables S and H’. These variables showed spatial dependence and aggregated distributions, with reduction in the distance under spatial influences and a uniformity of individuals distribution in the forest fragment at the different surveys. This research characterized the distribution and spatial dependence of the variables S and H’ in a forest fragment after a fire event and the alterations in the arboreal community structure during natural regeneration. © 2017, Universidad de Costa Rica.

AB  - Questions: Do the assemblages of pollination modes in restored (tree plantings) and secondary (naturally regenerated) forests change in comparison to primary forests, and how do these assemblages relate to species turnover at regional scale?. Location: Southeast region of Brazil. Methods: We classified tree species found in a total of 40 forest sites (18 primary, 11 restored, 11 secondary) according to pollination mode, based on the literature. We calculated and compared functional dissimilarity distances, amounts of species and accumulated abundance of pollination modes, and functional indices of richness and evenness between forest types. Results: Functional dissimilarity distances were much smaller than species dissimilarity distances within forest types (mean <20%, >80%, respectively), indicating a small variation in pollination modes between sites. Functional indices of richness and evenness did not differ between forest types. However, significant changes were found in the species and abundance proportions of several pollination modes. Primary forests were characterized by the predominance of generalized insect-pollinated species, followed by secondary proportions of bee, wind and moth pollination; other pollination modes were underrepresented. In restored forests, reductions were found in generalized insect, moth, wind, fly, pollen-consuming insect and very-small insect pollination, whereas the species pollinated by bees and bats more than doubled. Smaller changes were found among secondary forests, including reductions in moth, fly and fig-wasp pollination, whereas there were incremental changes in bee, beetle, big animal and small insect pollination. Conclusions: Our results indicate a rather stable assemblage of pollination modes and also high ecological redundancy among trees regardless of the species replacement at the regional scale. Major changes among restored forests are probably in response to larger disturbance effects and/or restoration practices conducted in these sites. In contrast, smaller changes among secondary forests could be in response to smaller disturbance effects and natural selection processes, and also seem to suggest that highly resilient degraded areas are more likely to recuperate their functional diversity through natural regeneration alone. In both cases, however, efforts to recover such patterns should be encouraged to avoid possible negative effects in plant–pollinator interactions. © 2017 International Association for Vegetation Science

AB  - Ecological restoration aims to retrieve not only the structure but also the functionality of ecosystems. Frugivorous birds may play an important role in this process due to their efficiency in seed dispersal. Color perception in these animals is highly developed, and then the colors of fleshy fruits may provide important clues for choosing plant species for restoration plans. This study aims to integrate bird color preferences and restoration of degraded areas, with an objective to evaluate the potential attractiveness to birds by colored fruits. We carried out an experiment with 384 artificial fruits made of edible modeling clay with the following colors: black, blue, green and red, with 96 fruits of each color in six sites, including four restored areas and two second-growth forest fragments. We also tested the possible effect of light intensity on fruit consumption by color. A total of 120 (38.6%) were assumed to be consumed by birds, and the fruit consumption varied in response to the location and light incidence. Consumption of black and blue fruits was not related to site by chance. Notwithstanding, red and black fruits were consumed significantly more than any other colors, emphasizing bird preference to these colors, regardless of location. Enrichment with shade tolerant shrubs or forest species with black or red fruits may be an alternative way to manage established restorations. In recently established or new restorations, one may introduce pioneer shrubs or short-lived forest species which have blue fruits, but also those having black or red ones. © 2016, Instituto Internacional de Ecologia.

AB  - Regrowth of tropical secondary forests following complete or nearly complete removal of forest vegetation actively stores carbon in aboveground biomass, partially counterbalancing carbon emissions from deforestation, forest degradation, burning of fossil fuels, and other anthropogenic sources. We estimate the age and spatial extent of lowland second-growth forests in the Latin American tropics and model their potential aboveground carbon accumulation over four decades. Our model shows that, in 2008, second-growth forests (1 to 60 years old) covered 2.4 million km2 of land (28.1%of the total study area).Over 40 years, these lands can potentially accumulate a total aboveground carbon stock of 8.48 Pg C (petagrams of carbon) in aboveground biomass via low-cost natural regeneration or assisted regeneration, corresponding to a total CO2 sequestration of 31.09 Pg CO2. This total is equivalent to carbon emissions from fossil fuel use and industrial processes in all of Latin America and the Caribbean from1993 to 2014. Ten countries account for 95% of this carbon storage potential, led by Brazil, Colombia, Mexico, and Venezuela. We model future land-use scenarios to guide national carbon mitigation policies. Permitting natural regeneration on 40% of lowland pastures potentially stores an additional 2.0 Pg C over 40 years. Our study provides information and maps to guide national-level forest-based carbon mitigation plans on the basis of estimated rates of natural regeneration and pasture abandonment. Coupled with avoided deforestation and sustainable forestmanagement, natural regeneration of second-growth forests provides a low-costmechanism that yields a high carbon sequestration potential with multiple benefits for biodiversity and ecosystem services. © 2016 The Authors.

AB  - Forest restoration requires strategies such as passive restoration to balance financial investments and ecological outcomes. However, the ecological outcomes of passive restoration are traditionally regarded as uncertain. We evaluated technical and legal strategies for balancing economic costs and ecological outcomes of passive versus active restoration in agricultural landscapes. We focused in the case of Brazil, where we assessed the factors driving the proportion of land allocated to passive and active restoration in 42 programs covering 698,398 hectares of farms in the Atlantic Forest, Atlantic Forest/cerrado ecotone and Amazon; the ecological outcomes of passive and active restoration in 2955 monitoring plots placed in six restoration programs; and the legal framework developed by some Brazilian states to balance the different restoration approaches and comply with legal commitments. Active restoration had the highest proportion of land allocated to it (78.4%), followed by passive (14.2%) and mixed restoration (7.4%). Passive restoration was higher in the Amazon, in silviculture, and when remaining forest cover was over 50 percent. Overall, both restoration approaches showed high levels of variation in the ecological outcomes; nevertheless, passively restored areas had a smaller percentage canopy cover, lower species density, and less shrubs and trees (dbh > 5 cm). The studied legal frameworks considered land abandonment for up to 4 years before deciding on a restoration approach, to favor the use of passive restoration. A better understanding of the biophysical and socioeconomic features of areas targeted for restoration is needed to take a better advantage of their natural regeneration potential. © 2016 The Association for Tropical Biology and Conservation

AB  - In hyper fragmented biomes, conservation of extant biota relies on preservation and proper management of remnants. The maintenance of genetic diversity and functional connectivity in a landscape context is probably key to long-term conservation of remnant populations. We measured the genetic diversity in seedlings and adults of tree Copaifera langsdorffii and evaluated whether edge and density-dependent effects drive natural regeneration in a set of very small and degraded Brazilian Atlantic forest fragments. We evaluated the role of small remnants in the conservation of genetic diversity in a hyper fragmented landscape and discuss the challenge of long-term population sustainability of such altered habitats. High genetic diversity in adults indicated these fragments are valuable targets for C. langsdorffii in situ conservation, but both genetic diversity and divergence among patches decreased in seedlings. In our landscape, regeneration increased as it neared edges and adults; suggesting this population is resilient to fragmentation. However, at a broader scale, current levels of gene flow have not been sufficient to prevent the loss of genetic diversity across generations. Restoration plans, even at a small scale, are necessary to promote fragment connectivity and spatially expand opportunities for the fairly restricted gene flow observed in this severely fragmented Brazilian Atlantic forest region. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - Secondary forests are increasingly dominant in human-modified tropical landscapes, but the drivers of forest recovery remain poorly understood. Soil conditions influence plant community composition, and are expected to change over a gradient of succession. However, the role of soil conditions as an environmental filter driving community assembly during forest succession has rarely been explicitly assessed. We evaluated the role of stand basal area and soil conditions on community assembly and its consequences for community functional properties along a chronosequence of Atlantic forest regeneration following sugar cane cultivation. Specifically, we tested whether community functional properties are related to stand basal area, soil fertility and soil moisture. Our expectations were that edaphic environmental filters play an increasingly important role along secondary succession by increasing functional trait convergence towards more conservative attributes. We sampled soil and woody vegetation features across 15 second-growth (3–30 years) and 11 old-growth forest plots (300 m2 each). We recorded tree functional traits related to resource-use strategies (specific leaf area, SLA; leaf dry matter content, LDMC; leaf area, LA; leaf thickness, LT; and leaf succulence, LS) and calculated community functional properties using the community-weighted mean (CWM) of each trait and the functional dispersion (FDis) of each trait separately and all traits together. With exception of LA, all leaf traits were strongly associated with stand basal area; LDMC and SLA increased, while LT and LS decreased with forest development. Such changes in LDMC, LT and LS were also related to the decrease in soil nutrient availability and pH along succession, while soil moisture was weakly related to community functional properties. Considering all traits, as well as leaf thickness and succulence separately, FDis strongly decreased with increasing basal area and decreasing soil fertility along forest succession, presenting the lowest values in old-growth forests. Synthesis. Our findings suggest that tropical forest regeneration may be a deterministic process shaped by soil conditions. Soil fertility operates as a key filter causing functional convergence towards more conservative resource-use strategies, such as leaves with higher leaf dry matter content. © 2017 The Authors.

AB  - We evaluated the impacts of selective logging on tree regeneration one, four, and eight years after harvests in Antimary State Forest in the State of Acre, Brazil. We inventoried tree seedlings, saplings, and poles (>50 cm tall to <10 cm DBH) on secondary roads, log landing, and skid trails, as well as in the bole and crown zones of canopy gaps created by felling; for comparison we also sampled areas not affected directly by logging. We compared these habitats on the basis soil (physical) characteristics, canopy cover, and floristic composition. For areas one and four years after logging, we supplemented the ground-based information with aerial LiDAR data. By eight years post-logging the size class distributions of tree regeneration in all habitat types resembled those in unlogged areas, and densities were only lower in crown gaps. Eight years after logging, relative densities of pioneer trees were highest on secondary roads and log landings; no among habitat differences were observed in the relative densities of non-pioneer species at any time along the chronosequence. Tree species diversity (Fisher's alpha) converged on unlogged values on skid trails, bole gaps, and crown gaps at 8-years post-logging, but values remained lower on secondary roads and log landings. Canopy openness was greatest one year after logging, especially in log landings (mean 45.4 ± SE 4.5%) whereas four and eight years post-logging it did not exceed 10% and no differences were found among habitats. Soil bulk density was elevated relative to un-logged areas only on log landings one and four years after logging, and this difference disappeared by eight years post-logging. The total area disturbed by logging varied from 7.0% to 8.6% with nearly half of the totals in felling gaps (3.0–3.7%). © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Natural regeneration may be a cost-effective method for recovering areas previously used for intensive agricultural purposes. Plant diversity in the succession periods has been well documented; however, less attention has been paid to the changes in soil attributes, which may work as an instrument for the validation of regeneration methods. The present study is part of a broader interdisciplinary research project assessing the effects of natural regeneration on biodiversity and the quality of the soil. We investigated the effects of natural regeneration on the physicochemical attributes of the soil, as well as on soil organic carbon (SOC), microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and enzyme attributes. We assessed three stages and five areas of each natural regeneration stage (early-ER, intermediate-IR and late-LR) in two layers: 0–5 and 5–10 cm. The present study found a 20% SOC increase due to natural regeneration. In the first layer, SOC, urease, acid phosphatase and arylsulfatase absolute activities were significantly higher in the two older natural regeneration stages (IR and LR) than those found in the ER stage. We found a reduction in specific enzyme activities per SOC unit in the ER areas. Natural regeneration influenced SOC and MBC, the absolute enzyme activities, and the specific enzymes per SOC unit, mainly in the surface layer. The present study provided some of the first data concerning the beneficial effects of natural regeneration on the quality of soil as measured through enzyme activity, SOC and MBC in a tropical dry region in Northeastern Brazil. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Background: Haemosporidian parasites of the genera Plasmodium and Haemoproteus can have detrimental effects on individual birds and populations. Despite recent investigations into the distribution and richness of these parasites and their vertebrate hosts, little is known about their dipteran vectors. The Neotropics has the highest diversity of mosquitoes in the world, but few studies have tried to identify vectors in this area, hampering the understanding of the ecology of avian malaria in the highly diverse Neotropical environments. Methods: Shannon traps and active collection were used to capture 27,110 mosquitoes in a Seasonally Dry Tropical Forest in southeastern Brazil, a highly endangered ecosystem. Results: We screened 17,619 mosquito abdomens from 12 different species and several unidentified specimens of Culex, grouped into 1,913 pools, for the presence of haemosporidians. Two pools (out of 459) of the mosquito Mansonia titillans and one pool (out of 29) of Mansonia pseudotitillans were positive for Plasmodium parasites, with the detection of a new parasite lineage in the former species. Detected Plasmodium lineages were distributed in three different clades within the phylogenetic tree revealing that Mansonia mosquitoes are potential vectors of genetically distant parasites. Two pools of Culex spp. (out of 43) were positive for Plasmodium gallinaceum and closely related lineages. We found a higher abundance of these putative vectors in pasture areas, but they were also distributed in areas at intermediate and late successional stages. One pool of the mosquito Psorophora discrucians (out of 173) was positive for Haemoproteus. Conclusions: The occurrence of different Plasmodium lineages in Mansonia mosquitoes indicates that this genus encompasses potential vectors of avian malaria parasites in Brazil, even though we did not find positive thoraces among the samples tested. Additional evidence is required to assign the role of Mansonia mosquitoes in avian malaria transmission and further studies will add information about evolutionary and ecological aspects of avian haemosporidia and untangle the diversity of their vectors in Brazil. © 2016 The Author(s).

AB  - The Pinus taeda trees - introduced in Brazil in 1880 and in experimental trials in 1936 - have been listed in specialized literature of biological invasion process in some areas of general fields and altitude of the states of Parana and Santa Catarina such as, the savanna in the state São Paulo, sandbar in the state of Santa Catarina and pampas in the state of Rio Grande do Sul. The annual tree-rings formed in the wood of Pinus taeda trees constitute an important tool in the evaluation of the biological invasion process. The present study aimed to evaluate the spatial-temporal dispersion of seeds by analyzing the tree-rings of Pinus taeda trees from plantations and natural regeneration in the region of Faxinal do Céu, state of Paraná. The results allowed determining the age and growth rate of the pine trees trunk from plantations; the date of germination, the seed dispersal area and the growth rate of trees of natural regeneration. The results allow, likewise discussing the invasion process of pine trees by seed dispersal in areas close to forest plantations.

AB  - Knowledge about litterfall and its nutrient fluxes is important for understanding ecosystem dynamics, especially in regards to vegetation at different succession stages. Regenerating vegetation represents a large proportion of tropical forests, such as the caatinga dry forest in NE Brazil, which is heavily used for fuel wood and slash-and-burn agriculture. In the present study we measured litterfall for 2 years in four regeneration stages of caatinga: recently abandoned pasture, 15-, 37-, and 57-years (mature caatinga) of regeneration. The lowest litter C fluxes were observed in pasture sites but the highest fluxes occurred in the intermediate regeneration stages (15 and 37 years of regeneration) than in the mature caatinga. The 15-year site had the highest concentrations and the greatest fluxes of nitrogen and phosphorus. Nutrient concentrations in litter were in the range of those found in other dry forests, but the fluxes were lower. The high N:P concentration ratios indicate that P is a limiting nutrient in this ecosystem. The proportion of total litterfall C fluxes relative to total C stocks in the ecosystem decreased consistently with succession age, but annual net C accumulation in the ecosystem increased with succession age. The results suggest that litterfall in earlier regeneration stages is more strongly affected by rainfall variation than mature vegetation, but these patterns need to be further investigated for longer periods. This higher stability of mature ecosystems could be important in face of the expected higher climatic variability in the future. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - This study aimed to evaluate open source softwares in order to classify secondary successional forest stages in Shade Tolerant Mixed Forest (FOM) environments in Southern Brazil. Two test sites were selected in the mountainous region of Santa Catarina State. We used scenes from the airborne system for acquisition and post-processing of images (SAAPI) with a spatial resolution of 0.39m. The dataset consists of orthorectified images containing three spectral bands in the visible range (i.e. 0.38-0.70pm), three spectral bands in the near infrared (i.e. 0.76- 0.78pm) and a digital surface model. The methodologies were developed using feature selection and decision tree algorithms in the following open source softwares: InterlMAGE, WEKA and QGIS. The results were satisfactory to classify successional stages of FOM as well as other classes of land use and land corer. The obtained Kappa indices ranged from 0.53 to 0.59 and the conditional Kappa varied from 0.29 to 0.83 for the successional forest stages. These results demonstrate the potential of these approaches for the extraction of information in high spatial resolution imagery as well as the possibility of providing subsidies for the implementation of public policies and monitoring of forest resources.

AB  - Our aim was to analyze areas of Atlantic rainforest after clearcutting with different types of management (pasture establishment followed (PA) by abandonment and simple abandonment (NR)). We then compared composition parameters, structure and ecological processes with native forest as a reference. Our study was conducted in Sete Barras municipality, São Paulo State, Brazil. Data collection was performed six years after clearcutting, including all woody plants found in two strata (DBH (diameter at 1.3 m soil) ≥5cm and DBH<5cm and height ≥1.5m, respectively). PA and RN showed lower values of richness, density, basal area, and diversity index (H´) when compared with F for both strata. Thus, independently of management type, six years of abandonment were not enough to recover the parameters analyzed, compared to native forest. Type of management influences ecological succession and structural parameters considering the second strata only. © 2016, Sociedade de Investigacoes Florestais. All rights reserved.

AB  - The Brazilian Atlantic Forest is widely recognized for its high levels of biodiversity and endemism. Its vast region concentrates also a large number of small farmers, who historically have been practicing swidden-fallow cultivation. Globally, there is contradictory evidence of the current fate of this traditional, integrated agricultural system, and the new land uses may have a strong impact on farmers’ livelihoods and ecosystem conservation. In this study, we assessed the land cover and land use change in a watershed where slash-and-burn cultivation was prevalent, aiming at understanding the drivers of change and discussing past and possible future impacts, including the perception of farmers on the drivers of land use change. We combined information gathered from interviews with 15 key informant farmers and from the analysis of remote sensing images for the years 1957, 1978 and 2011. Swidden-fallow cultivation has declined steadily since the 1950s. Part of the land was abandoned and forest succession was allowed to occur, increasing the total forest area; an apparently positive outcome. However, conversion to pastures and Eucalyptus plantations not only used much of the open land but also converted successional forests through deforestation, based on remote sensing. The willingness of farmers to grow more Eucalyptus and raise more cattle further increases concerns about the prospect for conservation. Our approach, combining remote sensing-based land change quantification and interviews, revealed to be complementary, allowing a better understanding of the past and possible future scenarios for the land use dynamics. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The neotropical bracken fern Pteridium arachnoideum (Kaulf.) Maxon. (Dennstaedtiaceae) is described as an aggressive pioneer plant species. It invades abandoned or newly burned areas and represents a management challenge at these invaded sites. Native to the Atlantic Forest and Cerrado (Tropical Savanna) Brazilian biomes, P. arachnoideum has nevertheless become very problematic in these conservation hotspots. Despite some reports suggesting a possible role of allelopathy in this plant's dominance, until now there has been little evidence of isolated and individually identified compounds with phytotoxic activities present in its tissues or in the surrounding environment. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the allelopathic potential of P. arachnoideum by isolating and identifying any secondary metabolites with phytotoxic activity in its tissues, litter, and soil. Bioguided phytochemical investigation led to the isolation and identification of the proanthocyanidin selligueain A as the major secondary compound in the green fronds and litter of this fern. It is produced by P. arachnoideum in its green fronds, remains unaltered during the senescence process, and is the major secondary compound present in litter. Selligueain A showed phytotoxic activity against the selected target species sesame (Sesamum indicum) early development. In particular, the compound inhibited root and stem growth, and root metaxylem cell size but did not affect chlorophyll content. This compound can be considered as an allelochemical because it is present in the soil under P. arachnoideum patches as one of the major compounds in the soil solution. This is the first report of the presence of selligueain A in any member of the Dennstaedtiaceae family and the first time an isolated and identified allelochemical produced by members of the Pteridium species complex has been described. This evidence of selligueain A as a putative allelochemical of P. arachnoideum reinforces the role of allelopathy in the dominance processes of this plant in the areas where it occurs. © 2016 de Jesus Jatoba et al.

AB  - Fipronil is an insecticide used for termite control in forest plantations. Although pest species need to be restricted, the effects on non-target termites are unknown. The effects of fipronil application on the termite community composition, species richness and functional group diversity were assessed in four different treatment plots (new eucalyptus plantations respectively treated and untreated with fipronil; naturally regenerating secondary forest and the parent native Brazilian savanna) at three different times (90 days before and 90 and 180 days following) clonal seedling planting. A total of 53 termites species belongs to families Termitidae and Rhinotermitidae were collected. The mean richness of termite species differed significantly among the treatments and times. Grass feedings showed the highest overall richness in the plot under natural regeneration 90 days before planting. Soil feedings had higher richness in the control treatment (native savanna) and in the plot under regeneration at 180 days after planting. No significant differences in richness of wood feedings termites were detected in any comparison. Termite assemblage composition in the new eucalyptus plantations did not differ between the fipronil-treated and fipronil-untreated plots. © 2016

AB  - Interspecific interactions are considered to be important structuring forces in early successional vegetation. Whereas competition seems to prevail in less severe environments, facilitation tends to increase in importance in harsh environments. Hence, facilitation is expected to play an important role in degraded tropical areas with high irradiance, heat loads, and evapotranspiration, where conditions are far from optimum for most forest species. We planned a restoration project on the southeastern Brazilian coastal plain to compare growth and survival of tree seedlings planted at two densities (isolated or aggregated) in a factorial experiment with nutrient addition. We monitored survival, height, ground level diameter, and crown projection of 4132 saplings from 19 species that ranged along a successional gradient, over an 18-month period. We used mixed-effect models to analyze the relationship between species performance and treatments, and Akaike's information criterion (AIC) to select the models. The best model showed higher survival in aggregated plantations (indicating facilitation) for non-pioneer (slower growing) species. In contrast, we found lower diameter growth in aggregated plantation (indicating competition). Fertilizer addition did not affect survival in clusters, but, surprisingly, it had a negative effect on isolated plants of both pioneer and non-pioneer species. Fertilizer addition had a positive effect on diameter and crown projection growth in aggregated plantations (reducing competition), especially for pioneer species. Thus, whether facilitation or competition was the predominant interaction depended on the effect analyzed. As establishment of non-pioneer species in disturbed sites can be challenging, restoration designs could take advantage of higher survival rates in clusters and use resource addition to ameliorate growth and decrease competition for limited resources. © 2016

AB  - Topsoil translocation has been effective for the restoration of plant communities, but until recently this method had not been used for tropical dry forest restoration. We tested different methods of topsoil deposition for restoring a dry forest on an abandoned limestone quarry. We also tested the effects of irrigation during the first dry season after topsoil deposition. The study was conducted in the Federal District of Brazil. A 2.1-ha area was cleared of vegetation, and the topsoil from that site was deposited on an exotic pasture field 1.4 km away. First, a secondary forest was clear-cut, and the first 30 cm of topsoil were removed and translocated. The soil was transported in dump trucks to the deposition site, which had been scarified in advance, and deposited by either forming 1.25-m-tall mounds or by leveling the soil into a 40-cm or 20-cm deep layer using a hydraulic excavator. The seed bank and the availability of root and stem fragments in the soil were both surveyed. The origin of the regenerants was categorized as either from seed or resprouting. We estimated vegetation cover for each life form, and measured all trees and lianas. After six months, 74% of the tree individuals and 60% of the liana individuals came from resprouting. Ruderal herbs and shrubs germinated from seeds. After 28 months, there were 51 species of trees, 8 species of lianas, 12 species of shrubs, and 34 species of herbs in the deposition treatments. The three deposition treatments were thickly covered with herbaceous/shrubby species, and had nine times the number of species (44 vs. 5) and five times the tree density (1.17 ind./m2 vs. 0.25 ind./m2) as the non-deposition control. Tree survival was relatively high in both the non-irrigated and irrigated treatments. The total cost of topsoil translocation was 9604 USD, and the output was 0.43 ha deposited/ha excavated when forming mounds of soil, 5951 USD and output of 0.75 when leveling to a 40-cm layer, and 3551 USD and 1.5 for a 20-cm layer of deposited material. However, deposition and transportation costs are fixed costs of establishing a new quarry that can be deducted from the total cost of restoration. Topsoil translocation was effective in kick-starting the succession process of a tropical dry forest. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Changes in species composition during the succession of ecological communities potentially reflect the differential effects of environmental filters and limiting similarity on structuring communities. As ecological succession can represent community assembly in action, understanding how successional time affects the functional and phylogenetic structure of communities can reveal the influence of different factors on the assembly process. We analysed functional patterns of multiple traits related to the succession of tropical forests to answer if there are trait convergence and/or divergence with regeneration age, and if functional and phylogenetic diversity can be predicted by forest age. We compiled checklists from studies of 23 successional forests in Brazilian Atlantic Forest, ranging from 4 to 120 years old. We also compiled functional traits for a total of 355 species. We analysed the data by a method that includes scaling-up trait-based data to the community level and matrix correlations of multiple traits. We built linear models to show the relationship between each trait and diversity (taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic) with successional time. We found no phylogenetic signal at the species pool and metacommunity levels, but significant trait divergence (tree guild, leaf slenderness, leaf area, pollination entomophilous generalist and pollination by vertebrate) and trait convergence (arboreal habitus, tree guild, leaf compoundness, pollination entomophilous generalist) patterns related to the successional gradient. Also, functional diversity increased during succession, with a significant increase in leaf slenderness and zoochoric dispersal and decrease in tree guild. Phylogenetic diversity also increased along the successional gradient. We found that the communities in the studied successional gradient are structured by both environmental (measured by trait convergence) and biotic (measured by trait divergence) filtering. The species turnover and diversification at taxonomic level are followed by well-defined patterns of trait turnover, revealing that community assembly is constrained by environmental filters at the beginning and by limiting similarity at the advanced stages of the succession.[[ampi]copy;Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest.

AB  - Riparian areas are a recurrent focus of ecological restoration due to their importance for the maintenance of ecosystem services. However, few studies have evaluated the success of active interventions in restoring ecosystem functions and processes. The natural regeneration is a successional process and its evaluation might reveal the state and the potential of the ecosystem resilience in forest areas undergoing restoration. The present study aimed to compare natural regeneration of a riparian area that is undergoing restoration (planting of native trees, 10 years ago) with a reference forest area, in Cachoeirinha, Rio Grande do Sul state, Brazil. We conducted a survey of trees and shrubs in the upper stratum (DBH ≥ 5 cm) and the lower stratum (> 30 cm in height and DBH > 5 cm) in a total of 40 plots (100 m2 each), within the planting (restoration) and the remnant forest (reference). For each stratum and treatment (reference vs. restoration) we analyzed phytosociological parameters, patterns of structure and composition, and similarity among plots. The results showed significant differences in relation to structure and species composition, especially for the upper stratum. For the lower stratum (natural regeneration), abundance, height, and species richness were similar between the restoration and the reference areas. Species composition in regeneration remained distinct. However, its similarity value was higher than any other comparison among strata, indicating that species that were not planted were able to establish in the planted areas. © 2017 Ciência Florestal, Santa Maria, All right reserved.

AB  - The soil seed bank is an important ecological component in forest regeneration. In semiarid regions, forest regeneration is highly affected by seasonal and interannual variations in precipitation, because these variations may affect the composition, species richness, and density of seeds in the soil. This study aimed to characterize and compare these parameters of the germinable seed bank in fragments of young and mature Caatinga forest between various seasons and over consecutive years. A total of 105 soil samples were collected in 20 × 20 × 5 cm plots in each forest (Young and Mature) at the end of the rainy and dry seasons over 4 years (2009-2012), totaling 840 samples. The composition, species richness, and density of seeds were determined by the method of seedling emergence. Over the 4 years, 121 species emerged from the soil seed bank, 86 in the young forest, and 109 in the mature forest. Significant differences in the composition, richness, and density were recorded between forests, seasons, and years, with a significant interaction between them. Relationship between rainfall and age of forests affects the dynamics of the soil seed bank in semiarid environments, which are important distinctions for the maintenance of these areas. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This study identified the main biological mechanisms governing the diversity of ants on different ecological time scales. Ants were sampled in 15 plots distributed in early, intermediate and late stages of succession (five plots per stage) at the Parque Estadual da Mata Seca, Brazil. At each sample point, unbaited pitfall traps were installed in hypogaeic, epigaeic and arboreal strata. We collected 95 ant species from 26 genera and nine subfamilies. Our results indicated that there was an increase in species richness in advanced stages of succession. We also observed that ant assemblages were different among successional stages. For the arboreal and epigaeic strata, species richness did not change with succession progression, but species composition of these two strata differed among successional stages. Unlike to arboreal and epigaeic ants, hypogaiec ant species richness was higher in the intermediate and late stages of succession and the composition of hypogaeic ants differed among successional stages. Similarity between ant species foraging in arboreal and epigaeic strata decreases with succession progression and ß-diversity was higher in advanced successional stages. Additionally, species richness was higher in the dry season, whereas the composition of ant assemblages did not change between seasons. A considerable fraction of the ant assemblage was found only in advanced stages of succession, demonstrating the importance of secondary habitats in maintaining biodiversity in dry forests.

AB  - The ecological resilience of abandoned pastures has important implications for the potential of passive restoration in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, especially in the face of the ambitious restoration targets for this biodiversity hotspot. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the influence of past land-use on natural regeneration in two secondary forests that established on abandoned pastures with different land use histories (Abandoned + Fire—15 years since the last fire event and Abandoned—36 years ago) in a lowland Brazilian Atlantic Forest. Both secondary forests exhibit low resilience for the three analyzed attributes: vegetation structure, richness, and species composition. Secondary forests affected by fire have the lowest values for species richness, aboveground biomass and leaf area index compared to old-growth forests. Secondary forests were dominated by Moquiniastrum polymorphum—Asteraceae, which was absent from the old-growth forests. Fire resistance, capacity to establish in nutrient-poor soils and efficient seed dispersal in human-modified landscapes are important attributes that may explain the dominance of this species. We demonstrate that even in sites considered appropriate for passive restoration a priori (e.g. located in a protected area, 36 years since abandonment and close to old-growth forests), secondary forests exhibited low aboveground biomass and communities were dominated by few species. Therefore, our results highlight the effects of past land-use on natural regeneration and suggest the necessity to use interventions such as enrichment plantings, nucleation techniques and assisted natural regeneration in order to accelerate forest restoration. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - In recent decades, ecosystem theory has revisited the meaning of human action. There is a growing tendency to recognize that, once “left alone”, human modified ecosystems do not return to their primitive state. Recently, this notion has been radically advocated by a group of ecologists who propose the concept of “emerging” or “novel” ecosystems. Emerging ecosystems are the direct result of either intense human modification of preserved ecosystems or the abandonment of established land uses (crops, pastures, planted forests etc.). These ecosystems present locally unprecedented patterns of species composition and dominance that don’t depend on human intervention for its maintenance. Therefore these novel ecosystems “exist as a non-regressive consequence of human activity”. In addressing the current manifestations of novel ecosystems, we adopt the retrospective method of historical geography, taking the landscape not only as a means but also as an end; more than mere instrument of knowledge, it is the object of knowledge. In this case, we visit the past only to fetch the explanatory elements of the present. Adopting this strategy, we proceed in the same way that natural scientists working in the evolutionary field (geologists, paleontologists, etc.): performing a “remote sensing of processes through surviving structures”. More specifically, we use present residual structures (e.g. novel ecosystems) to reconstruct the past processes of landscape transformation. In this article, we aim to reconstruct the processes that produced two of the largest urban forests of today’s world, both located in granite-gneiss massifs of Rio de Janeiro city, southeastern Brazil: Tijuca Massif and Pedra Branca Massif, both comprising, respectively, a National Park and a State Park. Currently, these two forest areas have particular ecological characteristics. Hiking on the slopes of Tijuca, it is easy to find whole tracts dominated by the exotic jackfruit (Artocarpus heterophyllus Lam.), which had been originally introduced in those slopes in the mid-nineteenth century, when a reforestation project began to reclaim the lands degraded by coffee plantation and timber extraction. More hardly noticeable are the small plateaus of blackened soil, evidence of an ancient industry, essential to the past urban economy: charcoal manufacture. The residues of this activity, however, are much more common in the west, in Pedra Branca. There, one of the authors has discovered, through archaeological work, over a thousand old charcoal kilns with a local influence in species composition and dominance. To notice the conspicuous presence of the banana (Musa paradisiaca L.), however, one needs no digging. Planted decades ago in any place accessible by a mule – on the backs of which the succulent and nutritious fruits traveled to less rugged terrain, where they were collected by trucks – many of these herbs-that-want-to-be-trees remain in the landscape after being abandoned by their growers, generating hybrid banana-forest systems. These are examples of how human societies as they spatialize themselves – a necessary condition of their existence in time –, leave behind the clues to their own historical intelligibility. However, this dynamic of social reproduction and understanding would never be possible if only humans were involved. Human beings and their societies emerge as such only in an open and dynamic relationship with what is non-human – other animals, plants, minerals etc., and their particular ways of being. In other words, these are more-than-human social regimes whose development is dependent on both human agency and earth systems. Thus, the emerging ecosystem approach constitutes a new way of “reading” the landscape, one that weaves together the human and non-human worlds into a coherent environmental history of the present social-ecological system. © 2017, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.

AB  - The passive restoration induced by nuclei of Clidemia urceolata affects the successional dynamics of ecosystems, and these in turn influence the physical and chemical characteristics of soils depleted by disturbed pastures, creating a positive synergy between the soil and the vegetation. This study evaluated the physical and chemical properties of the top 30 cm of the soil. This was carried out at the Federal Institute of Rio de Janeiro (IFRJ), Pinheiral Center, in the municipality of Pinheiral, state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, at five sampling sites with similar soil and physical environments. All the sites were pastures abandoned for different periods: 3 years of passive restoration (Site 1), 8 years (i.e., in an initial stage of colonization by plants; Site 2), 14 years (i.e., in an intermediate stage of colonization by plants; Site 3), 19 years (i.e., in an advanced stage of colonization by plants; Site 4), and 34 years (i.e., covered by fragments of secondary forest; Site 5). The following parameters were measured in the center of each site: a) mechanical resistance of the soil to penetration, b) apparent density, c) total porosity, d) macroporosity, e) microporosity, f) hydraulic conductivity, and g) nutrient content. The greatest contrasts in soil data were registered between 0 and 10 cm of depth, demonstrating the soil restoration done by the vegetation during passive restoration over 34 years. The development of Clidemia urceolata after 14 years is a key determinant of soil recovery, which modified its physical and chemical properties and created conditions for the environment to permit the growth and development of tree species, and the formation of forest fragments in less than 34 years of passive restoration, with no need of any additional efforts for the restoration of the disturbed areas. © 2018, Fundacao de Pesquisas Florestais do Parana.; A restauração passiva promovida pelos núcleos de Clidemia urceolata influencia na dinâmica sucessional dos ecossistemas e estes, nas características físicas e químicas dos solos empobrecidos pelas pastagens perturbadas, criando sinergia positiva entre solo e vegetação. Este estudo avaliou as propriedades físicas e químicas do solo nos primeiros 30 cm de profundidade. Ele foi feito no Instituto Federal do Rio de Janeiro (IFRJ - Núcleo Pinheiral) em cinco sítios amostrais com solos e atributos do meio físico similares, sendo todos derivados de pastagens abandonadas em diferentes períodos: Sítio 1 (3 anos de restauração passiva, pastagem abandonada); Sítio 2 (8 anos, estádio inicial de colonização); Sítio 3 (14 anos, estádio intermediário de colonização), Sítio 4 (19 anos, estádio avançado de colonização); e Sítio 5 (34 anos, fragmento de floresta secundária). Os seguintes parâmetros foram mensurados no centro dos núcleos: a) Resistência mecânica do solo à penetração; b) Densidade aparente; c) Porosidade total; d) Macroporosidade; e) Microporosidade; f) Condutividade Hidráulica; e g) Nutrientes. Os maiores contrastes de dados do solo foram registrados entre 0 e 10 cm de profundidade, evidenciando os trabalhos edafogênicos da vegetação na restauração passiva ao longo de 34 anos. O desenvolvimento de Clidemia urceolata após os 14 anos constituiu um fator diferencial na recuperação do solo, modificando suas propriedades físicas e químicas. Além disso, criou condições para que o meio permitisse abrigar e desenvolver espécies arbóreas e formar fragmento florestal em menos de 34 anos de restauração passiva, sem necessidade de adição de energia para restaurar áreas perturbadas. © 2018, Fundacao de Pesquisas Florestais do Parana.

AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the deposition of litterfall and nutrients under different forest restoration methods in areas degraded by bauxite mining in the municipality of Paragominas, state of Pará, Brazil. The methods used for forest restoration were: planting of tree seedlings (PM) and induction of natural regeneration (RN); in addition, a forest fragment (FF) was evaluated as reference. 30 litter collectors with 0.25 m2 opening were installed in each room. The material was chemically analyzed to obtain the concentrations of the chemical elements N, P, K, Ca, Mg, S, Fe, Mn, Cu, and Zn. The values of the contents were obtained by means of the concentration values. The litterfall deposition was 6.61 ± 0.53, 10.75 ± 0.86 and 11.83 ± 1.00 Mg ha-1 yr-1 for PM, FF and RN respectively, differing statistically from each other (p = 0.0025). The concentration of N, P, K, Mg and Ca was higher in the PM area in most assessment months due to planting fertilization. The S was the element that varied the most among the study areas. Regarding micronutrients, Cu, Fe, Zn and Mn had the lowest concentration in FF, and Mn had the highest concentrations in the RN ecosystem. The contents of N and K of the litter were higher in the RN ecosystems, not differing from the FF. The RN was the most efficient method of restoration. Litterfall is a good indicator of restoration of degraded areas. © 2018, Fundacao de Pesquisas Florestais do Parana.

AB  - The industrialization of the Paraíba Valley, Brazil has been driven since the 1950s by an intense urbanization process, while municipalities located far from the valley's economic center stagnated. Despite the economic differences and unequal population distribution in the region, the municipalities share similar topographic characteristics with a predominance of hilly terrains. The depletion of the soils' productive capacity after numerous land use cycles without adequate management practices was a common cause of land use abandonment. This research analyzes land use/cover data, environmental policies, census-based data, and interviews with stakeholders, to understand the factors that account for a forest transition in the Paraíba Valley where gains in forest cover more than offset any remaining deforestation. Local conditions, such as topography, land use history, environmental policies, engagement of society in complying with legal regulations, commodity markets, and the action of enforcement agencies, represent dimensions which, combined, have boosted forest transitions. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The Amazon Rainforest plays major roles in global carbon and nitrogen cycling. Despite this region's immense importance, deforestation and pasture creation are still occurring at alarming rates. In this study, we investigated the effects of land-use change on aerobic ammonia-oxidizers in primary rainforest, young and old pasture, and secondary forest in Rondônia, Brazil. Forest-to-pasture conversion decreased soil nitrate, phosphorus, and exchangeable acidity contents that recovered to pre-disturbance levels as pastures aged or were abandoned and formed secondary forest. The ammonia-oxidizing community, numerically dominated by thaumarchaea, shifted due to land-use change, both in terms of gene abundance and community structure. However, thaumarchaeal ammonia monooxygenase gene abundances did not correlate with any measured soil physicochemial parameters. Phylogenetic analyses showed that community structural changes in ammonia-oxidizing thaumarchaea are driven by a shift away from primary rainforest, old pasture, and secondary forest clusters to separate clusters for young pasture. Additionally, the nearly complete disappearance in young pasture, old pasture, and secondary forest sites of a thaumarchaeal genus, the Nitrosotalea, indicates that land-use change can have long lasting effects on large portions of the thaumarchaeal community. The results of this study can be used as a conceptual foundation for determining how ammonia-oxidizers become altered by land-use change in South American tropical forests. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Questions: Secondary succession in the tropics can follow alternative pathways. Land-use history is known to engender alternative successional communities, but the underlying mechanisms driving and sustaining divergence remain unclear. In this study we aim to answer the following questions: (1) does previous land use act as a filter for species composition in secondary forests; and (2) what are the relative roles of management practices, soil properties and landscape composition in determining species composition?. Location: Central Amazon, Brazil. Methods: We sampled trees, shrubs and palms (≥1cm diameter) in 38 early secondary forests (5 yr after abandonment) located along gradients of land-use intensity in five shifting cultivation landscapes. We measured the diameter and height of each sampled plant, identified it to species or morpho-species level and checked if it was resprouting or not. At each secondary forest we also collected soil samples for chemical and physical analyses and estimated the amount of old-growth forest surrounding it (landscape composition). Results: We found that previous land-use intensity determined species composition. With increasing land-use intensity, management practices of cut-and-burn and associated reduction in soil quality filtered out seed-dependent species and favoured strong sprouters and species that can cope with low nutrient availability. Landscape composition had a weak effect on species assemblages. We found specific species assemblages and indicator species associated with different levels of previous land-use intensity. As a consequence of these local filters, species α- and β-diversity decreased and therefore early successional communities became more similar to each other. Conclusion: Species composition of successional forests is strongly determined by different land-use intensities. Dispersal limitation has a limited effect on determining the composition of the dominant species. Filtering effects of management practices and soil quality determine the species dominating the canopy at early stages of succession and narrow down the range of species able to colonize and establish. This study highlights how land use shapes successional communities and suggests that alternative successional pathways are determined at early stages of succession. Therefore, accounting for land-use history is crucial to improve the understanding of tropical secondary succession. We present a list of indicator species for different levels of previous land-use intensity that can be used to support conservation and restoration decisions in the Amazon. © 2016 The Authors.

AB  - Forest degradation is the long-term and gradual reduction of canopy cover due to forest fire and unsustainable logging. A critical consequence of this process is increased atmospheric carbon emissions. Although this issue is gaining attention, forest degradation in the Brazilian Amazon has not yet been properly addressed. The claim here is that this process is not constant throughout Amazonia and varies according to colonization frontiers. Moreover, the accurate characterization of degradation requires lengthy observation periods to track gradual forest changes. The forest degradation process, the associated timeframe, spatial patterns, trajectories, and extent were characterized in the context of the Amazon frontiers of the 1990s using 28 years (1984-2011) of annual Landsat images. Given the large database and the characteristic of logging and burning, this study used data mining techniques and cell approach classification to analyze the spatial patterns and to construct associated trajectories. Multitemporal analysis indicated that forest degradation in the last two decades has caused as many interannual landscape changes as have clear-cuts. In addition, selective logging, as a major aspect of forest degradation, affected a larger amount of forest land than did forest fire. Although a large proportion of logged forest was deforested in the following years, selective logging did not always precede complete deforestation. Instead, the results indicate that logged forests were abandoned for approximately 4 years before clearance. Throughout the forest degradation process, there were no recurrent forest fires, and loggers did not revisit the forest. Forest degradation mostly occurred as a result of a single selective logging event and was associated with low-intensity forest damage. © 2016, American Meteorological Society. All rights reserved.

AB  - Floristic surveys and diversity indices are often applied to measure tree species diversity in mixed tropical forest remnants. However, these analyses are frequently limited to the overall results and do not allow to evaluate the spatial variability distributions of tree diversity, leading to develop additional tools. This study aimed to estimate the spatial variability of tree diversity and map their spatial patterns in a Brazilian mixed tropical forest conservation area. We used indices to measure the tree species diversity (dbh ≥ 10 cm) in 400 sampling units (25 m x 25 m) from a continuous forest inventory. Semivariograms were fitted to estimate spatial dependences and punctual kriging was applied to compose maps. Mean diversity values were constant in the continuous inventories, indicating a forest remnant in an advanced stage of ecological succession. On the other hand, tree diversity presented spatial patterns identified by geostatistics, in which the dynamics were composed of heterogeneous mosaics spatially influenced by tree species with different ecological features and densities, gap dynamics, advancement of forest succession, mortality, and Araucaria angustilofia’s cohorts. © 2018, Academia Brasileira de Ciencias.

AB  - Context: Despite continued forest cover losses in many parts of the world, Atlantic Forest, one of the largest of the Americas, is increasing in some locations. Economic factors are suggested as causes of forest gain, while enforcement has reduced deforestation. Objectives: We examine three aspects of this issue: the relative importance of biophysical versus anthropogenic factors in driving forest dynamics; role of forest mean patch age influencing areas targeted for losses; and what future forest mean patch age mosaic we can expect (more forest cover and full forest maturity?). Methods: Three land cover maps from 1990, 2000 and 2010, were used in the study. We selected six biophysical and six anthropogenic spatial determinants to analyze by means of weights of evidence, using Dinamica software. Results: Results show that forest regrowth is influenced by multiple factors, working in synergy. Biophysical variables are related to forest gain while anthropogenic are associated with loss. Clear patterns of regrowth on pasture and sugarcane plantations occurred, especially near rivers and forest patches, on steeper slopes and with sufficient rainfall. Forest loss has targeted both older and newer forests. Future projections reveal forest gain in a slow pace, followed by specific ecosystem service losses, due to continuous trends of older mature forest loss. Conclusions: Regrowth is linked to land abandonment, and to neighboring environmental conditions. It is important to question which mechanisms will guarantee and potentiate new regrowth, thus contributing to landscape restoration and reestablishment of ecosystem services in the Atlantic Forest. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - Debate about the conservation value of secondary habitats has tended to focus on tropical forests, increasingly recognizing the role of secondary forests for biodiversity conservation. However, there remains a lack of information about the conservation value of secondary savannas. Here, we conducted a camera trap survey to assess the effect of secondary vegetation on large mammals in a Brazilian Cerrado protected area, using a single-season occupancy framework to investigate the response of individual species (species-level models) and of all species combined (community-level models). In addition, we investigated the cost effectiveness of different sampling designs to monitor globally threatened species in the study area. At the community level, savanna that regenerated from eucalyptus plantation had similar occupancy estimate as old growth areas. At the species level, none of the ten species individually assessed seemed to respond to succession stage, with greater support for the effect of other covariates on occupancy, such as distance from water and vegetation physiognomy. These results demonstrate that secondary vegetation does not appear to negatively impact large mammals in the study area and suggest that, given a favorable context, Cerrado mammals can recolonize and use secondary savannas that regenerated from clearcut. However, our study area should be considered a best-case scenario, as it retained key ecological attributes of high-value secondary habitats. Our simulations showed that a sampling design with 60 camera trap sites surveyed during nine occasions is appropriate to monitor most globally threatened species in the study area, and could be a useful starting point for new monitoring initiatives in other Cerrado areas. © 2017 The Association for Tropical Biology and Conservation

AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential of the seed bank transposition for ecological restoration of the Seasonal Forest in Santa Maria, Rio Grande do Sul. We evaluated the seed bank of the center (BSI) and the seed bank of the edge (BSII) of a forest fragment. The soil was deposited in 1 m2 plots in a completely randomized design with three treatments (BSI, BSII and control) and six replications, in two soil types, Argisol Bruno-Greying (PBAC) and Ultisol (PV). We evaluated floristic composition, seedling emergence, density and mortality in each treatment and soil for twelve months. We carried out ANOVA with repeated measures from twelve months to compare treatments in relation to emergency, density, mortality and species richness. There was a significant difference between treatments for richness and density. The number of species has been increasing over the twelve months. The density was influenced by the winter period and degree of soil hydromorphy. Transposition of the seed bank enabled the inclusion of the tree lifeform and demonstrate to be efficient presenting increase diversity in the deposition sites.

AB  - Generally, palaeoenvironmental interpretations consider only allogenic processes, when autogenic factors may have a strong influence on proxies of stratigraphic sequences. For instance, the Holocene history of the vegetation along the southern littoral of the State of Bahia in north-eastern Brazil is characterized by mangrove dynamics controlled by allogenic processes. However, over smaller timescales (~700 years), autogenic processes may have controlled vegetation dynamics and hence observed pollen distribution. This work proposes tidal channel dynamics as one of the main cause for changes in pollen assemblage along the studied stratigraphic profiles during the last centuries, based on sedimentology, pollen and elemental analysis (δ13C, δ15N and C/N) and radiocarbon dating of sedimentary organic matter from two cores sampled from an abandoned meander and a tidal flat at the mouth of the Jucuruçu River. One core was sampled from a mangrove formed during the past ~550 cal yr bp. Another core recorded sediments in a várzea forest (swamp seasonally and permanently inundated by freshwater) located ~2.7 km from the current shoreline, which displayed a maximum age of ~680 cal yr bp. Two facies associations were identified: tidal channel (A) and tidal flat/oxbow lake (B). This work proposes allogenic processes as the main driving forces controlling the wetlands dynamics at the studied site during the Holocene. However, our data also reveal that part of the changes in vegetation over the last ~700 years reflect tidal channels and tidal flats development, which represent autogenic processes. The change in timescale analysis from the Holocene to recent centuries may have weakened the influence of allogenic factors. However, this needs interpretation with reference to the spatial scale of the depositional environment as the larger the depositional system analyzed, the stronger the influence of autogenic processes on stratigraphic sequences over longer timescales.

AB  - This manuscript presents a survey of the species of Olyreae in the Santa Catarina Island, located at the Atlantic Rainforest biome, at the coast of the Santa Catarina state, southern Brazil. The tribe Olyreae comprehends herbaceous bamboos, which are distributed along tropical and subtropical forests, especially in the Neotropics. This tribe is characterized by the presence of unisexual spikelets, usually dimorphic, and 1-flowered with no rachilla extension and epidermal silica cells usually with cross-shaped silica bodies in the coastal zone and crenate in the intercostal zone. Botanical collections were carried out between May 2011 and March 2013. In addition, morphologic analysis of the vegetative and reproductive structures and microphotographs of the female anthecia of herbarium collections were conducted. Three genera and five species were recognized in the study area, all pertaining to the subtribe Olyrinae: Olyra glaberrima, O. humilis, O. latifolia, Parodiolyra micrantha and Reitzia smithii. Most species is only present in small populations in preserved areas or in areas of natural regeneration. Parodiolyra micrantha is the most common and widely distributed species on the Island, while Reitzia smithii is the species with more restricted distribution, collected again after 34 years in the state of Santa Catarina. Descriptions, illustrations, identification key and comments for each species are provided.

AB  - Evidence of environmental impact on the Cerrado is characterised by the presence of large homogeneous pastures and agricultural areas, with the presence of very fragmented and scattered forest fragments. When these areas are abandoned due to low productivity, natural regeneration begins, which is influenced by environmental factors. The goal of the present study was to evaluate the forest cover temporal dynamics in anthropogenic areas and the influence of climate on natural regeneration in the Cerrado. The study site was an anthropogenic area that has been protected against the entrance of domestic animals and agriculture since 2002. Environments were identified, and natural regeneration dynamics were analysed by the use of vegetation indices calculated from satellite images. Statistical analysis Non-parametric Mann-Kendall was used to check the trend of the rain and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, multivariate analysis to verify the correlations and groups between the years of occurrence of El Niño and La Niña and the values of Normalized Difference Index. Natural regeneration in the Cerrado increased over time and was positively correlated with rainfall incidence. The process of recovery of degraded areas by natural regeneration technique proved efficient in the Cerrado, however, natural regeneration is negatively influenced by the weather phenomenon El Niño. © 2017, Universidade Federal de Uberlandia.

AB  - Artificial perches have been considered an effective way to increase the influx of zoochoric seeds on degraded areas. A main barrier to seedling recruitment beneath perches is competition with other plants, including non-native or invasive species. We therefore believed that the seedling recruitment would increase with invasive species management through solarization. We assessed the use of artificial perches combined with solarization as a management technique for forest restoration. An outline of subdivided plots was installed in an abandoned pasture originally covered by subtropical Atlantic forest in southern Brazil. The invasive species were Nutgrass (Cyperus rotundus - Cyperaceae) and African Liverseed Grass (Urochloa arrecta - Poaceae). Solarization was achieved using a black polyethylene cover. Artificial perches were installed after solarization was complete. Seed rain and established plant community species were assessed. Solarization initially eliminated previously existing vegetation, but the effects were not long lasting. Invasive species grew aggressively by vegetative means from the borders of solarized areas. Artificial perches increased the influx of zoochoric seeds, but the seeds were unable to germinate and establish due to competition by the fast growing invasive species. The combined use of artificial perches and solarization for forest restoration seems to have limited effectiveness. © 2016, Mongaby.com e-journal. All rights reserved.

AB  - Abandoned pastureland provides a prime opportunity for forest recovery of these degraded areas in the Amazon. Many factors impact forest regeneration, including time and intensity of pasture use before abandonment, and proximity of a source of propagules. Given these conditions, it is necessary to better investigate the effect of such factors on the natural regeneration of abandoned pastureland. Here we employed chronosequences to study secondary forest succession in abandoned pastures along the Madeira River, Rondônia, Brazil. We installed 314 m2 plots in 36 abandoned pastures previously subjected to long-term use (average of 9 years), but now at different stages of natural regeneration. All tree species stems ≥30 cm in height were identified, and their diameter was measured at ground level. Using a historical series of Landsat satellite images, time of pasture encroachment ("encapoeiramento"), time of pasture use, and time since last use were all calculated. The percentage of forest cover adjacent to each plot was calculated using a circular buffer (120 m radius) overlaid on a land-cover classification. Model selection procedure was used to access the importance of four predictors on natural regeneration variables (species density, basal area, stem density). We sampled 6380 stems belonging to 202 morphospecies grouped into 138 genera and 51 families. The two most important species were Vismia guianensis and Vismia gracilis that together represented 40% of abundance, 70% of frequency, and 101% of IVI (Importance Value Index) of the plants sampled. Most species (164) were recorded in a maximum of four out of 36 plots sampled. Species density increased by ca. five species per year after pasture encroachment. Occurrence of rare species increased with time following encroachment, while relative abundance and basal area of the main pioneer species decreased with the advance of forest succession. Time of pasture encroachment, time of pasture use, and time since last use had significant effect on natural regeneration, whereas cover of surrounding forest had limited influence. Although constrained by long-term use, natural regeneration in abandoned pastures occurred relatively rapidly based on the high occurrence of resprouting pioneer species, which formed secondary sites during the first years of succession. Afterwards, regeneration was incremented by the establishment of a number of late succession species. We conclude that forest restoration of abandoned pastures in the Amazon should use the natural potential of forest regeneration, considering both the speed and intensity of the process. © 2016 Elsevier B.V..

AB  - Natural regeneration provides multiple benefits to nature and human societies, and can play a major role in global and national restoration targets. However, these benefits are context specific and impacted by both biophysical and socioeconomic heterogeneity across landscapes. Here, we investigate the benefits of natural regeneration for climate change mitigation, sediment retention and biodiversity conservation in a spatially explicit way at very high resolution for a region within the global biodiversity hotspot of the Atlantic Forest. We classified current land-use cover in the region and simulated a natural regeneration scenario in abandoned pasturelands, areas where potential conflicts with agricultural production would be minimized and where some early stage regeneration is already occurring. We then modeled changes in biophysical functions for climate change mitigation and sediment retention, and performed an economic valuation of both ecosystem services. We also modeled how land-use changes affect habitat availability for species. We found that natural regeneration can provide significant ecological and social benefits. Economic values of climate change mitigation and sediment retention alone could completely compensate for the opportunity costs of agricultural production over 20 yr. Habitat availability is improved for three species with different dispersal abilities, although by different magnitudes. Improving the understanding of how costs and benefits of natural regeneration are distributed can be useful to design incentive structures that bring farmers’ decision making more in line with societal benefits. This alignment is crucial for natural regeneration to fulfill its potential as a large-scale solution for pressing local and global environmental challenges. © 2016 The Association for Tropical Biology and Conservation

AB  - Studies of genetic diversity in natural populations are important for the definition of conservation strategies, especially in populations reduced by processes of fragmentation and continuous forest extraction. Molecular markers stand out as interesting tools for these studies. The objective of this research was to characterize the diversity and genetic structure of Plathymenia reticulata (Fabaceae), occurring in two fragments of the Montana Semideciduous Forest in the southern of Espírito Santo State, Brazil, using inter-simple sequence repeat (ISSR) molecular markers. DNA samples from 149 individuals were analyzed using 10 ISSR primers, generating 156 fragments, of which 101 were polymorphic (64.74%). The individuals sampled were classified into three units: adult trees (A), a mixture of progenies (B), and young regenerating individuals (C). The number of loci used (N = 101) was greater than that established as optimal number (N = 88), indicating precision in analyses. The genetic diversity index of Nei (H’ = 0.407) and the Shannon index (I = 0.594) were found to have high genetic diversity. Besides, through the diversity parameters evaluated, it was possible to confirm that in the areas of natural regeneration and progeny mix there is genetic diversity equivalent to that found in adults. The analysis of molecular variance indicated that most of the genetic variation is found within the groups (96.53%). Genetic differentiation among adult trees was low (ΦST = 0.03) indicating that high gene flow rates (Nm = 12.70) are counteracting the effects of genetic drift. The data obtained allowed to evaluate the potential of adult trees as matrices for seed collection and to obtain seedlings with confirmed genetic variability. © 2017 The Authors.

AB  - The present work evaluates the effects of the colonization model on the distribution of vegetation, from the beginning to the most recent period (1975 to 2016), in the urban area of the city of Jaru-kRO, by using geotechnologies. For that, images of the satellite Landsat 2, 3, 5 and 8 were used based on geoprocessing techniques to generate spatial information that allowed the delimitation of portions of the terrain with the mapping of land use and occupation. The period between 1975 and 1990 was characterized by intense anthropic activity in the natural landscape due urbanization and agriculture, reducing the distribution of natural vegetation cover by 80.38% and increasing the distribution of water bodies by 0.26%. On the other hand, the period from 2000 to 2016 showed an increase of plant cover by 7.72% due to the natural regeneration of abandoned areas. This was possibly due to of the attempt to modify the environmental trend in the state of Rondônia, aiming to soften the scenario of native forest destruction as a result of the most intense period of this colonization. © 2018, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro.

AB  - This study aimed to evaluate the dynamics of the physical and chemical recovery of the substrates of waste dumps of different ages undergoing natural regeneration, in a calcary mining in Salto de Pirapora - SP, Brazil. Characterization of the vegetation, vegetation and physical and chemical cover of the substrates of the abandoned waste dumps since 1994 and 2013 and the soil of a native forest fragment adjacent to the mining was carried out. Twelve plots of 10x10m were allocated in each environment. It was verified that the soil cover rate with herbaceous, grassy, regenerating and litter of the sterile stacks are similar to the native forest fragment. The same was observed for the physical characterization of soil resistance to penetration, soil moisture content and relative light index. For the chemical characteristics, in all areas sampled there is aluminum deficiency which, consequently, presented low potential acidity and alkaline pH. The CEC of the substrates of the waste dumps presented values similar to the CEC of the native forest fragment, with abundance in some essential nutrients, indicating the possibility of vegetation development in the sterile stacks and the contribution of the natural regeneration to the substrates. Thus, the plant-soil relationship via natural regeneration in the sterile piles contributed to the improvement of the edaphic quality of the substrates over time, being a potential form of recovery in calcary mining. Thereby, the Fabaceae predominated on the waste dumps, especially Leucaena leucocephala, which, despite being an exotic species, is relevant for the current recovery stage of the substrates. © 2018, Federal University of Lavras.

AB  - The Atlantic Forest is reduced to less than 20 % of its original area, but it still protects an important biological heritage. Forest fragmentation makes the environment more susceptible to invasive species occupation. Jackfruit (Artocarpus heterophyllus) was introduced into Brazil in the seventeenth century; and in the second half of the twentieth century, its natural regeneration increased the density of individuals, compromising the recruitment of many native species. This study investigated the impact of A. heterophyllus invasion on the diversity and tree structure component at the edge of an Atlantic Forest fragment, in Rio de Janeiro (Brazil). Two transect-type plots were set up with 10 m x 100 m (1,000 m2), being divided into 10 subplots of 10 m x 10 m, with a total sampling area of 2,000 m2. Trees with a diameter at breast height (DBH) equals to or greater than 5 cm were tagged and DBH and total height measured. The following phytosociological parameters were estimated: Frequency (F), Density (D), Dominance (Do), Importance (IV) and Coverage (CV) Values. In total, 191 tree individuals were sampled. Invasive species made up more than 35% of the entire vegetation structure in the studied environment, ending in first place in terms of Importance Value (IV = 35.62%). Low floristic wealth seems to have favored the A. heterophyllus invasion process in the community, showing the need for an effective control of the species for the native genetic heritage protection. © 2017, Universidade Federal de Uberlandia.

AB  - The stage of natural forest regeneration may influence soil fauna. This study aimed to test the hypothesis that there are differences in the structure and composition of the soil fauna communities between areas undergoing less advanced (LAS) and more advanced (MAS) stages of natural regeneration of Seasonal Semideciduous Forest at Pinheiral, RJ. Soil fauna was sampled using pitfall traps, during dry and rainy seasons. Total abundance, abundance of the saprophagous/predator group, mainly Formicidae, and the relative participation of Orthoptera were higher in MAS, while the relative participation of Acari, Araneae, Coleoptera, Diptera and the herbivorous group were higher in LAS, during both climatic seasons. Some taxonomic groups were restricted to one of the areas. Richness, evenness and diversity tended to present higher values in LAS (dry season). The higher complexity of the soil fauna community was correlated to the higher leaf litter standing stock in LAS.

AB  - The Atlantic forest is one of the most diverse biomes on Earth but human activities are transforming this ecosystem into one of the most endangered. Most remnant old-growth rainforest is embedded within a mosaic of regenerating forest, tree plantations, pastures, and agricultural production. This has left a large percentage of the region’s endemic species threatened with extinction. Butterflies are considered as sensitive indicators of ecological conditions, especially in the Atlantic forest. This community can provide a window into animal response to restoration and how recovering habitats are used by native animal communities. The primary goal of this paper was to determine if butterfly communities respond to measures of structural recovery in naturally regenerating and re-forested pastures, and if this response increases the similarity of recovering butterfly communities relative to those of intact forests. Butterfly communities were sampled using two sampling methodologies, passive bait trapping and timed meander counts. These data sets were combined and correlated to assessment of habitat structure. We found that butterfly communities respond rapidly to structural changes in habitats as forest structure recovers on abandoned and restored pastures. While many species of mature forest inhabiting butterflies use regenerating forests as habitat, our young forests also retained an almost intact community of ruderal pasture inhabiting butterflies as well, indicating that these habitats retain many features of highly disturbed pastures. We suggest that measures of beta-diversity, which can be used to assess convergence in community structure, are far superior to the alpha-diversity measures that are typically used for assessing restoration recovery. © 2017, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.

AB  - The present article evaluates the changes on the vegetation distribution of the 3.83 km2 permanent preservation areas (PPAs) in the urban portion of Jaru city/ RO, which occurred in the period from colonization to the present time (1975 to 2016). For that, images from the Landsat satellites 2, 3, 5 and 8 were used based on geoprocessing techniques to generate spatial information, including field validations, that allowed the mapping of land use and occupation with the delimitation of classes: Urbanization, Anthropized Area and Forest. The data show that in the studied area, in the period of colonization (1975 to 1990), took place intense anthropic activities related to urbanization and agriculture, with a reduction in the distribution of the Forest class by 60.76% in the PPAs, before their delimitations. In the transition period (1990 to 2000), marked by the end of activities of POLONOROESTE and the beginning of PLANAFLORO (both development plans held in Rondônia), had as characteristic the low percentage variations in the indexes of Urbanization (+ 0.18%), Anthropized Area (-0.16%) and Forest (-1.64%). The delimitations of the PPAs by the Brazilian Forest Code of 2012 in the post-colonization period (2000 to 2016), resulted in an increased distribution of the Forest class by 15.86% in the PPAs, related to its natural regeneration. © 2018; Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro. all rights reserved.

AB  - The vegetation may modifies the structure and composition of the community of edaphic arthropods. This study aimed to compare the community of edaphic arthropods in four areas of abandoned pasture (AP1, AP2, AP3, AP4) and four secondary native forest fragments in a successional gradient (FF1, FF2, FF3, FF4), in Itaboraí, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The areas are positioned on the hillside and the sampling was conducted in transects outlined in a toposequence (upper, middle and lower sections), where pitfall traps were installed in the dry season. The organisms were identified in taxonomic groups (class, order and family). Comparing the averages for AP and FF, there was no defined pattern in terms of the response of structural attributes (total abundance, richness, uniformity and diversity). Among the areas of FF, higher values of all of the structural attributes occurred in the intermediate stages of forest succession (FF2, FF3), compared to the initial (FF1) and advanced stages (FF4). On average for the FF, the most favored groups were Archaeognatha, Coleoptera, Entomobryomorpha, Pseudoscorpionida, Psocoptera and Symphypleona. On average for the areas of AP, the most favored groups were Acari, Araneae, Formicidae, Diplopoda and Auchenorrhyncha. Among the areas of FF, Sternorryncha, Symphyla and Thysanura were favored in FF1, while Coleoptera, Psocoptera, Pseudoscorpionida, Entomobryomorpha and Archaeognatha were favored in the other successional stages (FF2, FF3, FF4. � 2017 Federal University of PiauI.

AB  - The role of biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) during secondary forest succession and in tropical pastures has been investigated and debated for several decades. Here we present results of a replicated experimental study in a degraded cattle pasture of eastern Amazonia using mass balance and a 15N tracer in lined soil pit mesocosms with three treatments: (1) plant-free control plots, (2) pasture grass Brachiaria brizantha, and (3) regrowth of early successional secondary forest species. Accumulation of N in grass biomass slightly exceeded estimates of net N mineralization from the plant-free control plots but was within the margin of error, so inputs of BNF may not have been needed. In contrast, the secondary forest vegetation accumulated about 3 times as much biomass N annually as the net N mineralization estimate, suggesting at least some role for BNF. Based on isotopic and mass measurements of N-fixing species, BNF was estimated to contribute at least 27 ± 3% of mean annual plant uptake in the secondary forest regrowth vegetation plots. Although BNF is probably important for recuperation of tropical secondary forests following land use change, the majority of the N taken up by both grasses and secondary forest regrowth arose from mineralization of the stocks of soil N. ©2018.

AB  - The establishment of plant-pollinator interactions is of great importance for the functioning of ecosystems. These interactions can be recorded directly, by focal observation, or indirectly, by the pollen load on the pollinator body. Thus, the evaluation of the specialization and dependence of mutualistic partners, properties that can be assessed through complex networks, depends on the method used for interaction record. The main objective of this study was to compare a floral-visitation network and a pollen-transport network constructed from interactions between plants and bees sampled in 16 plots in early successional areas in the Atlantic Forest, in Antonina, Paraná, southern Brazil. We initially recorded these interactions by focal observation and we sampled the pollen grains on the bees’ body of six bees, and the two networks were restricted to the interactions of these six species. We subdivided the pollen-transport network into a feeding-pollen network, using only the pollen adhered to the bees' corbicules or scopes, and a pollination network, with the pollen present on the bees’ body, except the legs. These networks were compared in relation to the degree (k), the specialization index (d') and species strength (F), through paired t-tests. The pollen-transport network showed a higher number of interactions, higher k, lower d' and a greater number of plant species than the floral visitation network. There was no variation in F. The feeding-and pollination networks presented similar properties. Pollen analysis revealed that bees tend to perform exclusive foraging flights on pollen flowers. The interactions added from the pollen analysis resulted in differences in the metrics evaluated and complemented the record of the interactions observed in the community. Therefore, the associated information of both types of networks can broaden the understanding of the interactions, thus approaching the actual network description. © 2018, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ).

AB  - Questions: Are vegetation recovery trajectories converging or diverging during succession following clear-cutting? Are the trajectories approaching the species composition of surrounding old-growth forests?. Location: Atlantic forest, Vale Natural Reserve, Linhares, southeast Brazil. Methods: A forest management experiment was established in an old-growth forest using 0.5-ha plots arranged in a randomized block design with five replicates. We analysed data collected from two treatments: plots that were clear-cut in 1980 without burning or tree stump removal, and control plots with old-growth forest that was left unmanaged. We analysed species abundance data (DBH ≥ 10 cm) recorded for both treatments between 6 and 33 yr after clear-cutting. We computed mean multidimensional compositional distance of stands of the same successional age, and compared different ages to test whether trajectories during succession were divergent or convergent. Furthermore, we explored successional trajectories using ordination. Results: Regenerating stands were more similar to each other at 6 yr than at 33 yr after clear-cutting. Trajectories of the five recovering stands showed nearly monotonic divergence during succession and gradually approached the composition of surrounding old-growth stands. Furthermore, pioneer and non-pioneer species colonized the stands throughout the successional trajectory. Species recruitment occurred at different times and the species composition changed substantially during the 33 yr after clear-cutting. As expected, species richness increased over time. Our findings suggest that successional trajectories have their own attractors: the surrounding old-growth stands towards which the composition of the regenerating community tends to return. Even so, 33 yr after clear-cutting, regenerating stands had distinctly different communities from surrounding old-growth forest. Conclusions: Secondary succession in the Atlantic forest shows that multiple, divergent trajectories which started with more similar species composition were directly influenced by their surrounding vegetation and gradually increased their similarities to the surrounding old-growth forest. © 2016 International Association for Vegetation Science

AB  - This study aimed at inventorying the natural regeneration of tree species in an Alluvial Araucaria Forest in the “Planalto Sul Catarinense” region, SC, Brazil; evaluating the dissimilarity between its adult and regenerative components; and verifying the natural regeneration floristic sharing among its different fragments. The regenerative component has been sampled and identified within 48 plots and classified according to the following height classes: Class 1, plants with height varying from 15 cm up to 1 m; Class 2, plants with height varying from 1 and 3 m; and Class 3, plants with height higher than 3 m and DBH (diameter at breast height) smaller than 5 cm. The floristic composition of adult individuals in the area and of regenerative individuals from other fragments has been obtained from the database of the Laboratory of Dendrology of CAV/UDESC. The structure of the regeneration was evaluated by phytosociological descriptors. Dissimilarity between the adult and the regenerative components has been determined by Jaccard, Sorensen and Bray-Curtis distances. The regeneration floristic sharing analysis of different areas was conducted by a dendrogram. A total of 818 individuals belonging to 59 species have been sampled, being Allophylus edulis (A.St.-Hil. et al.) Hieron. ex Niederl. the species with the greatest relative importance. Elevated similarity between the regenerative and adult components have been observed (from 0.24 to 0.43), suggesting a low floristic-structural turnover between components. The area under study have shown a greater floristic connection (<40% of dissimilarity) with other spatially close fragments, indicating that altitude and temperature are important ecological factors for its phyto-geographic compartmentalization. © 2017, Sociedade de Investigacoes Florestais.

AB  - A lack of ecological knowledge leads to innovative tools for investigating spatial relationships in natural forests, among which geostatistics stands out as a set of statistical techniques for modeling and mapping. Thus, this paper aims to apply geostatistical analysis to map and correlate the spatial patterns and dynamics of the basal area for successional tree species groups in a Mixed Tropical Forest remnant in the southern part of Brazil. The floristic composition was obtained through continuous inventory conducted in 400 plots, where the basal area was evaluated for total stock and ecological groups: pioneer, early secondary, late secondary and climax. Subsequently, geostatistical analysis was used for modeling the spatial patterns of the basal area, and ordinary kriging interpolation was applied to compose thematic maps. The results show that the forest structure presents spatial dependence and heterogeneous distribution, in which the spatial behavior of successional tree groups is associated with species aggregation patterns. Moreover, spatial dynamics are influenced by basal area increment, in which spatial changes indicate a natural forest in an advanced secondary successional stage, reflecting a favorable conservation status. This shows the importance of Conservation Units policies as preservation strategies and biodiversity sources for forest restoration. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Mimosa scabrella Benth., popularly known as “bracatinga”, is a pioneer and endemic species of Brazil, occurring in Mixed Ombrophilous Forest associated with Brazilian Atlantic Rainforest biomes. It is a fast-growing tree of the Fabaceae family that facilitates the dynamics of ecological succession. SSR development, when there is no genome sequence, is time and labor intensive and there are no molecular markers for M. scabrella. We developed and validated the first microsatellite markers for this tetraploid species, evaluating mother trees and progenies. Using Illumina sequencing, we identified 290 SSR loci and 211 primer pairs. After 31 SSR loci PCR/agarose electrophoresis selection, a subset of 11 primer pairs was synthetized with fluorescence in the forward primer for PCR and capillary electrophoresis validation with leaf DNA of 33 adult and 411 progeny individuals. Polymorphic locus percentage was 36, 4 in 11 loci, 3 chloroplast SSRs, and 1 nuclear SSR. Allele number of polymorphic loci ranged from 2 to 11 alleles considering all sampling. All 11 primer pairs were also tested for cross-species amplification for five FabaceaeMimosoideae species, ranging from 2 loci transferred to Calliandra tweedii Benth. and all 11 loci transferred to Mimosa taimbensis Burkart. The assessed and validated SSR markers for M. scabrella are suitable and useful for analysis and population genetic studies. © 2017 The Authors.

AB  - Matrix population models may generate important information to prevent undesirable outcomes for endangered species. This is the case for Araucaria angustifolia, a Critically Endangered conifer, with little knowledge regarding its life history and trends in development over time. This study sought to investigate life-history trends of an A. angustifolia population in a subtropical forest in Santa Catarina, Brazil. Predictions based on the Lozenge regeneration model were established in order to determine if this model could predict changes in the species’ population dynamics: (1) the established individuals exhibit long persistence and (2) seedling and sapling abundance, as well as population descriptors, should exhibit behaviour that indicates one of the stages prescribed by the model. All A. angustifolia individuals were evaluated within a 5.1 ha plot at the study site over a six-year period. Lefkovitch’s transition model was used and population descriptors were calculated. Both predictions were fulfilled. The population had λ = 0.9977 (0.9864 < λ < 1.0020; CI 95%), indicating a declining stability. The basal area remained stable, whereas tree density tended to decrease, and seedlings and saplings did not promote an increase in λ. These results indicate that the population was in a phase called thinning, defined by the Lozenge model. The results led to three conclusions: recruitment seems insufficient; survival of reproductive individuals is responsible for the longevity of the population; and the predictions did not refute the Lozenge model. According to this model, the population is expected to regenerate in the future. However, the species exhibits declining stability, which aggravates the endangerment situation. © 2016 NISC (Pty) Ltd.

AB  - Canopy species can act changing abundance, survival and spatial distribution of other species below. The present study investigated the potential of four native species from the Atlantic Forest (Bixa arborea Huber, Inga laurina (Sw.) Willd., Joannesia princeps Vell. and Senna multijuga var. verrucosa (Vogel) H.S. Irwin & R.C. Barneby) at two spacings (2 × 2 and 3 × 3 m) in facilitating natural regeneration in areas undergoing forest restoration in southeastern Brazil. Circular plots were established under the canopies of each individual of these species and in open areas. All regenerating tree species were counted and identified. Joannesia princeps and S. multijuga var. verrucosa supported a greater richness of species under their canopy compared to the control area, but did not differ from the other species. The richness of regenerating trees under Bixa arborea and Inga laurina canopy did not differ from the control area. A greater abundance of regenerating trees was found below Inga laurina, Joannesia princeps and S. multijuga var. verrucosa. Trees planted at 2 × 2 m spacing sheltered a greater richness of regenerating tree species than at 3 × 3 m spacing. The species Joannesia princeps and S. multijuga var. verrucosa and the use of 2 × 2 m spacing are therefore recommended for accelerating the natural succession of degraded areas. Knowledge of the best combinations of species and spacing schemes to use to restore Atlantic rain forest is valuable because this design can guide the structuring and composition of regenerated forests. © 2017, Botanical Society of Sao Paulo.

AB  - The Forest and Landscape Restoration movement has emerged as an approach to reconcile biodiversity conservation, ecosystem services provisioning and human well-being in degraded landscapes, but little is known so far about the potential of different reforestation methods to achieve these objectives. Based on this gap, we assessed the ecological outcomes and local livelihood benefits of community-managed agroforests and second growth forests to assist natural regeneration in the coastal Atlantic Forest of Brazil. We investigated and compared agroforests and secondary forests according to their structure and floristic composition in 51 circular plots of 314 m², their role in supporting local livelihoods (45 semi-structured interviews) and the use and cultural importance of plant species (61 interviews). Agroforests and, more remarkably, managed secondary forests (1) re-established a well-developed forest structure, with a higher density of tree-sized individuals and similar basal area compared to nearby old growth forests; (2) were composed by a rich array of native species, including five threatened species, but had lower species richness than old growth remnants; and (3) improved local livelihoods by supplying market valuable and culturally important plants, including 231 native ethnospecies. Overall, local production systems showed remarkable potential to engage smallholders of developing tropical countries in Forest and Landscape Restoration and contribute to achieve its overall goals. We advocate the promotion of these systems as effective Forest and Landscape Restoration approaches in multi-scale programs and policies. © 2016 The Association for Tropical Biology and Conservation

AB  - Recently included on the UNESCO World Heritage list, the urban forests of Rio de Janeiro are one of the most thorough expressions of the more-than-human character of the so-called ‘cultural landscapes’. Far from pristine nature, Rio’s forests are plant communities that developed on land previously used for agriculture, energy and water supply, and human habitation, among other purposes. Traces of such activities can still be seen in every corner of these forests, currently protected areas. Some of the human marks are very conspicuous and can be noticed by anyone: water tanks, stairways, arches, banana plantations, and the like. But some other traces are so organically integrated in the landscape that only a trained eye can discern them; for example, whole sections of forest dominated by jackfruit, an Asian species, and small plateaus carved into the hillside with a strangely blackened soil. In this article, we investigate the origins of these two kinds of landscape features. Based on primary written sources and iconography, in addition to the relevant historiography, this work of historical reconstruction reveals an inextricable interpenetration between socio-economic and cultural processes — such as cash crop expansion and urban sprawl — on the one hand and bio-ecological processes — such as secondary succession and ecosystem invasion — on the other. In fact, as we argue, both are part of the same moving life-world, a continuous web of more-than-human relationships that generates both city and forest. This socionatural dialectic is responsible for Rio de Janeiro currently being a city full of forests which, if carefully inspected, reveal themselves full of urban history. © 2016 Society for Landscape Studies.

AB  - From the perception of human populations, we can assess the changes occurring in certain landscapes and the factors that cause those changes. Such studies have proven helpful in increasing the knowledge of the history of a landscape, recognizing past formations and projecting its future. Our research objective was to determine how a landscape dominated by the palm tree Attalea speciosa, a species of ecological, economic, and cultural importance, has been changing over time by synthesizing and comparing historical documents and local perceptions. This study was conducted in Araripe Environmental Protection Area, Northeast Region, Brazil. To understand local landscape change, we interviewed active harvesters in four communities in which A. speciosa use has been documented. Historical documents were evaluated as a complement to the interview data. According to local informants, areas previously used for cultivation and animal husbandry that were abandoned or decimated by droughts in the region may have fostered the expansion of a monodominant A. speciosa forest. Furthermore, other forms of landscape management resulting from human population growth may also have affected the current and past distribution of this forest. © 2016, Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.

AB  - Positive interactions in plant communities are under-reported in subtropical systems most likely because they are not identified as stressful environments. However, environmental factors or disturbance can limit plant growth in any system and lead to stressful conditions. For instance, salinity and low nutrient and water availability generate a gradient of stressful conditions in coastal systems depending on distance to shore. In a tropical coastal system in SE Brazil, we aimed to assess whether Guapira opposita, a shrub common in restinga environments, acted as nurse involved in ecological succession and which factors influenced its facilitation process. We sampled perennial species above 10 cm in height under the canopy of 35 G. opposita individuals and in neighbouring open areas. Shrub height, canopy area and distance to freshwater bodies were measured in the field, and distance to the ocean was obtained from aerial images. In addition, we measured the distance to the closest forest patch as a potential source of seeds. Plant abundance and species richness were higher under the canopy of G. opposita than in open areas. Facilitation by G. opposita was mainly determined by shrub height, which had a positive relationship with woody and bromeliads abundance and species richness while there was no relationship with the other factors. Overall, our data evidence that tropical environments may be highly stressful for plants and that nurse species play a key role in the regeneration of restinga environments, where their presence is critical to maintain ecosystem diversity and function. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - The brushwood is a technique of environmental complexation, which consists in the use of plant residues. This technique, when well established technically, can exert influence on seedbed quality, fostering native plant establishment and ecosystem restoration. In this way, we aimed to evaluate the efficiency of brushwood for the induction of natural regeneration of native species in an area covered by exotic inhibitory grasses of the genus Urochloa, as well as check the minimum size required to prevent the re-invasion of the forage. As a hypothesis, we adopted the minimum width of 4 m as sufficient for the establishment of natural regeneration prior to the reoccupation of grasses. The experiment was conducted between May 2014 and May 2016 in Morretes-PR in a lowland evergreen rain forest area. Seven different sizes of brushwood were compared: 6 × 1, 6 × 2, 6 × 3, 6 × 4, 6 × 5, 6 × 6 m and control treatment. Woody species were identified and counted and herbaceous cover percentage estimated after 4, 8, 12, 18 and 24 months. There was no resumption of natural succession of native species. At any size, brushwood alone was ineffective to prevent the growth by grasses from the edges of the plots, and, since it constitutes a residue pile, it further complicates the establishment of woody species. For the creation of safe sites and consequent restoration by natural regeneration, there is a need for local elimination of Urochloa forages, without which native species are unlikely to survive. © 2017, Federal University of Lavras.

AB  - Amazonia is crucial to global carbon cycle. Deforestation continues to be one of the main causes of the release of C into the atmosphere, but forest restoration plantations can reverse this scenario. However, there is still diffuse information about the C and nutrient stocks in the vegetation biomass. We investigated the carbon and nutrient stocks of Fabaceae trees (Inga edulis, Schizolobium amazonicum and Dipteryx odorata) subjected to fertilization treatments (T1 - no fertilization; T2 - chemical; T3 - organic; and T4 - organic and chemical fertilization) in a degraded area of the Balbina Hydroelectric Dam, AM - Brazil. As an early successional species, I. edulis stocked more C and nutrients than the other two species independent of the fertilization treatment, and S. amazonicum stocked more C than D. odorata under T1 and T4. The mixed species plantation had the potential to stock 4.1 Mg C ha-1 year-1, while I. edulis alone could stock 9.4 Mg C ha-1 year-1. Mixing species that rapidly assimilate C and are of significant ecological and commercial value (e.g., Fabaceae trees) represents a good way to restore degraded areas. Our results suggest that the tested species be used for forest restoration in Amazonia. © 2017, Academia Brasileira de Ciencias. All rights reserved.

AB  - Understanding the phytosociology and conditioning ecological factors of the vegetation can subsidize interventions in forests. We analyzed the arboreal stratum and natural regeneration, as well as the influence of environmental variables on species distribution in a seasonal forest in central Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. Thirty-three plots were systematically installed for the arboreal stratum sampling. In each plot, the natural regeneration Class I and Class II were measured. The main species were Trichilia elegans and Cupania vernalis in natural regeneration and Trichilia clausseni and Nectandra megapotamica in arboreal stratum. Relief, soil, and canopy influenced the arboreal stratum and natural regeneration of species. In general, the regenerating stage of the species was conditioned by distinct variables from those related to the adult stage. However, there were cases where only one variable influenced both the adult and the regenerating stages, such as the relationship between soil organic matter content and Trichilia elegans.

AB  - The limitation of knowledge about auto-ecology of Ocotea odorifera (Lauraceae) in the preserved remnants indicates the need for further research to provide subsidies for the implementation of conservation programs. In this context, the present study aimed to evaluate the natural regeneration of Ocotea odorifera (Lauraceae), an endangered species, characteristic of the vegetation type of Araucaria Forest (FOM) occurring in Private Natural Heritage Reserve (PRNP) Uru, Municipality of Lapa, Paraná state, Brazil. The national distribution of this species was lifted from museum collections of the available online data, and in the Curitiba Botanical Museum (MBM). To analyze the natural regeneration were set 10 circular plots of 40 m in diameter, containing an array of seeds in the center, totaling 12,560 m² sampling area. All regenerating individuals Ocotea odorifera contained in the plots were geo-referenced and measured their height and Diameter at Ground Height (DGH). It was also measured the thickness of litter and light intensity in each plot. Analyses were based on phytosociological parameters and the degree of species dispersion was assessed by Morisita Index (Id). The museum survey found 867 records Ocotea odorifera, compiled by 47 national collections, occurring in 16 Brazilian states. The density of natural regeneration was 77.6 ind.ha-1 and the growth pattern of population-inverted J, with greater abundance of individuals (44.71%) with heights up to 0.50 m. The presence of seed trees in the PRNP Uru was limited to areas of FOM at an advanced stage of succession, and the sampling units with thicker litter were those with the highest number of measured individuals. The recognition of ecological potential, especially as the regenerative capacity and the factors influencing it in a natural environment, act as a basis for conservation actions to ensure the perpetuation of Ocotea odorifera. © 2017 Ciência Florestal, Santa Maria, All right reserved.

AB  - Bamboo grove may cause changes in the structure and floristic composition of natural regeneration. This study evaluated the impact caused by Bambusa tuldoides Munro at natural regeneration, in riparian forest in Rio Grande do Sul, south of Brazil. Two areas were evaluated: riparian forest without bamboos (SB) as the reference area, and riparian forest dominated by Bambusa tuldoides (CB). In 2014, ten plots (10×10 m) were installed in each area. All individuals belonging to classes I (30≤ H <130 cm) and II (CBH≤5 cm) were measured and identified. Floristic composition, phytosociological indexes, Shannon diversity index, Margalef richness, Simpson dominance, Sorensen similarity, and cluster analysis by Twinspan were evaluated. Richness and absolute density decreased in CB compared to SB. The areas presented low floristic similarity, and high dominance of one or more species in both classes. Myrtaceae was the predominant botanic family in SB, especially Campomanesia xanthocarpa. In CB most species were secondary, as Myrsine umbellata, Cupania vernalis, and Ocotea puberula. Due to the large differences between SB and CB, the groups formed were restricted mostly to the species of each area. Species such as Myrsine umbellata (class I and II) and Strichnos brasiliensis (class II) appear as indicators and former of groups in CB. We concluded that high density of Bambusa tuldoides affect the richness and diversity of regeneration natural, changing the establishment and perpetuation of the species. Secondary species show greater potential for adaptation to these environments and can act as key species in management and recovery actions. © 2017, Federal University of Lavras. All rights reserved.

AB  - In order to assess the effects of logging under the decomposition subsystem in Tableland Atlantic Forest hotspot we studied the humus-forms in a protected nuclear area (SOO) and in two fragments (PN and BIO) as a model of current remnants at the landscape level. Organic matter stocks were lower in SOO than in fragments where organic matter accumulated in the A horizon. Litter quality is markedly different across sites, with lower calcium and phosphorous proportions for fragments, as well as for hemorganic horizons, where minor values of Ca2+, exchangeable bases, pH and base saturation were also registered for fragments. Two humus forms were classified: a tropical mesotrophic mull in SOO Reserve and a tropical oligotrophic mull in fragments. Organic matter accumulation in fragments is likely to be related to poorer nutrient status and to higher Al3+ linking to less biodegrading organic compounds. These results suggest lower calcium recycling and a slow organic matter turnover into logging fragments compared to the protected Reserve. Finally, our results show that for the humus forms analyzed, there is a relationship between litter quality and soil characteristics, which leads to another way of functioning of the decomposition subsystem, characteristic of a secondary successional stage in the fragments. © 2017, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ).

AB  - Tree structure and diversity of a secondary Atlantic Forest resulting from the abandonment (ca. 70 years) of a shaded coffee (Coffea arabica) plantation was studied in southeastern Brazil. All trees with DBH ≥ 5 cm (alive and dead) were measured in 25 plots of 20 × 20 m. Out of the 1926 sampled trees, 1837 were living trees belonging to 116 species. The most important species (importance value IV) in the community were Euterpe edulis (22.9% present in all plots) and Piptadenia gonoacantha (16.5%). Euterpe edulis is a typical palm tree of high importance value in mature forests, comprising 41.2% of individuals. The results show a more mature tree community in relation to other secondary forests with the same abandonment period in the region, with high richness and diversity of species, high basal area, and low dead tree density. In addition, several endangered species were recorded with high conservation value for the regional flora. The results also showed many typical characteristics of “novel ecosystems” discussed here in order to value these environments, still neglected due to strong environmental human alterations. ©, 2017 SISEF.

AB  - In tropical forest, landscape fragmentation and the consequent degradation of disturbed forests increase the incidence of light and dry hot winds, causing a disturbance on natural regeneration. Under these conditions, lianas (woody vines) development is stimulated instead of other species, which are more suited to mature forest and under less influence of the edge effect. For this, lianas colonization is an important variable for assessing the disturbance level of a forest. In this context, it becomes important to understand the nature of the competitive relationships between hyper-abundant lianas and ring growth of the host trees. Here, we selected trees with occupation or absence of lianas from two tropical species – Pinus caribaea var. hondurensis (Caribbean pine) and Tectona grandis (teak) – localized in a semideciduous forest fragment in southeastern Brazil, aiming to compare growth, climatic response, anatomy (vessels and intra-annual density fluctuations), wood density and carbon, by tree-ring analysis. The results showed that the lianas caused a change in tree-ring anatomy of host trees in last 10 years, mainly. We observed that trees occupied by lianas had a decrease the radial growth and carbon in the two species, an increase of the vessels size in teak and a decrease of the IADF frequency in Caribbean pine. In teak, the climate-tree relationship indicated that trees with lianas had lower response to rainfall and higher response to temperature in the summer (rainy and hottest period); in Caribbean pine, we observed that trees with lianas had a 2-month delay in the radial growth response to rainfall in the dry season. In the teak group, we observed that host trees had higher wood density values than liana-free tree in the outer rings, and the opposite was showed for pine. These findings show that tree-ring growth of host trees are a strong bioindicator of forest disturbance caused by aggressive colonization of lianas. We believe that these methods are applicable to future studies relating to the effects of habitat fragmentation and forest degradation on biodiversity and ecosystem services, particularly in the context of global climate change. © 2016 Elsevier GmbH

AB  - In order to investigate the response of bees and wasps (Hymenoptera) to environmental restoration, one assemblage of a restoration fragment was compared to six other primary forest fragments in western Paraná, Brazil. Bees and wasps were sampled in five fragments in 2013 and the remainder, including the fragment undergoing restoration, in 2014. The samples were collected by bowl-traps in blue and yellow colors, between 9 am and 3 pm, during February, March and April. The number of traps varied with the perimeter of the areas to ensure a proportional sampling effort. In total, 21 samples were taken, with sampling effort of 126 h. The restoration fragment presented ecological indexes values (H’, D and Dmn) statistically equal to those of the largest sampled forest fragments, but it has different species in relation to other forest fragments. The main species to differentiate the assemblages of the forest and restoration fragments were identified by SIMPER analysis. Generally, the common species of forest fragments showed a significant correlation (rs < 0.05) with area descriptors. However, there was no association between the main species of the restored fragment and the area descriptors (rs > 0.05). The fragment in restoration provides opportunity for a diverse colonization and presents its own composition of bees and wasps, but still different from the six reference fragments and so it is still not considered as restored. © 2017, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ).

AB  - Studies on the natural regeneration of tree species communities are important for providing information on forest development capacity. This research aimed to evaluate the floristic-structural variations of the tree regenerative component along a topographic gradient in an ecotonal area between a Mixed Ombrophilous Forest and a Deciduous Seasonal Forest of Santa Catarina, Brazil. 30 sampling units of which all regenerating tree species individuals have been identified were allocated in the forest fragment. The sampling units were then distributed along a topographic gradient into lower, intermediate and upper sectors. Abundance, richness, Shannon’s diversity index (H’) and Pielou’s evenness index (J) have been determined for both the whole community as for each sector. The community floristic-structural organization was verified by the means of the non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS), the indicator species analysis and the permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA). Abundance differences among sectors were analyzed through the Kruskal-Wallis test with post hoc multiple nonparametric test while richness differences were verified through rarefaction. Regenerating individuals density in the upper sector [129 (21.300 ind.ha-1)] was lower than both in the lower [401 (63.800 ind.ha-1)] and intermediary [241 (36.300 ind.ha-1)] sectors. There was variation in the floristic-structural composition (p < 0.001) among topographic positions; the lower sector was the most distinct one and showed the highest number of indicator species. © 2017, Sociedade de Investigacoes Florestais.

AB  - We aimed to describe the dynamics and structure of woody regenerative tree species in a degraded highland area. Shrub-tree individuals were sampled in 2014, 2015 and 2016. Height distribution histograms were built and recruitment and mortality were determined for the most abundant species. Along time, there were an increment in number of individuals and changes in hypsometric distribution. The five most abundant species, with potential to be used in restoration of degraded lands, showed distinctive dynamics patterns. © 2017.

AB  - The Atlantic Forest biome has only 13 percent of its pristine vegetation cover left. This article analyzes the consequences of land changes on forest cover in the Paraíba Valley, São Paulo state, Brazil, from 1985 to 2011. Multitemporal satellite image classifications were carried out to map eight land use and land cover classes. The forest cover increased from 2,696 km2 in 1985 to 4,704 km2 in 2011, mostly over areas of degraded pastures. The highest rates of afforestation were observed within protected areas around eucalyptus plantations. On the other hand, deforestation processes were concentrated on areas covered by secondary forests. Socioeconomic changes taking place in particular Brazilian settings, such as industrialization and agricultural modernization, allied to the Paraíba Valley's natural biophysical constraints for agricultural production, have led the region to experience a remarkable case of forest transition. © 2017 American Association of Geographers.

AB  - In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that: a) bromeliad Ananas ananassoides individuals and Tachigali vulgaris tree individual have an aggregate distribution pattern, and b) are spatially dissociated. To this effect, we quantified all A. ananassoides and T. vulgaris individuals (DBH of at least 30 cm) in large plot (1 ha) composed by 100 subplots measuring 10×10 m in a savanna woodland in the Bacaba Municipal Park, Nova Xavantina, Mato Grosso. The spatial pattern of A. ananassoides and T. vulgaris, and their spatial relationships, were measured using the aggregation and the association index, respectively. Both species had an aggregate distribution pattern and were spatially dissociated, which corroborates the hypotheses of this study. In this case, the preferred occupation in gaps by both species and the growth of the bromeliad in clumps may be conditioning the populations’ spatial dependence. On the other hand, the bromeliad’s clump formation and the tree species shading may be mutually exclusive factors, which intensify their competition for space and light and reveal spatial incompatibility by these populations. Further studies should be conducted to better understand the interactions between the herbaceous and tree layer, incorporating the temporal dynamics of natural regeneration and habitat conditions. © 2017, Asociacion Argentina de Ecologia.

AB  - Studies of the dynamics in vegetal communities are essential to understand the cerrado ecology's behavior, especially considering its wide geographical distribution and heterogeneity. This kind of study helps to comprehend the mechanisms that maintain the community, generating subsidies for its conservation. This study aimed to analyze the tree community's dynamics over five years in a cerrado sensu stricto swath of 87ha. It wass protected from fire for about 30 years and is located in the municipality of Olhos-d'Água, North of Minas Gerais State, Brazil. The assumed hypothesis was that the period of protection from fire was sufficient for the community to stabilize its dynamics and thus, to compose a mature structure. The data obtained refer to 24 permanent plots of 1.000 m2 (total of 2.4 ha), where all trees with diameter at breast high 1.30 above the soil (DBH) ≥ 5 cm were marked, measured and sampled in the years 2005 and 2010. The changes in the phytosociological structure were analyzed and the mortality and recruitment rates were estimated basing on the density, gain and loss in basal area, stability and turnover times, and the periodic annual increment of the community and populations. This cerrado area presented a dynamic balance, with little variation in floristic composition and phytosociological and the structuring of the woody component had increased relatively. The populations' growth that is sensitive to fire suggests an ecological succession influenced by the absence of fire.

AB  - Spondias tuberosa Arr., a fructiferous tree endemic to the northeast Brazilian tropical dry forest called Caatinga, accounts for numerous benefits for its ecosystem as well as for the dwellers of the Caatinga. The tree serves as feed for pollinators and dispersers as well as fodder for domestic ruminants, and is a source of additional income for local smallholders and their families. Despite its vantages, it is facing several man-made and natural threats, and it is suspected that S. tuberosa could become extinct. Literature review suggests that S. tuberosa suffers a reduced regeneration leading to population decrease. At this juncture S. tuberosa cannot be considered threatened according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List Categories and Criteria, as it has not yet been assessed and hampered generative regeneration is not considered in the IUCN assessment. The combination of threats, however, may have already caused an extinction debt for S. tuberosa. Due to the observed decline in tree density, a thorough assessment of the S. tuberosa population is recommended, as well as a threat assessment throughout the entire Caatinga.

AB  - Understanding the response of species with differing life-history traits to habitat edges and habitat conversion helps predict their likelihood of persistence across changing landscape. In Brazil's Atlantic Forest, we evaluated frog richness and abundance by breeding guild at four distances from the edge of a reserve: i) 200 m inside the forest, ii) 50 m inside the forest, iii) at the forest edge, and iv) 50 m inside three different converted habitats (coffee plantation, non-native Eucalyptus plantation, and abandoned pastures, hereafter matrix types). By sampling a dry and a wet season, we recorded 622 individual frogs representing 29 species, of which three were undescribed. Breeding guild (i.e. bromeliad, leaf-litter, and water-body breeders) was the most important variable explaining frog distributions in relation to edge effects and matrix types. Leaf-litter and bromeliad breeders decreased in richness and abundance from the forest interior toward the matrix habitats. Water-body breeders increased in richness toward the matrix and remained relatively stable in abundance across distances. Number of large trees (i.e. DBH > 15 cm) and bromeliads best explained frog richness and abundance across distances. Twenty species found in the interior of the forest were not found in any matrix habitat. Richness and abundance across breeding guilds were higher in the rainy season but frog distributions were similar across the four distances in the two seasons. Across matrix types, leaf-litter species primarily used Eucalyptus plantations, whereas water-body species primarily used coffee plantations. Bromeliad breeders were not found inside any matrix habitat. Our study highlights the importance of primary forest for bromeliad and leaf-litter breeders. We propose that water-body breeders use edge and matrix habitats to reach breeding habitats along the valleys. Including life-history characteristics, such as breeding guild, can improve predictions of frog distributions in response to edge effect and matrix types, and can guide more effective management and conservation actions. © 2016 Ferreira et al.

AB  - Question: Identifying the factors that lead to the success of restoration projects has been a major challenge in ecological restoration. Here we ask which factors, aside from time since restoration began, drive the recovery of tree biomass, density and richness of the understorey in riparian forests undergoing restoration. Location: Semideciduous Atlantic Forest with tropical climate and deep, fertile soils, southeast Brazil. Methods: We sampled tree basal area (DBH ≥ 5 cm), density and richness of the understorey (DBH < 5 cm) in 26 riparian forests undergoing restoration (a chronosequence spanning 4–53 years). We assessed the following variables as possible factors, besides time, influencing community attributes: (1) planting design: density and richness of seedlings planted; (2) landscape features: proximity index measuring forest cover within a 1.5-km radius, distance and size of the nearest forest remnant; and (3) environmental factors: invasive grasses, soil fertility, drought, average annual precipitation and proportion of fine particles in the soil. We performed correlation analyses including predictor and response variables, followed by stepwise backward regression (AIC), multiple and simple linear regressions, to investigate the relationships between those factors and the community attributes. Results: Tree basal area was primarily influenced by the proportion of small particles in the soil (+) and secondarily by rainfall (−). Understorey richness was influenced by the combination of size (+) and distance (−) of the nearest patch, rainfall (−) and soil fertility (+). Understorey density was primarily influenced by the size of the nearest forest remnant (+) and secondarily by invasive grasses (−). No influence of density or richness of the seedlings planted was observed. Conclusion: Environmental factors and landscape configuration drive the recovery of tree biomass, density and richness in communities undergoing restoration. The most relevant ecological filters influencing restoration success are availability of soil water and nutrients and the distance and size of the nearest remnant of native vegetation. The expected influence of richness and density of seedlings planted, considered for many years as important drivers of forest restoration success, was not confirmed in this study. © 2017 International Association for Vegetation Science

AB  - The Araucaria forests of Southern Brazil have been drastically reduced as a result of anthropic intervention and are currently found at different stages of succession. The objective of our study was to understand the influence of forest fragmentation on the phytosociological composition of its tree component. The composition of floristic groups of the tree component and their correlation with the edaphic and environmental variables in a fragment of the Araucaria Forest in the municipality of Curitibanos, state of Santa Catarina, Brazil was analyzed. A hundred and ten permanent continuous plots (10 m2) with forest edges of different origins and formation times were established for sampling. Trees with diameter ≥ 5 cm at breast height (DBH) were measured and identified. Using TWINSPAN, data were analyzed for species importance values (including indicator species) in the formation of floristic groups. Floristic similarities resulted in separating groups conditioned by the forest succession. The presence of the invasive species Pinus taeda L. and pioneer species at the forest expansion border contributed to the formation of a spatially cohesive group. The other areas did not show influence of edge effects, being in an initial secondary succession stage, dominated by Jacaranda puberula Cham. Low edaphic variation among the classes of lithosols in a flat relief had no influence on the formation of floristic groups. © 2018, Fundacao de Pesquisas Florestais do Parana.; As Florestas de Araucárias encontram-se fragmentadas por diversos impactos antrópicos em ambientes com diferentes estágios de sucessão. Para entender as variações fitossociológicas do componente arbóreo e a influência da fragmentação, um fragmento de Floresta Ombrófila Mista Montana, do município de Curitibanos (SC), foi estudado por meio de análise de grupos florísticos do componente arbóreo e correlação com variáveis edáficas e ambientais. Foram alocadas 110 parcelas permanentes (10 m2) contínuas influenciadas por bordas de diferentes origens e tempos de formação. As árvores com diâmetro ≥ 5 cm para altura do peito (DAP) foram mensuradas e identificadas. Os dados foram analisados pelo valor de importância das espécies e formação de grupos florísticos e suas respectivas espécies indicadoras pelo método TWINSPAN. Os agrupamentos de similaridades florísticas resultaram em grupos condicionados pela sucessão florestal. A presença de espécie invasora Pinus taeda L. e espécies pioneiras na borda da floresta contribuiu para formação de um grupo espacialmente coeso. As demais áreas não sofreram influência das bordas devido a uma sucessão secundária inicial dominada pela espécie Jacaranda puberula Cham.. A presença de relevo plano e a pouca distinção das variáveis edáficas entre as classes de solos litólicos não influenciaram na formação dos grupos florísticos. © 2018, Fundacao de Pesquisas Florestais do Parana.

AB  - Cocoa agroforests like the cabrucas of Brazil's Atlantic forest are among the agro-ecosystems with greatest potential for biodiversity conservation. Despite a global trend for their intensification, cocoa agroforests are also being abandoned for socioeconomic reasons especially on marginal sites, because they are incorporated in public or private protected areas, or are part of mandatory set-asides under Brazilian environmental legislation. However, little is known about phylogenetic structure, the processes of forest regeneration after abandonment and the conservation value of former cabruca sites. Here we compare the vegetation structure and composition of a former cabruca 30–40 years after abandonment with a managed cabruca and mature forest in the Atlantic forest region of Espirito Santo, Brazil. The forest in the abandoned cabruca had recovered a substantial part of its original structure. Abandoned cabruca have a higher density (mean ± CI95 %: 525.0 ± 40.3 stems per ha), basal area (34.0 ± 6.5 m2 per ha) and species richness (148 ± 11.5 species) than managed cabruca (96.0 ± 17.7; 24.15 ± 3.9 and 114.5 ± 16.0, respectively) but no significant differences to mature forest in density (581.0 ± 42.2), basal area (29.9.0 ± 3.3) and species richness (162.6 ± 15.5 species). Thinning (understory removal) changes phylogenetic structure from evenness in mature forest to clustering in managed cabruca, but after 30–40 years abandoned cabruca had a random phylogenetic structure, probably due to a balance between biotic and abiotic filters at this age. We conclude that abandoned cocoa agroforests present highly favorable conditions for the regeneration of Atlantic forest and could contribute to the formation of an interconnected network of forest habitat in this biodiversity hotspot. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - Anthropogenic activities have accelerated habitat change, loss, and fragmentation, threatening biodiversity over large portions of the tropics. The resulting anthropogenically created landscape mosaics often include forests of different successional stages or that have experienced different levels of anthropogenic use, which affect the physical structure of the forest (e.g., forest height, vertical complexity of vegetation). These physical characteristics of forests may affect the abundance and biodiversity of forest inhabitants, and obscure effects of landscape changes (e.g., percent forest cover) on animal species. Because bats are ecologically diverse and include seed dispersers, pollinators, and top predators, they contribute to the structure and function of forests, and directly affect forest integrity and regeneration. Thus, understanding how variation in the vegetative structure of forests affects the abundance and biodiversity of bats may provide important information to effectively manage and conserve forest fragments. We surveyed bats at 24 sites in the southern Brazilian Amazon, and quantified vegetation structure (density, height, and basal area of trees, density of understory, and canopy openness). Using generalized linear mixed-effects models, we tested simple relationships of each structural characteristic with community- (taxonomic and phylogenetic dimensions of biodiversity), guild-, and population-level attributes of bats. Models for total abundance, taxonomic biodiversity (species diversity and dominance), and phylogenetic diversity were significant, increasing with tree height and basal area, and decreasing with canopy openness. At the population level, abundances of frugivores (Carollia perspicillata, Rhinophylla pumilio, Artibeus planirostris, A. obscurus, A. lituratus, Uroderma bilobatum) and nectarivores (Lonchopylla thomasi, Glossophaga soricina) were related significantly to vegetation structure. Abundances of some understory frugivores exhibited negative relationships with tree height, choosing younger forests, whereas abundances of canopy frugivores were highest in closed canopy forests. Of the nectarivores, L. thomasi was more abundant in older forests (negative relationship with density of trees), whereas G. soricina was more abundant in areas with low canopies and low basal area (i.e., earlier successional forest). Consequently, effective management of forest fragments should include consideration of local forest age and vegetation structure, as well as forest connectivity and patch size. In general, protecting areas with large trees and closed canopies enhances the persistence of pollinators and seed dispersers. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In the southern part of the Atlantic Forest region, in Santa Catarina, Brazil, coal mining has led to severe degradation, with former mining areas abandoned decades ago without any concern about environmental and social damage. Up to recently, little restoration activity had been developed, despite severe and ongoing environmental degradation that also causes risks to human health. We argue that these areas should be made restoration priority, and that the development of specific restoration actions and measures for sites like these are urgent. To achieve effective restoration planning we must overcome some challenges, such as prioritization of areas for restoration, establishment long-term monitoring, development of realistic goals, avoidance of the use of invasive grasses, and inclusion of human population and their needs into discussion of restoration goals and approached. We recognize that, due to pollution and contamination problems, cost for restoration is a massive challenge in the region, but even higher costs for population and environment are expected if sites would not be restored. Considering the environment and human health risks of areas degraded by coal mining, restoration efforts should be of high priority on all level of governance, and ways should be found to include this into the procedures for prioritization of restoration activities. © 2017 Associação Brasileira de Ciência Ecológica e Conservação

AB  - We aimed to monitor an area under restauration, in the municipality of Pouso Redondo, Southern Brazil. The floristic-structural composition of adults and juveniles components was analyzed by NMDS, by phytosociological estimative and by adult diametric distribution. Both components demonstrated segregation in NMDS, Baccharis semiserrata DC. showed the highest importance value, Casearia sylvestris Sw. presented the highest index of natural regeneration and the adult diametric distribution showed a "j inverted" pattern. We concluded that the study area is found under an ecological succession process and that there are no impeditive factors for the establishment of juveniles individuals, suggesting an elevated resilience. © 2017.

AB  - In Brazil, a high number of woody species have been used for forest restoration plantings. However, this action is widely questionable due to the no re-establishment of a considered “normal” successional trajectory. In this study, we analyzed subtropical rainforest natural regeneration at abandoned pastures and we showed that vegetation is characterized, predominantly, by few high dominant native woody species, highlighting especially Vernonanthura discolor (Asteraceae), Myrsine coriacea (Primulaceae), and Piptocarpha regnellii (Asteraceae). Our results also indicate that these high dominance species favor the lowest diversity of natural regeneration. In this regard, we suggest implementing actions that provide improvements and facilitate natural processes of ecological succession by planting dominant native woody species. This takes into consideration the re-establishment of a considered “normal” successional trajectory. © 2017, ALÖKI Kft.

AB  - Summary: Understanding how land-use intensification affects forest resilience is a key for elucidating the mechanisms underlying regeneration processes and for planning more sustainable land-use systems. Here, we evaluate how the intensification of a swidden cultivation system affects secondary-forest resilience in the Amazon. Along a gradient of land-use intensity, we analysed the relative role of management intensity, soil properties and landscape configuration in determining the resilience of early secondary forests (SFs). We assessed resilience as the recovery level of forest structure and species diversity achieved by SFs 5 years after abandonment. We used as a reference the recovery level achieved by SFs subjected to the lowest intensity of use, given that these SFs are part of a dynamic system and may not develop to old-growth forests. Therefore, we interpreted a deviation from this reference level as a change in forest resilience. The recovery of forest structure was determined by management intensity, while the recovery of species diversity was driven by landscape configuration. With increasing number of cycles and weeding frequency along with decreasing fallow period and patch area, SF basal area and canopy height decreased, regeneration shifted from a seed- to sprout-dependent strategy, and liana infestation on trees increased. With decreasing area covered by old-growth forest, species richness and Shannon diversity decreased. Secondary-forest resilience decreased with land-use intensification, mainly mediated by the effect of management intensity upon regeneration strategies. Our findings demonstrate the - many times overlooked - importance of previous management intensity in determining the structure of SFs and highlight the importance of regeneration strategy for forest resilience. Synthesis. Swidden cultivation supports people's livelihoods and transforms landscapes in the tropics. The sustainability of this system depends on ecosystem services provided by SFs that develop during the fallow period. Land-use intensification reduces the resilience of SFs and ultimately may drive the system towards an arrested succession state that holds a lower potential to deliver ecosystem services to the Amazonian people. Under an intensification scenario, the adaptation of management practices is needed to guarantee the resilience of swidden cultivation systems. Swidden cultivation supports people's livelihoods and transforms landscapes in the tropics. We evaluated how the intensification of this system affects secondary-forest resilience in the Amazon. Secondary-forest resilience decreased with land-use intensification, mainly mediated by the effect of management intensity upon regeneration strategies.

AB  - To enlarge the knowledge of an Atlantic rainforest in Santa Catarina State, a floristic and phytosociological study of the tree component was carried out. In this study, the quadrant-point method (250 points) was used, including all the individuals with minimum DBH (diameter at breast height) of 5 cm. The floristic composition resulted in a total richness of 102 species. The tree total density was 2,034 individuals.ha-1. The families with the highest number of species were Myrtaceae, Lauraceae, Fabaceae, and Annonaceae, and among species with highest importance value are Euterpe edulis Mart. and Ficus adathodifolia Schott ex Spreng. The tree species classification in ecological groups showed a slight predominance of the late secondary species (56%) over species of early succession, indicating that the vegetation is in the advanced stage of ecological succession. Zoochory was the most frequently observed syndrome (77%), followed by anemochory (15%). The results will contribute to further studies on remnant of Atlantic Rainforest in Santa Catarina State dynamic and to environmental management, preservation and recovery programs. © 2015, Sociedade de Investigacoes Florestais.

AB  - Changes in physiognomy, species composition and structure, and dispersal mechanisms of canopy and subcanopy plant assemblages were investigated along a chronosequence of three ages: 12, 20, and 50+ years old (=old-growth), three replications in each, in an Atlantic Forest landscape in Northeastern Brazil. Our objective was to investigate whether there is floristic and structural convergence along secondary succession. There were significant differences between secondary and old-growth forests in density and basal area only for the subcanopy. Differences in density between forest ages were noted when the assemblage was analyzed per diameter and height classes. Richness of canopy species of both secondary ages differed from those of old-growth forests. Some dominant species in the canopy of secondary forests showed a significant decrease in density with increasing age, which indicates an ongoing process of floristic changes. The low level of shared species between secondary and old-growth forests supports the idea that species composition is one of the last components to recover during successional process. Zoochory was the most important dispersal guild in species percentage and number, irrespective of stand age. Although regenerating areas can take alternative pathways, our results indicate that secondary Atlantic Forest sites have a high potential for natural regeneration. This recovery is recorded as a physiognomic convergence of the canopy layer in as little as 12 years, and progressive introductions of later successional species into the plant assemblage that lead to convergence in terms of the diversity and richness of the subcanopy and of dispersal guilds just 20 years after abandonment. © 2014, The Japanese Forest Society and Springer Japan.

AB  - The present research aimed to analyze and describe patterns of spatial interactions of natural regeneration of Ocotea odorifera (Vell.) Rohwer (Brazilian sassafras) in a Mixed Ombrophyllous Forest (Araucaria Forest) located in the Irati National Forest, Southern Brazil. The hypothesis in this paper is that there is no evidence in spatial associations about the occurrence of interactions among individuals of these species. We sampled three plots of one hectare each, collecting height, diameter and location data for all Brazilian sassafras individuals with total height ≥ 30 cm. Bivariate analyzes using K12-function of Ripley were performed to describe the spatial interactions of individuals of this species between different sizes. Thus, we expected that the pattern of spatial interaction presented by the trees in two-dimensional space indicate attraction or repulsion between categories. In plants, individuals of the same species have the same needs and tend to compete to obtain resources. However, the theory also supports positive interactions, or facilitation. We discuss some inferences about the phenomena that should be related to the spatial interaction patterns presented by Ocotea odorifera. We rejected the initial hypothesis, since O. odorifera presented negative interactions of adults with seedlings over short distances and positive interactions between the seedlings.

AB  - This study explores the possibility of estimating different stages of ecological succession in tropical dry forests using CHRIS/PROBA hyperspectral and multi-angular satellite images. Tropical dry forests (TDFs) in the Americas are considered one of the most threatened ecosystems in region, experiencing also high rates of secondary growth. In this study, TDFs are studied along three successional stages (early, intermediate and late) in sites across a latitudinal gradient in the Americas. Sites are located in Mexico, Nicaragua and Brazil. Due to their strong annual phenological signal, reflectance values of CHRIS/PROBA Mode-4 were extracted for the dry and wet season, and afterwards analyzed using scatterplots, n-D visualization tools, and Transformed Divergence separability tests. Spectral separation of three successional stages within TDFs was observed in images corresponding to the dry season, at all study sites. In this season, it is possible to discriminate the different successional stages in all viewing angles. For the spectral separation of the three successional stages in images of the wet season, it is required the use of the 18 bands of the sensor. Our analysis also indicates that better spectral separation is achieved at ±. 55°, in both seasons. Our results confirm the utility of multi-angular and hyperspectral sensors as a critical tool for environmental planning in TDFs environments. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - In this paper we analyze and compare natural regeneration in shrub-tree community in three areas below Pinus caribaea stands and a natural area (cerrado sensu stricto). We also analyze the influence of biophysical and environmental variables on the distribution of regenerating shrub-tree species. The areas were analyzed and compared in relation to dispersal syndromes as well, being zoochory and anemochory the prevailing syndroms in the four areas. The sites below P. caribaea show a heterogeneous regeneration with the number of species ranging from 18 to 42. We analyzed the influence of the biophysical and environmental variables performing a canonical correspondence analyses, being found significant values for variables distance from remnant and basal area. The species Siparuna guianensis, Miconia albicans, Xylopia aromatica, Sclerolobium paniculatum, Casearia sylvestris and P. caribaea were the most importante ones in the four areas. © 2015, Northeast Forestry University and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Remote sensing studies of vegetation cover and hydrologic dynamics in Amazonian wetlands have been mostly limited temporally or spatially, and the distribution and spatial configuration of Amazonian várzea habitats remains poorly known. This study uses multitemporal PALSAR L-band radar imagery combined with object-based image analysis, data mining techniques and field data to derive vegetation structure and inundation patterns and characterize major vegetation types in várzea forests of the Mamirauá Sustainable Development Reserve. Our results show that the combination of vegetation cover and inundation extent information can be a good indicator of the complex gradient of habitats along the floodplain. The intersection between vegetation and flood duration classes showed a wider range of combinations than suggested from field based studies. Chavascal areas—chacaracterized as a dense and species-poor shrub/tree community developing in old depressions, abandoned channels, and shallow lakes—had shorter inundation periods than the usually recognized hydroperiod of 180–240 days of flooding, while low várzea—a diverse community that have fewest and smallest species, and highest individual density and that tolerate 120–180 days of flooding every year—was distributed between flood duration ranges that were higher than reported by the literature. Forest communities growing at sites that were never mapped as flooded could indicate areas that only flood during extreme hydrological events, for short periods of time. Our results emphasize the potential contribution of SAR remote sensing to the monitoring and management of wetland environments, providing not only accurate information on spatial landscape configuration and vegetation distribution, but also important insights on the ecohydrological processes that ultimately determine the distribution of complex floodplain habitat mosaics. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - Many harvested timber species of tropical forests have not been regenerating sufficiently and have thus made post-harvesting silvicultural treatments necessary. This study analysed the profitability of sawnwood produced through four treatments in seedlings and saplings naturally present or planted in logging gaps. The treatments were (1) standard procedures of reduced-impact logging or control, (2) tending of the naturally established regeneration, (3) enrichment planting 1 (EP-1) and (4) enrichment planting 2 (EP-2). In EP-1 seedlings were planted in 2-year-old gaps keeping logging residuals inside the gap while in EP-2 seedlings were planted in 1-year-old gaps with residuals removed. Species of EP-2 had higher financial value and growth rates than species in EP-1. Growth rates of treated individuals were projected in 30 and 60 years to simulate sawnwood production. With increases of 25 and 50% in growth rates, 500% in timber prices, and interest rates of 4 and 6% year-1, tending and enrichment planting could profit at year 60. These silvicultural treatments, with technological improvements, can become even more financially profitable for forest managers and investors. © Forest Research Institute Malaysia.

AB  - The conditions for plant establishment in mature forest are different from those found in disturbed areas. In dry environments, the herbaceous cover is the most important in the recolonization of deforested areas. It can, therefore, act as an ideal biological group for assessing how changes in habitat heterogeneity affect the resilience of dry forests. The aim of this research was to evaluate whether natural regeneration of the herbaceous stratum differed between areas of mature and secondary forest of Caatinga and to describe this process. The study took place in the Brazilian semiarid region during the rainy season 2011 (January to August), where fifty 1m² plots were set up, 25 allocated to the microhabitat established as “between canopies” and 25 to the microhabitat “under the canopy”. The herbaceous species selected for the study were Delilia biflora (Asteraceae), Gomphrena vaga (Amaranthaceae) and Pseudabutilon spicatum (Malvaceae), abundant species occurring in both areas. All individuals from the selected populations were counted, marked with sequential numbers, and the height of the stem was measured. Differences between areas, and in size and survival between microhabitats, were found only for the first two species. Fruit production was higher in the mature forest for the three species. The study concluded that: 1. The effect of the microhabitats “between canopies” and “under the canopy” in mature and secondary forest areas depends on the species considered; 2. Populations sensitive to light intensity differ in number of individuals, height and fruit production; and 3. The resilience of anthropogenic areas in semiarid environments can be characterized by the presence of spatial heterogeneity with regard to the emergence and survival of herbaceous seedlings, suggesting that the regeneration of disturbed areas may occur in patches. © 2015, Universidad de Costa Rica.

AB  - The objective of the present study was to verify if, in foristic terms of natural regeneration, a restored bauxite mine in southeast Brazil can be considered successfully restored. Forty plots of 3.0 x 3.0 m were allocated in the area. All shrubs and trees with height ≥ 0.30 m and diameter at 1.30 m height (DBH) ≤ 5.0 cm were identifed and classifed into successional categories and dispersal syndromes; DSL (diameter at soil level) and height were measured. We use the canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) to verify the correlations between environmental variables (canopy openness, litter decomposition, soil penetration resistance) and vegetation. We found 705 individuals, 80 species and 30 families. The families with the highest species richness were Fabaceae and Melastomataceae. The specie with the highest importance value (IV) was Myrcia splendens. Most species are the early secondary successional category and the zoochoric dispersion syndrome. CCA ordination indicates the formation of a group of species associated with less soil compaction and with low litter decomposition rate and the formation of another group associated with intermediate values of soil penetration resistance and litter decomposition rate. The results obtained after ten years of implementation of the restoration project, in foristic terms, are suitable. In other words, the area can be considered as successfully restored. © 2014, Universidad Austral de Chile. All Rights reserved.

AB  - Brazilian environmental law (the Forest Code) compels large landowners to conserve a proportion of forest on their properties, often necessitating restoration of degraded habitat. Sugar cane producers have been active participants in these restoration projects, especially in the northeast region where sugar cane has largely replaced the exceptionally biodiverse Atlantic forest. Despite the potential conservation importance of such restoration projects there have been few evaluations of their outcomes. Here, we assess sugar cane company restoration projects in an Atlantic rainforest region of northeast Brazil. Specifically, we assess the ability of restoration projects to: (i) restore species diversity and vegetation structure; (ii) increase connectivity between forest fragments, and; (iii) restore assemblage composition. Restored areas contained approximately half the species richness of remnant fragments and had a substantially different species composition. Moreover, the density of trees in restored areas was a third of that in remnants, despite a very similar height profile. The currently poor outcomes of Atlantic Forest restoration projects in northeast Brazil are a consequence of a severely limited capacity for natural regeneration and poor restoration practices. We conclude by identifying possible strategies to improve the quality of privately financed restoration projects. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Seed predators and dispersers may drive the speed and structure of forest regeneration in natural ecosystems. Rodents and ants prey upon and disperse seeds, yet empirical studies on the magnitude of these effects are lacking. Here, we examined the role of ants and rodents on seed predation in 4 plant species in a successional gradient on a tropical rainforest island. We found that (1) seeds are mostly consumed rather than dispersed; (2) rates of seed predation vary by habitat, season, and species; (3) seed size, shape, and hardness do not affect the probability of being depredated. Rodents were responsible for 70% of seed predation and were negligible (0.14%) seed dispersers, whereas ants were responsible for only 2% of seed predation and for no dispersal. We detected seasonal and habitat effects on seed loss, with higher seed predation occurring during the wet season and in old-growth forests. In the absence of predators regulating seed-consumer populations, the densities of these resilient animals explode to the detriment of natural regeneration and may reduce diversity and carrying capacity for consumers and eventually lead to ecological meltdown. © 2014 Fleury et al.

AB  - The goal of this study was to evaluate the population structure of Lonchocarpus cultratus located in a riparian zone in the flood plain of the upper Paraná River. Data were collected on the stem diameter at breast height (DBH) and the plant height from two phytosociological inventories, which were performed with a 14-year interval, using data collected in studies conducted in 1992 and 2006 in an Atlantic Forest riparian zone remnant of Paraná State, Brazil. Class intervals for DBH and plant height were defined using the Spiegel equation, and the measured values were distributed between the different distinct classes. The distribution of individuals between the different DBH classes was analyzed using de Liocourt’s quotient (q). For both stages of the study, the DBH distribution resulted in an inverted-J curve, as expected for uneven-aged forests. The distribution of the height values was irregular, as expected for an early succession species. The de Liocourt q indicated an unbalanced distribution for both stages. However, there was a tendency towards balance in the second stage. The results imply that the studied population was maturing and maintaining its self-regenerating capacity while tending towards balance and presenting behavior characteristic of early succession species. © 2016, Eduem - Editora da Universidade Estadual de Maringa.

AB  - Hesperiidae are claimed to be a group of elusive butterflies that need major effort for sampling, thus being frequently omitted from tropical butterfly surveys. As no studies have associated species richness patterns of butterflies with environmental gradients of high altitudes in Brazil, we surveyed Hesperiidae ensembles in Serra do Mar along elevational transects (900-1,800 m above sea level) on three mountains. Transects were sampled 11-12 times on each mountain to evaluate how local species richness is influenced by mountain region, vegetation type, and elevational zones. Patterns were also analyzed for the subfamilies, and after disregarding species that exhibit hilltopping behavior. Species richness was evaluated by the observed richness, Jacknife2 estimator and Chao 1 estimator standardized by sample coverage. Overall, 155 species were collected, but extrapolation algorithms suggest a regional richness of about 220 species. Species richness was far higher in forest than in early successional vegetation or grassland. Richness decreased with elevation, and was higher on Anhangava mountain compared with the two others. Patterns were similar between observed and extrapolated Jacknife2 richness, but vegetation type and mountain richness became altered using sample coverage standardization. Hilltopping species were more easily detected than species that do not show this behavior; however, their inclusion did neither affect estimated richness nor modify the shape of the species accumulation curve. This is the first contribution to systematically study highland butterflies in southern Brazil where all records above 1,200 m are altitudinal extensions of the known geographical ranges of skipper species in the region. © 2013 Sociedade Entomológica do Brasil.

AB  - Studies on the dynamics of ecosystems undergoing restoration are needed to verify whether they are following the expected trajectory, developing in unexpected ways, or becoming stabilized in a non desirable intermediate stage of blocked succession. In order to elucidate the successional trajectory of the plant community in a 20 ha patch of riparian Atlantic Forest (southeastern Brazil) undergoing restoration, we assessed native tree and shrub species regenerating at 18, 28 and 38 years after planting. We analyzed changes in floristic composition and proportions of functional traits, by comparison with the set of 166 species originally planted most of which were non-native, and with the plant assemblages of two reference riparian ecosystems-a primary-type and a secondary forest, in the same eco-region. Despite isolation from extant forests, immigrating native species have enriched and dominated the community undergoing restoration. Thus, the floristic composition and the proportions of species among functional guilds is becoming more distinct through time from the set of species planted and more similar to the nearest secondary forest (1.6 km), but is still dramatically different from that of a primary forest 50 km away. The proportions of functional guilds among individuals regenerating have shown stability over time but differ in general from the primary forest, particularly for the higher proportion of zoochorous plants in the forest undergoing restoration. The proportion of non-native species as well as of individuals of these species in the community have decreased over time, even though they were the majority of the species planted, refuting the hypothesis of priority effect driving the community assembly.

AB  - In light of the devastating loss of forest cover, biodiversity, and ecosystem services in the Atlantic Forest of Brazil, people are endeavoring to restore this fragmented forest system. The afforestation of abandoned or degraded land is a practical approach to restore regional ecological functions and to sequester atmospheric carbon to help mitigate the global imbalance of atmospheric carbon associated with climate change. Large gaps, however, remain in understanding the dynamics of afforested tree communities. In this study, the effect of topographical relief and soil properties on growth performance of planted trees has been assessed. Above ground dry biomass (AGBdry) accumulation was estimated to evaluate the performance of afforested tree communities on formerly abandoned pastures at the Reserva Ecológica de Guapiaçu, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The study revealed large discrepancies in AGBdry and respective organic carbon accumulationThe afforested tree community located on the sloped terrain stored only half the carbon (21.70±7.3Mgha-1) that the planted trees on the flat terrain stored. (46.67±8.7Mgha-1). Our results suggest that differences in tree growth performance are complex, depending largely on topography and related soil conditions. These circumstances should be considered to prevent misleading carbon sink estimates when developing regional strategies for Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD+) that promote afforestation activities. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Key message: Environmental filters select species with different characteristics. However, these do not exhibit the functional integration of the whole plant level. Abstract: Functional integration at the whole plant level, between the strategies of the various plant organs, needs to be better elucidated to facilitate the understanding of species ecology over an environmental gradient. Thus, hypotheses were proposed that (1) if functional integration exists between organs, the leaf economic spectrum will be a good indicator of the plant economic spectrum, and that (2) processes of community assembly will change over a successional gradient, generating different economic spectra for the plant. To test these predictions, data on eight functional characteristics (leaf, reproductive, stem and whole plant) was collected in 65 species, distributed in six secondary growth forests (three with approximately 17 years and three with approximately 25 years of abandonment) and three mature forests, located within the dense ombrophilous forest domain in the northern coastal region of Pernambuco, Brazil. The results showed no influence of geographic distance (autocorrelation) or phylogeny. Positive correlations were observed between leaf nutrient concentration (N and P), and negative correlations were observed between leaf nutrient concentration and dry matter content. Functional integration at the whole plant level was not observed. On the primary axis of the principal components analysis, only leaf characteristics and wood density were coordinates, following the same strategy, whilst on the secondary axis, only leaf characteristics and maximum height were coordinates. The observed change in species composition and abundance over the gradient was sufficient for changes in the distribution of functional characteristics and, therefore in strategies, to be observed. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Riparian forests provide essential ecosystem services to humanity, but are being degraded at an accelerated rate in the Amazon. Tis study aimed to quantify carbon stocks above and below ground in riparian forests with four levels of degradation (very high, high, medium and low) in two watersheds (Pepital Rio and Rio Grande) in Alcântara, Eastern Amazon. Twenty-four permanent plots of 1,000 m2 were installed, and vegetation (trees, shrubs, herbs, lianas and palms), necromass (litter, dead trees, branches) and soil (0-20 cm and roots) were sampled. The biomass was estimated using allometric models (vegetation with dbh> 1 cm and dead trees) and destructively (herbaceous, litterfall, branches, roots). The total carbon stock in the most conserved riparian forests ranged between 88 and 202 Mg(C) ha-1. Degradation significantly reduced carbon stock in all compartments (up to 97% in above-ground biomass, up to 91% of necromass, and up to 47% in soils). In conserved areas, the aboveground biomass is the largest compartment of the total carbon stock (> 70%), mainly due to large trees. The carbon stock in the diferent compartments are strongly correlated with each other and with the canopy opening. The incorporation of these results in regional carbon models can assist in the implementation and review of the Brazilian Forest Act, particularly in the restoration of riparian forests where agriculture is consolidated. © 2015, Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas da Amazonia.

AB  - This work aimed to assess the effect of spacing, arrangement and ecological group composition of planted seedlings on the restoration process of artificial reservoir shores in southeastern Brazil. The assessments were performed 12 years after the settlement of the experiment in which five mixed stand models were tested. First, a general evaluation of the stand was performed when we surveyed the overstory and understory, seed bank and soil for chemical analysis. Then, the restoration indicators survival of planted trees, basal area and density of the tree community, litter accumulated on the soil and canopy closure index were utilized to compare the plantation models and to assess the influence the experimental factors on these parameters. In the general analysis, we found that the studied stand presents low diversity, poor regeneration, and seed bank dominated mostly by one planted exotic tree species and weeds, which may jeopardize the self-maintenance of the stand in the future. The factor that most influenced the models was the ecological group composition with the best performance found for models in which both pioneer and non-pioneer groups were used. Probably, the plantation arrangement and spacing did not have greater influence due to both plant mortality and natural regeneration that has developed to this age. Hence, it is not recommended the use of only pioneer species in the implantation of riparian forest and the proportion of 50% pioneers and 50% non-pioneers using as much species as possible is indicated for areas that might present constraints for the natural regeneration. © 2016, Universidade Federal de Santa Maria.

AB  - This paper aims at characterizing the tree species natural regeneration and evaluating the relation of this stratum to both the adult component and the environmental variables in a fragment of a cloud forest in Santa Catarina, Brazil. In each of 25 20 × 20 m plots, where the adult component and environmental variables have previously been evaluated, subplots of different sizes varying according to plants’ height were then allocated as follows: Class 1-plants with a height varying from 0.15 cm up to 1 m, being evaluated within 5 m2; Class 2-plants with a height varying from 1 up to 3 m, being evaluated within 10 m2; Class 3-plants with a height greater than 3 m and DBH smaller than 5 cm, being evaluated within 20 m2. Data have been analyzed with regard to the determination of diversity (Shannon index), evenness (Pielou), Natural Regeneration Index (NRI), similarity with the adult component (Jaccard and Bray-Curtis), floristic-structural organization (Nonmetric Multidimensional Scaling-NMDS) and their relation to environmental variables. A total of 518 individuals distributed in 28 species were sampled. The low values of Shannon index (2.51 nat/ind) and evenness (0.75) suggest low diversity and elevated ecological dominance. The highest NRI has been found in the species Symphyopappus itatiayensis (Hieron.) R.M.King & H.Rob (19.36%). The similarity with the adult component were of 0.45 (Jaccard) and 0.24 (Bray-Curtis), demonstrating a low overall similarity (<0.50). The soil compaction was the only variable that has shown a relation with regeneration, which can be related to cattle’s presence in the fragment. © 2016 Sociedade de Investigacoes Florestais.

AB  - Ecologically relevant restoration of secondary Atlantic forest on abandoned land offers a potential means to recover biodiversity and improve crucial ecosystem services, including carbon sequestration. Early secondary successional trajectories are determined by a range of environmental factors that influence plant community development. Context-specific understanding of forest vegetation communities, their dynamics, and underlying drivers is needed for future restoration strategies. In this study we examined relationships between soil (chemical and physical) and environmental (landscape and topographical) characteristics, plant community attributes, and carbon stocks during early secondary succession. Data were collected at two sites undergoing early secondary succession in seasonally-dry Atlantic Forest (Rio de Janeiro State, Brazil). Both sites were previously used for pasture and abandoned at similar times, but showed differing vegetation communities. We found tree biomass and diversity and ecosystem carbon storage to be strongly positively related to the amount of surrounding forest, less steep slopes and clay soils, and negatively to the abundance of the shrub Leandra aurea. Soil carbon pools significantly increased with aboveground tree biomass. The only factor significantly affecting the metric of overall successional development (combining tree biomass and diversity) was total surrounding forest cover. Our findings suggest recovery of secondary forest and below- and aboveground carbon storage is limited by the amount of adjacent forest, some soil properties and dense shrub establishment down-regulating the succession process. Overall we offer evidence of potential to improve recovery of Atlantic forest with ecologically relevant seeding/planting programmes and selective shrub removal that could benefit ecosystem carbon storage. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - This study aimed to evaluate the structure and diversity of the tree community in a secondary semidecidous forest at UFJF Botanical Garden (Juiz de Fora, Minas Gerais, Brazil). The trees (dbh ≥ 5 cm) were sampled at 25 random plots of 20 m × 20 m. A total of 2535 individuals were sampled, 385 standing dead and 2150 life, belonging to 105 species and 39 families. As a reflection of strong ecological dominance, the index value of species diversity (Shannon H'= 3.30 nats.ind-1) was low compared to secondary forests of the region. The standing dead trees represent 15.2% of individuals, a high proportion compared to secondary forests. Detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) resulted in short gradients, showing a low internal species heterogeneity. There was a strong predominance of species of early succession stages (pioneer and early secondary). The results show that, although the forest has undergone over 70 years of natural regeneration, the tree community presents a slow succession process, with low diversity and characteristics of an immature forest. In contrast, the area has endangered species and some families typical of mature forest (Lauraceae and Myrtaceae). In other words, the fragment is important for the preservation of regional biodiversity.

AB  - We documented litter production and seed rain in fragments of semideciduous forest (SDF) in the western part of the state of Paraná, Brazil: a late successional fragment (LF); an early successional fragment (EF); and a reforested late successional fragment (RLF). In each fragment, we established three permanent plots with four litter traps each, corresponding to 12 litter traps per fragment. Botanical material was collected monthly between June 2011 and May 2012. We sorted the material by category: leaves; branches; reproductive structures; and miscellaneous. We analyzed the seed rain using the reproductive structures. Annual production was highest (11,560 kg.ha-1) in the LF, followed by the RLF, with 9330 kg.ha-1, and the EF, with 7838 kg.ha-1. The RLF yielded 7167 diaspores, from 33 species, compared with 4751 diaspores, from 38 species, for the EF; in both fragments, pioneer and anemochorous species predominated. The LF yielded 2173 diaspores, from 49 species, among which late secondary and climax species with zoochorous dispersal predominated. We observed asynchrony in the frequency of diaspore production of trees and lianas. Our data describe the dynamics of plant assemblages in SDF fragments and provide information on successional stages, dispersion syndromes, patterns of asynchrony, deciduousness, reproductive periods, and resource availability for frugivores. © 2014, Sociedade Botanica do Brasil.

AB  - Forest management can result in net losses of carbon stock. To quantify the impact of the management it is important to assess losses or gains of carbon, as well as the sustainability of the management system. This study quantified the impact management under a Small-Scale Sustainable Forest Management Plan, which is a recently created category of authorized management for small managers in the state of Amazonas, Brazil. Impact was quantified on the number of individuals, the biomass of natural regeneration, and the damage to the remaining trees 2 months after logging. The impact of these changes on carbon stock was estimated. The study was carried out in the Uatumã Sustainable Development Reserve, Amazonas, Brazil, where two areas of small-scale forest management and one control were evaluated. Average total carbon stock previous to logging was estimated at 161.25 ± 9.66 MgC ha-1. Two months after logging, reductions were found of 3% in one managed area (MA1) and 8.3% in the other (MA3), including the carbon stock from the harvested timber. For each harvested tree, the logging caused damage to 12 trees in MA1 and four trees in MA3. The reductions in carbon stock and number of trees damaged per harvested tree were less than the reductions found for higher impact forest management and other experiences in community forest management. No significant alteration was found in the carbon stock of natural regeneration. However, there was an increase in the number of individuals, both in the logged areas and in their respective control areas. © 2014 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Guinea-grass (Megathyrsus maximus (Jacq.) B.K. Simon & S.W.L. Jacobs - Poaceae) is an invasive C4 grass that known to slow ecological succession in restoration sites. This study aimed to evaluate the responses of the woody species and M. maximus itself to manual removal in a 20-year-old reforestation site. Forty-five 5. ×. 5-m plots were established in 2008 and evaluated until 2012. The plots were divided into three treatments: control (CON), manual removal for one year (MR1), and manual removal for two years (MR2). All individuals of woody species >10. cm were sampled. Canopy cover, grass cover, and the number of seedlings of M. maximus were also recorded. After the first weeding, M. maximus seedlings were manually uprooted every four months, for a total of three times in MR1 (2008-2009) and six times in MR2 (2008-2010). After the manual removal was stopped, the seedlings of M. maximus were counted and were allowed to grow in order to assess its reestablishment potential. The number of new grass seedlings decreased drastically after the first year with repeated removals and did not differ between removal treatments at any time, even after removals halted, indicating that one year of removal was sufficient to displace the grass. With the exclusion of Guinea-grass, an increase in the abundance and richness of other exotic species was observed until the second year. However, the increase in canopy cover during the four years likely benefited native woody species and impaired M. maximus and other exotics. In addition, after four years, although the woody species richness did not differ between the three treatments, the total abundance and pioneer species richness were higher in both removal treatments. These findings suggest that the grass slows ecological succession. However, both the increase in canopy cover and decrease in grass cover indicate that, in the absence of fire, native vegetation will suppress Guinea-grass. Furthermore, grass removal from the understory of early secondary forests and reforestations can be used to accelerate succession, reducing both fire risk and failures of ecological restoration initiatives. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Bracatinga (Mimosa scabrella Bentham) is an important pioneer tree species in Ombrophylous Mixed Forest of Brazil and is widely used as an energy source. In traditional agroforestry systems, regeneration is induced by fire, then pure and dense stands known as bracatinga stands (bracatingais) are formed. In the first year, annual crops are intercalated with the seedlings. At that time the seedlings are thinned, then the stands remain at a fallow period and cut at seven years old. The species is very important mainly for small landowners. We studied the understory species that occur naturally during the succession over several years in order to manage them rationally in the future and maintain the natural vegetation over time. Three to 20 year-old Bracatinga stands were sampled between 1998 and 2011. All tree species with diameter at breast height (DBH) ≥ 5 cm were measured.The floristic evolution was assessed with respect to Sociability Index, the Shannon Diversity Index and the Pielou Evenness Index. Graphs of rank/abundance over different age groups were evaluated using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. We identified 153 species dispersed throughout the understory and tend to become aggregated over time. © 2016, Academia Brasileira de Ciencias. All rights reserved.

AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the structure (horizontal and vertical) of a Deciduous Forest, located between the municipalities of Piratuba and Ipira (SC). 14.000 m2 of tree communities were analyzed, sub- divided into 14 plots of 10 x 100 m, where all individuals with DBH equal to or greater than 4.0 cm were sampled and identified. For natural regeneration were sampled 560 m2, divided into 14 plots of 10 x 4 m. In the tree strata were sampled 2.125 individuals belonging to 34 families, 80 genera and 113 species with a total density of 1.517 ind.ha-1. Natural regeneration were sampled 196 individuals belonging to 24 families and 49 species with a total density of 3.500 ind. ha-1. Luehea divaricata Mart., Actinostemon concolor (Spreng) Müll. Arg. and Parapiptadenia rigida (Benth.) Brenan had of value of increased importance (7,1%, 7,0 % and 5,3%, respectively). Actinostemon concolor got high value Relative Natural Regeneration (18,1%). The low percentage of natural regeneration of species as Luehea divaricata and Parapiptadenia rigida, respectively 3,7% and 1,5%, typical of EDF, may represent a maintenance commitment in the community. The study revealed the presence of exotic species with invasive potential, as Hovenia dulcis Thumb. These facts point to the importance of the adoption of management measures, since the forest fragment studied is advancing successional terms, however, anthropogenic interference with signals in the floristic composition.

AB  - We analyzed the structures of two mangrove forests of Paraná (Brazil) (Antonina Bay and Guaratuba Bay), considering adult trees and regeneration component. In each area, we marked three sub-areas and sampled five plots of 10 x 10 m, equivalent to 0.05 ha to adults trees and fifteen 1 x 1m sub-plots to assess the regeneration component. Avicennia schaueriana, Rhizophora mangle and Laguncularia racemosa exhibited distinct dominance and relative density between the areas. Mangroves of Antonina and Guaratuba differed both in the structure of natural regeneration as the tree component. The Principal Coordinates Analysis (PCoA) show that differences between areas in relation to abiotic variables of soil are strongly related to the structural parameters of trees. The different types of mangrove soil are the most significant factor in the differentiation between the mangrove areas since influences the salinity values and consequent adaptability of plants. © 2016, Universidade Federal de Santa Maria.

AB  - We assess the relation between the contrasting vegetation types of rainforest, open savanna and wooded savanna coexisting in close contact on Marajó Island at the mouth of the Amazon River. Floristic and carbon isotopic characterizations of modern plants were combined with organic matter carbon isotope and grain size records of soil to characterize vegetation evolution at six locations on southeastern and northeastern Marajó Island and its relations to climate changes since the late Pleistocene. C3 plants contribute 100% of the biomass in the rainforest on post-Barreiras sediments (site 1). No significant vegetation changes are evident in these places since at least ~7860calyrB.P. Rainforests on paleochannels (sites 4 and 6) are protected from flooding by slightly elevated sandy levee and have flora very similar to site 1. These forests were formed since the early-mid Holocene after channel abandonment. C3 grasses are predominant in open savanna areas (sites 4, 5 and 6), with less representation in wooded savannas (sites 2 and 3). However, C4 grasses, despite having fewer species, constitute significant biomass in the wooded (~60%) and open savanna vegetation areas, especially during the dry season. The reconstructions of past vegetation together with the distributions of modern vegetation allow prediction that climate changes to drier conditions can significantly influence the future Marajó Island landscape, likely enabling expansion of C4 plants in the flooding zone and of trees in the rainforests. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - We present an integrated palaeoecological and archaeobotanical study of pre-Columbian raised-field agriculture in the Llanos de Moxos, a vast seasonally inundated forest-savanna mosaic in the Bolivian Amazon. Phytoliths from excavated raised-field soil units, together with pollen and charcoal in sediment cores from two oxbow lakes, were analysed to provide a history of land use and agriculture at the El Cerro raised-field site. The construction of raised fields involved the removal of savanna trees, and gallery forest was cleared from the area by ad 310. Despite the low fertility of Llanos de Moxos soils, we determined that pre-Columbian raised-field agriculture sufficiently improved soil conditions for maize cultivation. Fire was used as a common management practice until ad 1300, at which point, the land-use strategy shifted towards less frequent burning of savannas and raised fields. Alongside a reduction in the use of fire, sweet potato cultivation and the exploitation of Inga fruits formed part of a mixed resource strategy from ad 1300 to 1450. The pre-Columbian impact on the landscape began to lessen around ad 1450, as shown by an increase in savanna trees and gallery forest. Although agriculture at the site began to decline prior to European arrival, the abandonment of raised fields was protracted, with evidence of sweet potato cultivation occurring as late as ad 1800. © The Author(s) 2014.

AB  - The objective of the present study was to compare the composition and structure of the soil seed banks of a Forest Restoration (FR) and a Reference Ecosystem (RE). To this end, 60 samples of 30×30×5 cm topsoil were collected in the Reserva Natural Vale located in Linhares, Espirito Santo state, Brazil. Individuals of 25 species and 15 botanical families germinated for six months. The study found increased density of Urochloa decumbens (brachiaria) in the FR, an invasive species which inhibits the process of ecological succession, representing a problem in cases of possible disturbances. On the other hand, the presence of facilitative succession species such as Cecropia and Trema in the FR were characterized positively, because these species are responsible for forest regeneration after disturbances and they were not used during the planting of the area, that is, the forest restoration is behaving as an ecosystem that already presents resilience to disturbances such as the creation of gaps.

AB  - We investigated the efficiency of different kinds of perches in attracting seed disperser-birds and increasing the seed rain in a degraded area located in the northeast region of São Paulo State. We installed seed traps under natural perches (NPs, living trees); simple artificial perches (SAPs) of 3m tall and a crossbar; elaborate artificial perches (EAPs) of 7m tall and three crossbars, and in a control area. Results showed the number of bird-dispersed seeds deposited was proportional to the number of structures for perching. The NPs also have provided other resources for birds such as food and shelter. Comparing visitation between artificial perches, there was greater use of EAPs also for having more perching structures and for being taller, providing better airspace visibility for predatory birds and tyrant-flycatchers, important seed dispersers. Thus, natural and artificial perches with similar characteristics to the EAPs are the most recommended as a base or complementary method for the restoration of degraded areas near to propagules source, also contributing to the maintenance of local fauna. © 2016, Instituto Internacional de Ecologia.

AB  - Background and aims – The use of fire as a managing tool influences and maintains many types of vegetation and may determine landscape physiognomy and species composition. Fire has a strong effect on lichens but studies about their recolonization or resistance are rare. Considering this, the objectives of this study are to investigate how fire impacts the structure of saxicolous lichen communities on rocks in grassland, considering richness, cover and lichen taxa composition and to verify if there are changes on functional diversity and redundancy among sites with different fire events. Methods – The study was undertaken in an area composed of mosaics of native Araucaria forests and grasslands, in southern Brazil, where two sites were sampled. One of them experienced a recent intense fire episode, after being fifteen years without fire or grazing influence, and the other was regularly subjected to grazing and annual fire episodes. Key results – The sites differed in lichen cover, lichen taxa richness and composition. Regarding the environmental and structural variables of the surrounding vegetation, significant influence on saxicolous lichen communities was also observed, with taller vegetation and greater vegetation cover on the rocky outcrops from the site with only one and intense recent fire event. Functional diversity and functional redundancy was also significantly different between both sites. Conclusion – Based on these results it is possible to affirm that managing southern Brazilian natural grasslands with annual fire and grazing, unless it is not too intense, does not prevent the development of saxicolous lichen communities. The effect of fire on abandoned grasslands, with a high quantity of organic matter and taller vegetation, is importantly negative to saxicolous lichen community. Lichens take more time to grow and occupy the rock than the surrounding vegetation recovers, which can cause microclimate changes. The recolonization of these rocky outcrops can therefore take a long time and the new lichen community will probably never be the same as the former one. © 2015 Botanic Garden Meise and Royal Botanical Society of Belgium.

AB  - This study was conducted in a fragment of semideciduous seasonal forest (SSF), located in Sorocaba (SP, Brazil), in order to verify its successional stage and infer from the future composition. Our hypothesis was that the fragment would present regeneration with low diversity of species; with predominance of pioneer species of canopy and absence of resident species in the understory and predominance of anemochoric and autochoric species. We used the parcels method, considering the individuals in three size classes, two of them referring to rhe understory and one to the canopy (1 - < 100 cm; 2 - >100 cm and circumference at soil height < 15cm; 3 - > 15cm. We sampled 146 species, and class 2 understory species presented the highest diversity levels. The similarity between the three classes was low. Considering the species with the highest importance values, five are pioneer and five are non pioneer. Contesting the initial hypothesis, these characteristics, plus the predominance of the zoochorich species in the three species, indicate that the fragment is in an intermediate stage of succession and has microclimatic conditions that allow the entrance and presence of species that need areas with more shadow. Species like Aspidosperma olivaceum, Cordia trichotoma, Ocotea elegans and Guarea guidonia, considered as non pioneer and transitory species, were sampled only in classes 1 and 2, which shows the future species replacement and the sucessional progress of the fragment. © 2014, Sociedade de Investigacoes Florestais.

AB  - Majority of invasive trees colonize grasslands, shrublands, and temperate forests. Hovenia dulcis is an exception, because it is one of the most pervasive invaders in Brazilian subtropical forests where it has changed their structure and composition. This study has aimed to identify the clues for its success by defining the structural and functional characteristics of plant communities in different stages of succession with and without H. dulcis. Following the general assumptions of invasion ecology, we expected that H. dulcis establishment and invasion success would be significantly higher in early successional communities, with high resource availability and low species richness and diversity, as well as low functional diversity. Contrary to this hypothesis, no differences were found between plant communities invaded and non-invaded by H. dulcis at three different succession stages. No relationship was found between species richness and diversity and functional diversity, with respect to invasibility along the successional gradient. Hovenia dulcis is strongly associated with semi-open vegetation, where the species was found in higher density. The invasion of open vegetation is more recent, providing evidence of the species’s ability to invade plant communities in early successional stages. We concluded that the colonization by H. dulcis was associated with forest openness, but the species is also able to colonize semi-open vegetation, and persist in the successionally more advanced communities. © 2014, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.

AB  - The abandonment of field crops and the vegetation recovery in exhausted soils have been a recently studied subject as a way to assess the forest role on the soil recovering. The aim of this study was assess changes in the chemical (14 variables) and grain size (sand, silt, and clay) soil features in four forests chronosequences grew over abandoned field crops in the edge of the Brazilian Southern plateau, Rio Grande do Sul State. There were selected 25 forests aging from 5 to > 100 years old in areas of slopes and highlands where samples of Leptosols and Regosols were collected at 15cm in depth. The Fisher’s Discriminant Analysis showed that some variable groups of soils can distinguish significantly the soils under different forest ages. Six chemical features of soil fertility were the best monitoring indicators of areas impacted by agriculture. Changes in soil did not occur in a linear way towards time. © 2015, Universidade Federal de Santa Maria. All rights reserved.

AB  - Given growing concerns about biodiversity loss and carbon emissions stemming from tropical deforestation, it is important to identify the factors associated with land abandonment as they might indicate areas that were deforested but are unsuitable for long-term cultivation. This article utilizes a high-resolution, Landsat-based data-set called TerraClass to relate land abandonment to precipitation, slope, farmgate price of beef, market access, soil quality, and land tenure characteristics in the Brazilian Amazon. The spatially explicit statistical models reveal that rates of land abandonment increase with higher rainfall and slope values, even when controlling for distance to roads, farmgate prices, type of settlement, and soil quality. Moreover, land adjacent to a major road is more likely to be consistently cultivated, but land near large rivers and far from highways is more likely to be abandoned. Land ownership type also influences the likelihood of land abandonment as settlements based on communal property rights have higher rates of land abandonment than settlements with private lots. These results suggest that policies aimed at occupying tropical forests such as the Amazon must consider these biophysical and socioeconomic factors in order to foster human development aligned with sustainability principles. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - The Atlantic Forest suffered five centuries of continuous deforestation related to successive economic cycles, and is now reduced to 11.7 % of its original cover. The Atlantic Forest Restoration Pact was launched in 2009 and aims to restore 15 million hectares until 2050. Natural regeneration can play an important role in meeting this target, however little attention has been paid to this process and there is a gap in the knowledge about its driving factors at the landscape scale. We mapped forest cover of an Atlantic Forest municipality in Southeastern Brazil, in five timeslots between years 1978 and 2014, and used the weights of evidence method for modeling its spatial dynamics, in order to understand where natural regeneration is occurring and which are the main factors related to this phenomenon. In 36 years, forest cover increased 3,020 hectares (15.3 %), related to the decreasing of both rural population (R2 = 0.9794, p = 0.0013) and cropland cover (R2 = 0.8679, p = 0.0212). Landscape metrics shows the increment of number of fragments and structural connectivity among them. The main spatial variables influencing forest cover dynamics were topographic position, slope, solar radiation, soil type and distance to forest, urban areas and roads. Secondary forests provide ecosystem services that can turn into economic benefits, and natural regeneration can reduce restoration costs to the municipality. The cost of active restoration of the same area would have meant a total expense of U$ 15.1 million (U$ 419 k/year). We show here that spontaneous regeneration must be accounted for and incorporated into the spatial planning of Atlantic Forest restoration. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - The removal of original vegetation for crops and pasture production and then followed by natural regeneration is a standard practice in the Atlantic Forest, which has produced patches with different degrees of degradation and regeneration across the landscape. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of replacement of native forest by pasture and natural regeneration of vegetation on soil and on soil organic matter (SOM) dynamics in the dry and rainy season in an Atlantic Forest fragment in Passa Vinte, Minas Gerais (MG), Brazil. Soil samples were collected in the rainy and dry season, at a depth of 0.00-0.05 m. The variables determined were total organic carbon (TOC) and particle-size fractions of SOM [particulate organic carbon (POC) and mineral-associated organic carbon (MOC)]; microbial activity by basal respiration (BR) and microbial biomass carbon (MBC); species richness (SR) and spore abundance (SA) of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF); and total and easily extractable glomalin-related soil protein (T-GRSP and EE-GRSP, respectively). The conversion of native forest into pasture reduced TOC, POC, MOC, AMF-SA, T-GRSP, and EE-GRSP. However, it did not reduce MBC and BR. The fallow period in the area under natural regeneration was not long enough to restore soil TOC, POC, MOC, BR, MBC, T-GRSP, and EE-GRSP to levels approaching those observed in the forest area. Nevertheless, natural regeneration of vegetation stimulated the production of seedlings (spores) of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, which are important for the establishment of plant species and advance of ecological succession. Seasonality affected some of the biological soil properties and SOM dynamics. © 2016, Revista Brasileira de Ciencia do Solo. All rights reserved.

AB  - We developed a method to reconstruct land use history from Landsat images time-series. The method uses a breakpoint detection framework derived from the econometrics field and applicable to time-series regression models. The Breaks For Additive Season and Trend (BFAST) framework is used for defining the time-series regression models which may contain trend and phenology, hence appropriately modelling vegetation intra and inter-annual dynamics. All available Landsat data are used for a selected study area, and the time-series are partitioned into segments delimited by breakpoints. Segments can be associated to land use regimes, while the breakpoints then correspond to shifts in land use regimes. In order to further characterize these shifts, we classified the unlabelled breakpoints returned by the algorithm into their corresponding processes. We used a Random Forest classifier, trained from a set of visually interpreted time-series profiles to infer the processes and assign labels to the breakpoints. The whole approach was applied to quantifying the number of cultivation cycles in a swidden agriculture system in Brazil (state of Amazonas). Number and frequency of cultivation cycles is of particular ecological relevance in these systems since they largely affect the capacity of the forest to regenerate after land abandonment. We applied the method to a Landsat time-series of Normalized Difference Moisture Index (NDMI) spanning the 1984–2015 period and derived from it the number of cultivation cycles during that period at the individual field scale level. Agricultural fields boundaries used to apply the method were derived using a multi-temporal segmentation approach. We validated the number of cultivation cycles predicted by the method against in-situ information collected from farmers interviews, resulting in a Normalized Residual Mean Squared Error (NRMSE) of 0.25. Overall the method performed well, producing maps with coherent spatial patterns. We identified various sources of error in the approach, including low data availability in the 90s and sub-object mixture of land uses. We conclude that the method holds great promise for land use history mapping in the tropics and beyond. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - We compared seed fate (survival, mortality by rodent predators, desiccation and other causes) of the tree Cavanillesia arborea (Malvaceae) in preserved old-growth tropical dry forests and in nearby abandoned pasturelands in Brazil. For this purpose, we performed an experiment where 15 seeds were placed in the surroundings of 15 parental individuals in each habitat. These 450 seeds were monitored over four months. At the end of the experiment, seed predation by rodents was higher in forest (56.5%) than in pasture (8.9%) areas, but seed desiccation showed the opposite pattern (8.9% vs. 80.4%). Mortality by desiccation was also faster in pasture than in forest areas, probably reducing their attractiveness to predators in these areas. None of the seeds placed in the pasture survived, whereas 26.2% of seeds became seedlings in forest areas. The absence of seedling recruitment of Cavanillesia arborea in pastures is likely a consequence of their incapacity to tolerate the harsh abiotic conditions in this habitat. Thus, forest conversion imposes a strong limitation to the long-term population viability of this species. However, restoration and natural regeneration of abandoned pastures can recreate the forest structure and microclimatic conditions favourable to seed germination and seedling establishment. Remnant individuals of Cavanillesia arborea in agricultural landscapes may have a negligible contribution to current recruitment, but they can attract potential dispersers of pioneer species, with positive feedbacks to future recruitment during secondary succession. © 2015 Ecological Society of Australia.

AB  - Niche and neutral processes shape community assembly with a possible shift of niche and neutral importance in communities undergoing temporal changes during succession. Functional diversity helps to discriminate assembly processes since trait distribution is dependent on those processes. We evaluated the changes in reproductive traits related to pollination and seed dispersal in a successional gradient in an Atlantic Forest area, Southern Brazil. We surveyed forests undergoing regeneration varying in age from 2 to 80 years after pasture abandonment. We expected an increase in functional diversity of reproductive traits and a greater role of limiting similarity across succession. Abiotic and mixed pollination systems, dioecious sexual system, biotic dispersed, many-seeded and small-seeded species decreased as the forest got older. Conversely, bee-pollinated, bell-shaped, small and androgynous flowers increased across forest succession as well biotic dispersed and large-seeded species. Functional richness and functional dispersion were higher in older forests. Changes in functional diversity were positively related to species richness, indicating that species enrichment in older forests added new sets of reproductive traits. These changes in trait distribution and functional diversity across succession in the Atlantic Forest suggest an increased role of biotic interactions and limiting similarity process structuring plant assemblages of second-growth tropical forests.

AB  - The occurrence of cerrado (as tree and shrub savanna is called in Brazil) and forest formations side by side is common at the southern margin of the Brazilian Amazonian Forest, and previous studies have demonstrated the advance of forests over cerrado areas. The aim of the present study is to provide an accurate documentation of the transition process between the two major biomes. Tree data (≥ 5 cm diameter at 0.3 m above soil level) from three plots of cerrado sensu stricto lying near three of cerradão (the taller, denser form of cerrado) were inventoried starting in 2002 in an area of 1.5 ha made up of 150 subplots of 10 × 10 m (50 in each area). This showed that the most important species of the cerradão were invading areas previously occupied by smaller, lower forms of cerrado (although it is sometimes difficult to define which are 'forest' and which 'cerrado' species as many are flexible in size - for instance Emmotum nitens can often be intermediate, establishing in cerrado that develops into cerradão and on to forest). Some typical species such as Eriotheca gracilipes and Emmotum nitens, established since the first inventories, have increased their populations (between 27 and 210%). Tachigali vulgaris, a typical, weedy, adventive species of the Cerrado-Amazonian Forest transition, showed the largest increase in abundance in areas of cerrado sensu stricto (between 100 and 1200%), and is probably the most important pioneer species in the initial advance of the forest into cerrado at the Southern Amazonian border. © Copyright 2015 Trustees of the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh.

AB  - We performed pollen analyses based on a geochronological scale and historical records in core samples from Lago das Garças Lake in the Fontes do Ipiranga State Park Biological Reserve, in the municipality of São Paulo, Brazil, to evaluate the natural regeneration processes of the Atlantic Forest in an urban area. The stratigraphy of the pollen assemblies showed temporal variations corroborating historical data on anthropogenic interventions in the region, demonstrating the interrelation of richness and the occurrence of sedimented palynomorphs according to the natural successional stages of the vegetation and anthropogenically modified environmental conditions. By integrating palynological, lithological, and geochronological results with historical references we gained a better understanding of the biological evidence for vegetation succession that could be used in recovery programs of degraded urban areas containing Atlantic Forest remnants. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - Cupressus lusitanica has a relatively low potential for fostering colonization of native species beneath the forest canopy. However, following the clearcut of a Cupressus lusitanica plantation in the State Forest of Avaré (SFA), southeastern Brazil, a vigorous regeneration of Atlantic forest tree and shrub species was observed. We evaluated the passive restoration of this site by comparing its regenerating vegetation to the vegetation established in man-made gaps in Atlantic forest in the State Park of Cantareira (SPC), southeastern Brazil. The frequency distribution of dispersal syndromes for species and the rate of reduction in abundance of pioneer species in a rank/abundance plot did not differ between the two areas. The rarefaction curves for species richness and diversity of the SPC fall below the corresponding curves of the SFA. The proportions of non-pioneer species and of individuals of non-pioneer species were greater in the SFA. The frequency distribution of dispersal syndromes for individuals differed between the two areas due mainly to a more conspicuous predominance of zoochory in the SFA. The rate of reduction in abundance of non-pioneer species in a rank/abundance plot was smaller in the SFA. We concluded that passive restoration may successfully recover native vegetation attributes following the clearcut of forest plantations without conspicuous regeneration of native species beneath the forest canopy. However, this phenomenon may be influenced by particular properties of the forest species, logging practices and faunal seed dispersal integrity. © 2016, Universidade Federal de Santa Maria.

AB  - Glacial-aged vegetation dynamics of the Humaitá-Western Brazilian Amazonia were studied by pollen, sedimentary facies, 14C dating, δ13Corg and C/Nmolar. Two sediment cores were taken to a depth of 10 and 8m from areas covered by grassland and dense/open forest, respectively. The deposits represent a succession of sediment accumulation in active channel (>42,600cal yr B.P.), abandoned channel/floodplain (>42,600 to ~39,000cal yr B.P.), and oxbow lake sedimentary environments (~39,000cal yr B.P. to modern). The predominance of mud sediments, depletion of δ13Corg and decrease in C/Nmolar values identify the lake establishment. In these settings, low energy subaqueous conditions were developed, locally favoring preservation of a pollen assemblage representing herbaceous vegetation, some modern taxa from Amazonia and cold-adapted plants from the Andes represented by Alnus (2-11%), Hedyosmum (2-17%), Weinmannia (0-18%), Podocarpus (0-4%), Ilex (0-4%) and Drymis (0-1%), at least between >42,600 and <35,200cal yr B.P. The herbs and modern taxa from Amazonia persisted through the Holocene, while the cold pollen assemblage became absent. The co-occurrence of Alnus with other cold adapted plants from the Andes during the late Pleistocene indicates that Alnus probably penetrated the Western Amazonia lowland or was growing closer to the study site due to cooler temperatures during glacial times. The present study presents the first report of a glacial age forest containing Alnus in areas of the Brazilian Amazonian lowlands. In addition to its palaeogeographical importance, this work demonstrates the effectiveness of using a combination of proxies for reconstructing sedimentary environments associated with vegetation. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The aim of this study was to assess organic matter and physical-hydric attributes of an Oxisol under a clonal planting of eucalypt and an abandoned pasture in comparison to a successional forest with its soil under natural conditions at Paragominas municipality, southeast region of the state of Pará. In July 2013, soil samples were collected at the depths 0-0.15 and 0.15-0.35 m, which were used for the determination of the following attributes: organic matter content; soil bulk density; porosity, soil water retention and S index. In field, soil water infiltration tests were performed. The abandoned pasture was the system that presented the greatest contents of organic matter in the soil surface, when compared to successional forest and eucalypt clonal plantation. None of the studied systems achieved a critical level for bulk density and S index values and all systems had water infiltration speed classified as very high. Based on these variables, the soil management with eucalypt cultivation with two years of implantation may be recommended in areas with abandoned pastures. © 2016, Federal University of Lavras.

AB  - Eucalypt planted forests are replacing natural forests in many areas of the world, impacting wildlife by diminishing availability of habitats and resources. Several species of birds require hollows in trees for nesting, and the lack of this resource may decrease richness and density of cavity-nesting birds in planted forests. The aim of this study was to compare species richness and density of cavity-nesting birds in abandoned eucalypt planted forests and natural forests in two conservation units at Minas Gerais State, southeastern Brazil. Bird surveys were conducted using 25 point counts in both areas during 2013. Species richness was estimated using Jackknife, and density was estimated using the maximum likelyhood; candidate models that could influence abundance of birds were evaluated using Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). Results showed that species richness was higher in native forests and density was significantly higher in native forests than in abandoned eucalypt planted forests, and that vegetation type and hour of day influences the abundance and detection of the birds. These results indicate that abandoned eucalypt planted forests negatively influence the cavity-nesting bird’s community, probably due to the lack of cavities or the lack of a recovered understory. Eucalypt planted forests normally do not substitute native forests and their use should be controlled in conservation areas. © 2015, Universidade de Sao Paulo. All rigths reserved.

AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the edge effect on arboreal component of two Atlantic Forest fragments, in the Watershed of Tapacurá River, Pernambuco. For the sampling of the adult component 15 plots of 10 x 25 m were plotted and subplots of 1 x 25 m for the regeneration. The plots were arranged in three environments, with five sampling units each, according to distance from the edge. Comparisons between the environments were performed by specie composition, Venn diagram and cluster analysis. The greatest richness was observed in the area farther from the edge and the greatest number of individuals near the edge. In the Mata da Onça, the farthest edge environments were similar, but different in composition and structure as compared to the nearest environment. However, in the Mata da Buchada the first two environments near to the edge were similar. The interaction between the human environment and the fragment affects the arboreal community in the fragment edges. © 2015, Federal University of Lavras. All rights Reserved.

AB  - The State of Rio de Janeiro still holds unknown portions of the Atlantic Forest, which represent gaps in the knowledge of this ecosystem. Paracambi and neighbor municipal districts comprise a vast stretch of virtually unknown forest that makes up part of the Serra do Mar biodiversity corridor. The following study describes the tree community structure in a stretch of the ombrophilous Atlantic Forest, in the Parque Natural Municipal do Curió (Curio MNP), Paracambi, Rio de Janeiro, which serves as the basis to evaluate species diversity and conservation status. The altitudes in the area ranges from 100 to 690 m and the climate varies from mild subtropical to tropical hot and humid. Forty plots (10x10m) were randomly placed along the area, where all the stems equal to or greater than five centimeters (5 cm) diameter at breast high from ground level were measured. A total of 749 individuals, pertaining to 128 genera and 210 species were recorded, eight of which are listed as threatened of extinction in the Brazilian flora. The Shannon-Weaver diversity index (H′) was 4.7 nat.ind.-1 and the species with greater importance value was Pseudopiptadenia contorta (1.6460 m2; 18 individuals) while the most common species were Senefeldera vertcilata (48) and Actinostemon verticilatus (47 individuals). Despite the sample area being a little smaller than that commonly adopted in tropical studies, data pointed to a richness hitherto not registered in any other study for the State of Rio de Janeiro, no matter the inclusion criteria used, and also confirmed by the two estimator indices used, which have revealed very similar results. The vertical forest structure, the values associated to the successional stage of the species and other aspects of community structure indicate that the Curio MNP encompasses forest stretches in advanced stages of ecological succession. Besides its key location for the connectivity of forest fragments in the region, the results emphasize the ecological importance of this forest remnant and the need for its conservation. © 2015, Universidade Estadual de Campinas UNICAMP.

AB  - Predator–prey dynamics regulate the community structure of arthropods and may be affected by changes in their habitat. Bottom-up effects influence the distribution of arboreal insects changing, in turn, the availability of resources and shelter for the spider assemblage. This study examines the effect of habitat structure (tree richness and density) on the assemblages of herbivorous insects and spiders along a gradient of secondary forest succession in a semiarid Caatinga in northeastern Brazil. Insect and spiders were collected by beating the foliage during dry and wet seasons in 2010 and 2011. Plant richness and density varied significantly among stages of succession. In total, 2,590 arboreal insects were collected, corresponding to 14 orders and 151 morphospecies. In addition, we sampled 896 canopy spiders, encompassing 14 families and 53 morphospecies. Insect richness and abundance were negatively related with habitat structure, while spider richness increases with tree richness. We did not find any relationship among insects and spiders but there were differences in species composition of insects among all successional stages, determined by changes in vegetation structure. However, this effect does not extend to the species composition of spiders that remain similar in the different stages of secondary succession. We conclude that habitat structure had a partial bottom-up effect on arboreal insects and spider assemblages, indicating that this factor regulates the richness, abundance and species composition of arboreal insets and species richness of spiders. Thus, habitat structure promotes the maintenance of insects and spider diversity in fragments of Caatinga. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - In Brazil, the remaining areas of Atlantic Forest are intensely fragmented. The connection of forest fragments through ecological corridors is an important step in biodiversity conservation. Certain areas are more resilient, and in those areas, natural forest regeneration, for example, can be encouraged. The aim of this study was to identify areas of greater resilience in order to support the connection of Atlantic Forest fragments with ecological corridors. Forest fragments in the municipality of Paraíba do Sul, in the state of Rio de Janeiro, were mapped using the supervised maximum likelihood classification of an Operational Land Imager (OLI)/Landsat-8 sensor image. Next, we analyzed the influence of terrain attributes (aspect, incident solar radiation, slope, and curvature profile) on natural regeneration. The areas with the greatest potential to achieve natural regeneration and to form ecological corridors were indicated through fuzzy membership functions. Within Paraíba do Sul, 31% of the territory is covered by vegetation in different stages of regeneration. Recordings were made of 1,251 forest fragments in a middle or advanced stage of regeneration. These fragments are usually situated in the southeast, south, and southwest aspects, in areas that receive the least amount of global solar radiation (Wh·m-2) per year, and on slopes with an angle of inclination greater than 20%. The adjustment of fuzzy functions identified 17,327.5 ha with a tendency to recover, and which are therefore strategic areas in the development of ecological corridors. © 2016, Sociedade de Investigacoes Florestais.

AB  - The objective of this research was to analyze the effect of extensive cattle raising on floristic composition and diversity of natural regeneration in permanent preservation areas of Ombrophilous Mixed Forest in the municipality of Caçador, Santa Catarina state, Brazil. Data were collected in 32 temporary fixed area plots (4×17 m) distributed randomly in permanent preservation areas. We measured the collar diameter (10 cm) and total height of all individuals taller than 30 cm, with circumference at breast height smaller than or equal to 15.7 cm (diameter ≤ 5 cm). The floristic analysis showed 61 species, 52 genera and 30 botanical families. The areas without cattle presented diversity slightly higher than the areas with cattle. In general, the floristic composition, diversity and equability between areas with and without cattle were similar.

AB  - Processes driving the assembly of swamp forest communities have been poorly explored. We analyzed natural regeneration and adult tree communities data of a swamp gallery forest in Central Brazil to discuss the role of ecological filters in shaping plant species turnover in a successional gradient. Species data of 120 plots were used to assess species turnover between natural regeneration and adult tree communities. Our analyses were based on 4995 individuals belonging to 72 species. Community patterns were discerned using ordination analyses. A clear floristic turnover among plant life stages was distinguished. Regeneration community of swamp forests was richer in species composition than the adult community. Tree species commonly found in nonflooded gallery forests were present in the regeneration plots but not in the adult community. Differences in the floristic composition of these two strata suggest that not all species in the seedling stage can stand permanent flooding conditions and only a few tolerant species survive to become adult trees. We propose that natural disturbances play an important role by altering limiting resources, allowing seeds of nonflooded forest species to germinate. This paper elucidates the turnover between plant life stages in swamp forests and suggests mechanisms that may shape these communities. © 2015 Clarissa G. Fontes et al.

AB  - Growth of secondary forest (capoeira) is an important factor in absorption of carbon from the atmosphere. Estimates of this absorption vary greatly, in large part due to the effect of different land-use histories on the estimates available in the literature. We relate land-use history to aboveground biomass accumulation of secondary vegetation in plots on land that had been used for agriculture (unmechanized manioc and maize) and for pasture in small rural properties in the Tarumã-Mirim settlement near Manaus in central Amazonia, Brazil. We evaluated influence of (a) age of the second growth vegetation, (b) time of use as agriculture or pasture and (c) number of times the area was burned. Biomass data were obtained by destructive sampling of all plants with diameter at breast height >1. cm in 24 parcels of secondary vegetation ranging from 1 to 15. years of age in abandoned pasture (n= 9) and agriculture (n= 15). As compared to secondary vegetation in abandoned agricultural fields, vegetation in abandoned cattle pasture (the predominant use history for Amazonian secondary vegetation) grows 38% more slowly to age 6. years. Number of burns also negatively affects biomass recovery. Applying the growth rates we measured to the secondary forests reported in Brazil's Second National Communication to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change suggests that carbon uptake by this vegetation is overestimated by a factor of four in the report. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This study discusses the population structure and management potential of Brazil nut in two Amazonian regions (Acre and Amapá). We surveyed density, diameter distribution, and canopy variables. Diameter of 1.3m soil (DAP), crown form and position, presence of vines and reproductive status were evaluated for each Brazil nut tree (dbh ≥ 10 cm) in 9 ha permanent plots. In each State, we surveyed six plots, totaling 108 ha. The density and distribution of individuals in diameter class were determined by region and within each region (sites). In total, 610 Brazil nut trees were mapped: 124 in Alto Acre and 486 in Alto Cajari. In Alto Cajari Brazil nut tree density was four times higher than in Alto Acre. Alto Cajari had Brazil nut trees with better features for fruit production as crown form and position, as well as lower incidence of vines in the crowns. In terms of population structure, Sororoca had recent problems with Brazil nut trees regeneration or change of natural regeneration dynamics over time, perhaps because it is an area of savanna-forest transition. Both regions (Alto Acre e Alto Cajari) showed Brazil nut stands with a good potential for management. However, there were specific needs for silvicultural treatments. Sororoca (AP) needs to improve recruitment of new Brazil nut trees and Filipinas (AC) is in need of vine cutting.

AB  - This paper records the first report of Megastigmus transvaalensis Hussey (Hymenoptera: Torymidae) in Brazilian peppertree, Schinus terebinthifolius Raddi (Anacardiaceae) drupes in Sorocaba, state of São Paulo, Brazil. This wasp is an invasive species and was found damaging S. terebinthifolius drupes in urban areas (35.0±15.8%), natural forests (21.5±10.2%) and restoration areas (15.8±8.4%). The bioecology and damage caused by M. transvaalensis in the S. terebinthifolius drupes warrants further study focused upon the management of this phytophagous wasp. Megastigmus transvaalensis has a potential to be disseminated throughout Brazil and is posing a threat to the natural regeneration of S. terebinthifolius in the native forests and restoration areas and ecological regions of this country. © 2015 Academia Brasileira de Ciencias.

AB  - Given rates of deforestation, disturbance, and secondary forest accumulation in tropical rainforests, there is a great need to quantify habitat use and movement among different habitats. This need is particularly pronounced for animals most sensitive to disturbance, such as insectivorous understory birds. Here we use multistate capture-recapture models with radiotelemetry data to determine the successional stage at which within-day movement probabilities of Amazonian birds in secondary forest are similar to those in primary forest. We radio-tracked three common understory insectivore species in primary and secondary forest at the Biological Dynamics of Forest Fragments project near Manaus, Brazil: two woodcreepers, Glyphorynchus spirurus (n=19) and Xiphorhynchus pardalotus (n=18), and the terrestrial antthrush Formicarius colma (n=19). Forest age was a strong predictor of fidelity to a given habitat. All three species showed greater fidelity to primary forest than to 8-14-year-old secondary forest, indicating the latter's relatively poor quality. The two woodcreeper species used 12-18-year-old secondary forest in a manner comparable to continuous forest, but F. colma avoided moving even to 27-31-year-old secondary forest-the oldest at our site. Our results suggest that managers concerned with less sensitive species can assume that forest reserves connected by 12-18-year-old secondary forest corridors are effectively connected. On the other hand, >30. years are required after land abandonment before secondary forest serves as a primary forest-like conduit for movement by F. colma; more sensitive terrestrial insectivores may take longer still. © 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - We aimed to characterize the floristic and structural composition of the tree component of an area contaminated by Hovenia dulcis Thunb., to determine the relationship of the distribution of the invasive species to the successional stage, and to verify the relationship between the presence of invasive species with patterns of diversity and community structure. The study was conducted in a riparian area of the water reservoir of Machadinho Hydreletric power plant, in SC state. The survey was conducted in 48 plots of 200 m2 each, arranged in eight block. Within plots, all trees with circumference at breast height (cbh) greater or equal to 15.7 cm were measured (cbh) and identified. The data were analyzed through the phytosociological descriptors, the biological invasion index (BII), diversity index, non-metric multidimensional scalling, permutational multivariate analysis of variance, analysis of indicator species, and the c-score index. A total of 66 species was sampled, with the highest relative importance value (IV) for Ocotea puberula (Rich.) Nees (10.79%). H. dulcis ranked in seventh position of IV (4.04%) and the BII was 0.47. The blocks were classified into intermediate and advanced successional groups, with floristic and structural differences (p = 0.001) between them. H. dulcis was associated with areas with an earlier successional stage, with lower diversity and a community with no structure, in relation to segregation of species within plots. We conclude that the invasion by H. dulcis did not occur homogeneously in the area, being influenced by ecological characteristics of the resident community. © 2015, Sociedade de Investigacoes Florestais.

AB  - Understanding how animals move in a complex habitat mosaic is critical to biodiversity conservation as deforested lands and secondary rainforests accumulate in landscapes previously dominated by primary forests. To visualize the spatiotemporal dynamics of secondary forest recovery after pasture abandonment, we formed a conceptual model predicting avian space use during a temporal sequence beginning with deforestation and continuing through regrowth of old secondary forest. We tested five predictions of the model at the Biological Dynamics of Forest Fragments Project near Manaus, Brazil, using 73 radio-tagged understory insectivores of three species: two woodcreepers (Glyphorynchus spirurus, Xiphorhynchus pardalotus) and a terrestrial antthrush (Formicarius colma). Both woodcreepers provided evidence to support all predictions except that of greater path tortuosity in primary forest. Woodcreepers using secondary forest had larger home ranges, larger core areas, and faster movement rates than in primary forest. Further, the proportion of all species' core areas in primary forest exceeded the proportion of home ranges in primary forest. Formicarius colma showed a fundamentally different pattern than the woodcreepers: it essentially avoided secondary forest until 27-31 years after pasture abandonment, at which point movements were indistinguishable from those in primary forest. Formicarius colma and other terrestrial insectivores show implastic spatiotemporal responses to recovering secondary growth, which we suspect contributes to the sensitivity of this guild to forest disturbance. Quantifying the value of marginal (and economically inconsequential) habitats such as secondary forest will be essential as land managers strive to maintain species persistence and connectivity in increasingly heterogeneous tropical landscapes. © 2015.

AB  - In tropical regions, where plantanimal interactions are widespread, the effectiveness of environmental restoration techniques is dependent on the animal species present and available for fruit and seed dispersal. Therefore, monitoring the local fauna can be a good indicator of the forest regeneration process. Our goal in this study was to verify whether areas reforested by different regeneration methods in Morro da Vargem, municipality of Ibiraçu in the state of Espírito Santo, southeastern Brazil, present differences in bat species richness and composition, and in bat trophic guild number. We carried out 29 capture nights, between July 2006 and July 2007, being 6 nights in the Mata area (a pristine forest fragment), 6 nights in the Camará area (regeneration with some level of human intervention), 8 nights in the Bosque area (regeneration with some level of human intervention), and 9 nights in the Capoeira area (natural regeneration). We obtained 564 captures with 26 species. The estimated richness was greater in Bosque and Camará areas than in Capoeira and Mata. We found no differences between areas regarding species composition and trophic guilds. The lower species richness in the Mata area can be explained by its location, on a hilltop. On the other hand, the exotic plant species found in the Bosque area may provide resources year round. The large home range of bat species and the proximity of the studied areas could explain the species composition and trophic guild similarity between the areas. © SAREM, 2014.

AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the spatiotemporal variation in richness, abundance, structure and composition of phyllostomid bats over a successional gradient in a tropical dry forest in south-eastern Brazil. Four successional stages (pasture, early, intermediate and late) were sampled in the northern part of the state of Minas Gerais. Bats were sampled using mist nets at three sites for each of the four successional stages (12 sites in total) during eight periods between 2007 and 2009. A total of 537 individuals were captured (29 recaptured), distributed among four families and 22 species. Bat abundance and richness varied in space, being higher in the late-successional stage, and over time, being significantly lower during the dry season. When compared between guilds, only the abundance of omnivores varied significantly during the sampled months. Our results demonstrate that areas of late-successional stages showed higher bat richness and abundance in comparison with areas undergoing secondary succession. Our results also suggest the use of early-successional areas as flying routes by bats can lead to failure to detect differences in bat composition within successional gradients. We suggest future studies should assimilate landscape-level analyses into their studies to better evaluate the effects of successional gradients on bat assemblages.

AB  - The contribution of working forests to tropical conservation and development depends upon the maintenance of ecological integrity under ongoing land use. Assessment of ecological integrity requires an understanding of the structure, composition, and function and major drivers that govern their variability. Working forests in tropical river fl oodplains provide many goods and services, yet the data on the ecological processes that sustain these services is scant. In fl ooded forests of riverside Amazonian communities, we established 46 0.1-ha plots varying in fl ood duration, use by cattle and water buffalo, and time since agricultural abandonment (30-90 yr). We monitored three aspects of ecological integrity (stand structure, species composition, and dynamics of trees and seedlings) to evaluate the impacts of different trajectories of livestock activity (alleviation, stasis, and intensifi cation) over nine years. Negative effects of livestock intensifi cation were solely evident in the forest understory, and plots alleviated from past heavy disturbance increased in seedling density but had higher abundance of thorny species than plots maintaining low activity. Stand structure, dynamics, and tree species composition were strongly Influenced by the natural pulse of seasonal fl oods, such that the defi ning characteristics of integrity were dependent upon fl ood duration (3-200 d). Forests with prolonged fl oods ≥140 d had not only lower species richness but also lower rates of recruitment and species turnover relative to forests with short fl oods <70 d. Overall, the combined effects of livestock intensifi cation and prolonged fl ooding hindered forest regeneration, but overall forest integrity was largely related to the hydrological regime and age. Given this disjunction between factors mediating canopy and understory integrity, we present a subset of metrics for regeneration and recruitment to distinguish forest condition by livestock trajectory. Although our study design includes confounded factors that preclude a defi nitive assessment of the major drivers of ecological change, we provide much-needed data on the regrowth of a critical but poorly studied ecosystem. In addition to its emphasis on the dynamics of tropical wetland forests undergoing anthropogenic and environmental change, our case study is an important example for how to assess of ecological integrity in working forests of tropical ecosystems. © 2016 by the Ecological Society of America.

AB  - Studies related to plant morphology with native forest species have been expanded in recentyears, given their importance in the taxonomic aspects or for being useful in identifying fruits, seeds, plantules and seedlings in seed testing laboratories, in nurseries to produce seedlings, or in studies that assess the natural regeneration in forest ecosystems. However, given the great diversity of species, it is still not possible to find enough information to support such studies nor collections in herbarium for a large number of native species. This work was carried out to characterize the morphology of fruits, seeds, plantules and seedlings of Brazil wood (Caesalpinia echinata Lam) – Fabaceae, Subfamily Caesalpinioideae). Initially assessments of morphometric and internal and external morphological characteristics of fruits and seeds were performed. Then, there were descriptions of early development of plantules and seedlings. Considering the descriptive analyzes of the studied species, information about fruits, seeds, plantules and seedlings can be safely employed in efforts to identify the species, both in laboratories and nurseries or in field studies on the ecology of this species. Special attention can be given to dry fruit, and the embryo, the epigeal phanerocotylar germinationand the presence of aculei in the young stages (plantules and seedlings) are important for species identification. The characters that are common to other species of Fabaceae, Subfamily Caesalpinioideae corroborate the taxonomic importance of morphological characters. © 2015, Sociedade de Investigacoes Florestais.

AB  - In northeastern Brazil, areas converted for pasture and agriculture are often abandoned; therefore the recovered areas contain vegetation at different successional stages. The aim of this study was to characterize the diversity and structure of Caatinga vegetation areas with different histories of use in northeastern Brazil. Two areas were used: 1) preserved with no historical evidence of deforestation for agricultural purposes; and 2) regenerated after cultivation of Opuntia ficus-indica Mill., approximately 30 years ago. In each area, vegetation of 12 plots was collected, considering all individuals with circumference at 1.30 m above ground level (CAP) ≥ 6.0 cm. Collected species were classified according to dispersal strategy into the categories of anemochoric, zoochoric, and autochoric. For the analysis of α diversity, species richness, Shannon index, Pielou's evenness, and Simpson's index were used. β diversity was evaluated using hierarchical cluster analysis. Structural analysis using density, basal area, and value of importance (VI) was conducted. A comparison between the diameter distributions of the areas was performed using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Indicator species analysis (ISA) was conducted to identify the species preferences per area. The relationship of β diversity with the differences in the composition of species and their densities were analyzed with TWINSPAN. The two areas showed significant differences (p < 0.05) in richness, density, and basal area. There was no significant difference in diversity. Cluster analysis indicated the formation of two floristic groups (40% dissimilarity), which was corroborated by TWINSPAN and ISA. The regenerating area after 30 years of abandonment showed similar species diversity as did the preserved area; however, floristic composition, species richness, density, and basal area did not recover. The similarity in diameter distributions between areas indicated that the abandoned area is recovering its regenerative capability.

AB  - Abandoned pastures are increasingly targeted for forest restoration in the neotropics. However, the dominance of such areas by fodder grasses imposes a challenge for efficient and low cost control. Therefore, we questioned whether alien and native grasses equally affect: (1) natural regeneration; (2) natural regeneration under artificial perches; and (3) planted seedling development. Our study was carried out in an abandoned pasture in southeastern Brazil, in the Atlantic Forest biome. For (1) we installed plots in grass patches of Melinis minutiflora (molasse grass, an alien grass) and Imperata brasiliensis (satintail, a native grass that occurs in degraded areas); for (2) we installed plots under perches in alien and native grass patches; and for (3) we compared overall planted seedling mortality and development of four tree species in alien and native grass patches. Density and diversity of woody species in natural regeneration and under perches were similar for invasive and native grass patches. However, species composition differed between alien and native grass patches (Ellenberg similarity of 28% for perches and 35% for natural regeneration in different grass patches). Seedling mortality was similar for both alien and native grasses. Except for two tree species, development was similar for both native and alien grass patches. Our results indicate that the biological barriers imposed by a given grass species for forest succession and restoration must not be estimated based only on the species’ origin. © Ricardo Gomes César, Ricardo Augusto Gorne Viani, Milena Candido da Silva and Pedro Henrique Santin Brancalion.

AB  - Little is known about the potential of restoration plantations to provide appropriate understory conditions to support the establishment of seeds arriving from neighboring native forests. In this article, we investigated how seedling establishment is affected in the understory of restoration sites of different ages and assessed some of the potential environmental factors controlling this ecological process. We first compared the density and richness of native tree seedlings among 10-, 22-, and 55-year-old restoration plantations within the Atlantic Forest region of southeastern Brazil. Then, we undertook a seed addition experiment in each study site, during the wet season, and compared seedling emergence, survival, and biomass on local versus old-growth forest soil (transferred from a reference ecosystem), in order to test whether local substrate could hamper seedling establishment. As expected, the oldest restoration site had higher density and richness of spontaneously regenerating seedlings. However, seedling establishment was less successful both in the oldest restoration planting and using substrate transferred from a reference ecosystem, where emergence and survival were lower, but surviving seedlings grew better. We attribute these results to lower light availability for seedlings in the understory of the oldest site and speculate that higher incidence of pathogens on old-growth forest soil may have increased seedling mortality. We conclude that the understory of young restoration plantations provides suitable microsite conditions at the early establishment phases for the spontaneous regeneration or enrichment planting of native trees. © 2016 Society for Ecological Restoration.

AB  - Throughout the Amazon region, the age of forests regenerating on previously deforested land is determined, in part, by the periods of active land use prior to abandonment and the frequency of reclearance of regrowth, both of which can be quantified by comparing time-series of Landsat sensor data. Using these time-series of near annual data from 1973-2011 for an area north of Manaus (in Amazonas state), from 1984-2010 for south of Santarém (Pará state) and 1984-2011 near Machadinho d'Oeste (Rondônia state), the changes in the area of primary forest, non-forest and secondary forest were documented from which the age of regenerating forests, periods of active land use and the frequency of forest reclearance were derived. At Manaus, and at the end of the time-series, over 50% of regenerating forests were older than 16 years, whilst at Santarém and Machadinho d'Oeste, 57% and 41% of forests respectively were aged 6-15 years, with the remainder being mostly younger forests. These differences were attributed to the time since deforestation commenced but also the greater frequencies of reclearance of forests at the latter two sites with short periods of use in the intervening periods. The majority of clearance for agriculture was also found outside of protected areas. The study suggested that a) the history of clearance and land use should be taken into account when protecting deforested land for the purpose of restoring both tree species diversity and biomass through natural regeneration and b) a greater proportion of the forested landscape should be placed under protection, including areas of regrowth. © 2014 Carreiras et al.

AB  - This research aimed to evaluate the floristic composition, phytosociology and species diversity of the regenerating woody stratum of a small fragment (0.5 ha) of Semideciduous Forest, after 10 years of abandonment, in the municipality of Juiz de Fora, MG, Brazil. All woody individuals (height ≥ 1 m dbh <5 cm) were sampled at 25 random plots of 5 x 5 m. We sampled 1224 individuals belonging to 40 species. There was a strong predominance (> 90%) of species of early successional stages (pioneer and early secondary). Reflecting the strong observed ecological dominance, exercised primarily by the high density of the species Dalbergia nigra and Siparuna guianensis, species diversity value (Shannon index H '= 2.38) was much lower than the values found for mature forest fragments in this region. Although a small fragment, isolated and in early stages of secondary succession, the multivariate analysis (cluster and DCA) revealed the formation of distinct floristic groups and a strong differentiation in the arrangement of the species, showing the tropical forests typical heterogeneity. Although it has a low diversity, this urban fragment has ecological and social importance to the region, that present lack of green areas to conserve the native flora.

AB  - The present study aimed to evaluate the evolution of the restoration of degraded areas, in full protection conservation unit in the Atlantic Forest biome, in southern Brazil. The evaluated attributes were floristic composition and structure of vegetation and soil enzymatic activity (amidase, urease, phosphatase and arylsulfatase), involved in ecological processes, able to characterize different areas in restoration. The vegetation of the upper stratum was sampled in 18 plots of 10 x 20 m, in two recovered areas (A1 and A2), and in 12 plots in a forest area used as reference (AR). In these plots, the tree-shrub component was measured as for the diameter, height and canopy coverage of individuals and natural regeneration was studied in subplots, through the obtention of the root collar diameter and height. The enzyme activity was measured through the collection of 10 soil samples, in layers ranging from 0 to 5 cm and 5 to 20 cm in each area. The results showed that the areas in restoration presented lower diversity (H' = 2.31) when compared to the reference area (H' = 3.00), as well as lowest basal area, height and density. It is concluded that the enzyme activity is a good indicator for the development in both areas restored, which compared to the reference area, will occur in the long term, indicating the need for management of A1 and A2, by eliminating grasses and exotic tree species, the determining factor for the success of the restoration. © 2014, Sociedade de Investigacoes Florestais.

AB  - The site of Morro Grande, situated in the Araruama region, southeastern Brazil (22o47′07″S, 42o21′49″W), is in the Atlantic rainforest phytogeographical domain. It is attributed to proto-Tupinambá agriculturalist and ceramicist populations, recognized by their typical polychrome ceramics. Four periods of occupation were identified at this site: (1) 3,220-2,840 cal b.p.; (2) 3,000-2,150 cal b.p.; (3) 1,820-1,390 cal b.p.; and (4) c. 750 cal. b.p. Analysis of 3,908 charcoal fragments from the three earlier periods has allowed the identification of 78 taxa and 29 plant families. This work demonstrates the permanence of the Atlantic rainforest in the region between 3,220 and 1,390 cal b.p., confirming previous palaeoenvironmental studies in southeastern and southern Brazil. The existence of mature forests is demonstrated; however, firewood was collected mainly from secondary vegetation, probably in the area surrounding the settlement or from cultivated land. These results provide further evidence of human influence on Neotropical rainforests. Creation of secondary environments, however, did not result in irreversible damage to local biodiversity, since the forest tended to regenerate after the clearings were abandoned. Analysis of charcoal concentrated in features allowed the identification of ritual funerary hearths, as well as of a probable specialized feature for firing ceramics. This evidence affords new perspectives for the archaeological interpretation of the funerary ritual and way of life of proto-Tupinambá people. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - The present study reconstructs the paleovegetation of a varzea (seasonally flooded) forest in the central parts of the Madeira River floodplain in Brazil using palynological data. Forty-nine cut-bank sediment samples from the Madeira River were processed in the study; from these, ten samples contained pollen: two contained pollen from the Middle Pleniglacial age, one contained pollen from the Tardiglacial age, six contained pollen from the Holocene, and one contained more recently deposited pollen. The Middle Pleniglacial pollen belonged to a primary succession varzea forest, while the Tardiglacial pollen represented a late succession varzea forest. On the other hand, the three Holocene samples showed the characteristic composition of chavascal (water-logged forest) or lacustrine varzea forest, and three samples belonged to a late succession varzea forest. The most recent pollen deposit represented a secondary succession varzea forest. This paleovegetation showed a typical mosaic distribution, which may be explained by the fluvial dynamics, high species richness and diversity in the varzea forest, and the presence of dominant species. © 2015, Sociedade Botanica do Brasil.

AB  - The objective of this study was to quantify and compare the accumulated litter at a forest restoration (FR) for 23 years with a primary Tropical Rain Forest (FP). Thirty permanent plots of 3 x 3 m were placed in each area. In the center of each plot the litter (0,50 x 0,50 x 0,05 m) was collected. The material was dried at 70 °C for 48 hours and the dry mass was measured. The matrix of Pearson correlation between the values of accumulated litter and environmental variables plant area index (PAI), soil compaction and density of shrub and tree individuals of natural regeneration layer were calculated. The mean values found (FR = 3,177 ± 937 kg.ha-1; FP = 4,411 ± 1,389 kg.ha-1) of accumulated litter showed significant difference between the two study areas (p <0.001). The accumulated litter showed significant correlation (p <0.001) with soil compaction and plant area index. © 2016, Sociedade de Investigacoes Florestais. All rights reserved.

AB  - The most characteristic forest type of southern Brazil is the Araucaria Forest, strongly marked by the presence of the species Araucaria angustifolia. However, the overexploitation of the species reduced its range to 2% of its original area. Efforts must be made to support and promote its natural regeneration, seeking the preservation and sustainable use of its economic resources. Therefore, an experiment was conducted to evaluate germination, survival and predation rates of seeds and seedlings of Araucaria angustifolia, analyzed as a randomized factorial design with two factors with two levels each (type of plantation: pure/mixed; raw material: seeds/seedlings), totaling four treatments, with three replicates each. Fourteen months after planting only 17% of the seed holes contained live plants; 14% of planted seedlings survived; 60% of the seeds were consumed by animals. Seedling survival was 41.1% in the “pure” treatment and 20% in the mixed treatment. In the mixed treatment, seed losses due to fauna attack were lower (42.2%) compared to the ‘pure’ treatment (68.9%); the opposite behavior was observed in the case of seedlings. © 2016, Universidade Federal de Santa Maria.

AB  - Soil features are an important factor influencing plant growth and distribution in different parts of the tropics. We hypothesized that in forests recovering from a disturbance, the spatial and temporal variation of soil proprieties could determine differences in forest structure and composition. We addressed this question by comparatively assessing the soil traits and forest structure and diversity that occur in two contrasting soils in second growth tropical forests of southern Brazil: Cambisols (well-drained and nutrient-poor soil) and Gleisols (periodically flooded and with greater soil Al toxicity). Three replicates of four combinations of four forest ages (9-11, 15-20, 40-55, and >100. years since abandonment) and two soil types (Cambisol and Gleisol) were compared, thus encompassing 21 plots that covered 2.1. ha. A total of 3355 individuals of 151 tree species were sampled in all plots. Soil characteristics changed along the succession, with Al toxicity increasing as the forests aged. Cambisols and Gleisols differed in their nutritional and structural characteristics. Forests growing in both soil types exhibited higher species density, individual density and basal area along the successional gradient, but diversity (and evenness) was higher in forests growing in Gleisol soils. Moreover, soil characteristics (sand:clay, C:N, and Al and P concentrations) and forest age determined the differences in community assemblies among soils. Considering that soil characteristics are spatially and temporally variable in the tropics and that these variations are poorly measured in successional studies, we argue that small-scale variations in soil characteristics can potentially be a powerful factor influencing the successional trajectories of second growth tropical forests in tropical regions. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Seed banks play an important role in the resilience of potential anthropogenic areas and are influenced by seasonal variation. The spatial and temporal heterogeneity of the forests influences the richness and density of the soil seed bank, but there is a hypothesis that such influence can be changed in anthropogenic areas, where we expect to find lower richness and seed density in relation to the seed bank of mature forests. The richness and seasonal density of seeds in the soil depth of a young caatinga forest, 17 years after an agricultural activity was abandoned, were evaluated and compared with those of a mature forest. The study was conducted at the Instituto Agronômico de Pernambuco - IPA (Estação Experimental José Nilson de Melo), located in Caruaru, Pernambuco, Brazil, in an area of tropical dry forest, known locally as “caatinga”. The local climate is seasonal, the dry season occurring from September to February and the rainy season concentrated in the remaining months. The average annual rainfall over time (time series of 30 years) is 692mm. In each climatic season (rainy and dry), the seed bank was sampled in 210 20x20cm plots (105 in the leaf litter and 105 at 5cm soil depth). The richness and seed density of the soil samples were evaluated by the method of seedling emergence. The seed bank had 47 species, with a predominance of herbaceous plants. Seasonal variation in richness and seed density in the soil (leaf litter + soil) was not significant, but 42 species of the mature forest were absent from the seed bank of the young forest, despite 17 years of natural regeneration and its proximity to the mature forest. On its own, the soil has greater richness and density of seeds than the leaf litter. The depth of seed deposition in the soil bank of the young forest significantly explained 36% of the species richness and 16% of the seed density, with a significant interaction effect with the climatic season only on species richness, explaining 4% of the variation recorded. The seed density of the young forest (1 277seeds/m2) was greater than that the mature forest indicating that the time abandoned had not yet been sufficient for complete recovery of plant diversity and there is no longer any seed limitation of pioneer species for regeneration of the young forest. © 2015, Universidad de Costa Rica.

AB  - Primary tropical rain forests are being rapidly perforated with new edges via roads, logging, and pastures, and vast areas of secondary forest accumulate following abandonment of agricultural lands. To determine how insectivorous Amazonian understory birds respond to edges between primary rain forest and three age classes of secondary forest, we radio-tracked two woodcreepers (Glyphorynchus spirurus, N = 17; Xiphorhynchus pardalotus, N = 18) and a terrestrial antthrush (Formicarius colma, N = 19). We modeled species-specific response to distance to forest edge (a continuous variable) based on observations at varying distances from the primary-secondary forest interface. All species avoided 8-14-yr-old secondary forest. Glyphorynchus spirurus and F. colma mostly remained within primary forest <100 m from the young edge. Young F. colma rarely penetrated >100 m into secondary forest 27-31 yr old. Young Formicarius colma and most G. spirurus showed a unimodal response to 8-14-yr-old secondary forest, with relative activity concentrated just inside primary forest. After land abandonment, G. spirurus was the first to recover to the point where there was no detectable edge response (after 11-14 yr), whereas X. pardalotus was intermediate (15-20 yr), and F. colma last (28-30 yr +). Given the relatively quick recovery by our woodcreeper species, new legislation on protection of secondary forests > 20-yr old in Brazil's Pará state may represent a new opportunity for conservation and management; however, secondary forest must mature to at least 30 yr before the full compliment of rain forest-dependent species can use secondary forest without adverse edge effects. © 2015 Association for Tropical Biology and Conservation Inc.

AB  - Soils of the Brazilian Cerrado biome have been found to be deficient in copper (Cu) and zinc (Zn). In this area, an Oxisol was deeply excavated in 1962 during the construction of a hydroelectrical plant, and the exposed saprolite material was abandoned, without any reclamation measures. The abandoned land was a harsh environment for plant growth, and the secondary vegetation has not recovered. A field trial was established in 1992 to assess the effects of different grass species and lime amendments on soil reclamation at the degraded site. In 2011 soil samples were collected at three depths (0–10, 10–20, and 20–40 cm) from vegetated and bare plots over tilled saprolite, from an untreated area of the saprolite, and from an Oxisol under native forest, used as external reference. Nineteen years after the reclamation effort was begun, the organic carbon (OC) content of the restored saprolite still was much lower than that of the Oxisol under natural vegetation. The undisturbed Oxisol was deficient in extractable Cu (0.16–0.10 mg kg−1) and Zn (0.10–0.02 mg kg−1) and exhibited rather low concentrations of extractable iron (Fe; 5.24–1.47 mg kg−1) and manganese (Mn; 3.21–0.77 mg kg−1). However, the saprolite under reclamation showed even lower levels of these elements compared to the native forest soil. In the natural soil, OC, N, extractable Fe, Mn, and Cu showed stratification, but this was not the case for extractable Zn. Although the reclaimed saprolite still was far from predisturbance conditions, the revegetation treatments promoted recovery of OC, N, Fe, Mn, and Cu at the surface layers, which resulted in incipient stratification. Extractable Fe, Mn, and Cu were correlated to OC, whereas no association between Zn and OC was detected. Our results also suggest that reclamation of the excavated saprolite may be constrained by micronutrient deficiencies and mostly by the extremely low levels of Zn and Cu. © , Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - In tropical forests, several reforestation programs have been created to recover biological diversity in deforested environments. However, most of these studies have focused on the loss of species and ignored the loss of ecological interactions and ecosystem services that these species provide in their natural environment. Here, we assess how reforestation (including both native and exotic species) and the distance from the forest matrix could recover the following parameters: richness, composition, and ant-plant interactions in the southern Brazilian Amazon. For this, we collected data in five different agroforestry landscapes: primary and secondary forests, reforestations of teak and fig, and pasture. In general, we observed that the distance from the forest matrix was not an important factor for the recovery of ant-plant interactions at the scale of this study. Ant-plant interactions were more specialized in the pasture, possibly due to the low richness and high dominance in pastures, which generates a high ant-plant dependency. Moreover, none of the strategies employed for the recovery of diversity (teak and fig reforestation) increased the recovery rate of the studied parameters: richness, composition, and the patterns of ant-plant interactions, when compared to primary forests. These results indicate that regardless of species richness and composition, secondary forests and reforestation lands are functionally different from pastures. In conclusion, our results represent a valuable tool to conservation planners, mainly because we show that secondary forests created by natural regeneration can be an efficient and economical method for restoring the disruption of ant-plant interactions in tropical forests. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The identification of the main sources of anthropic greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) associated with the mitigation and removal of these emissions has become an important instrument in the attenuation of the climatic changes predicted by the IPCC. The largest emission source in Brazil is forest conversion. This land use change has always had a strong relationship with the expansion of agriculture, an activity of great importance in the country, which has the largest commercial cattle herd in the planet. Following the considerable reduction in emissions from deforestation, agriculture has been since 2010 the most important source (MCTI (Ministério da Ciência, Tecnologia e Inovação), 2013. Brasília: Ministério daCiência, Tecnologia e Inovação, Brasil). Seeking to discover the possibilities of altering the emissions profile in the agricultural sector, four scenarios were developed related to how this is dealt with in the beef cattle sector, calculating the potential removal of carbon from the atmosphere through natural regeneration of biomes. The results suggest that picketing and rotation scenario has the greatest potential, with a carbon reduction of 17.7GtCO2eq, while the shared raising with grain legumes scenario has the lowest calculated reduction potential of 7.1GtCO2eq was calculated. The animal confinement scenario had an intermediary reduction potential of 8.3GtCO2eq. The mosaic of methods scenario, in which it is attempted to simulate the parallel adoption of the measures proposed in all other scenarios, had a reduction potential of 13.1GtCO2eq. In the scenarios where animal confinement occurs, the treatment of waste with biodigestion allows the generation of biogas and biofertilizers, contributing to an increase in the potential carbon reduction. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Seasonally dry tropical forests (SDTFs) have high tree species richness and endemism, whose dynamics and succession depend on natural regeneration (NR). To test whether NR is influenced by the mature stratum and environmental variables, we compared structural and floristic patterns of mature trees [Mt (DBH ≥ 5 cm)] with the NR of a SDTF on limestone outcrops in Central Brazil. Additionally, we tested for effects of environmental variables on species abundance in these different strata. Within NR categories [JuvA (total height < 100 cm) and JuvB (total height ≥ 100 cm and DBH < 5 cm)], we recorded 597 individuals in 69 angiosperm species. Within NR and Mt we recorded 110 species distributed in 33 families, and 54 were common to both (~50% of total richness). Shannon diversity was 3.83, 3.13 and 3.33 for Mt, JuvA and JuvB, respectively. Besides the high number of exclusive species recorded in Mt (23), JuvA (18) and JuvB (24), comparisons indicated high floristic similarity (51%) between strata. Mt, JuvA and JuvB were influenced by different environmental variables, indicating that species requirements change along the establishment process. This highlights the importance of environmental variability for maintaining tree species diversity in SDTFs, and the importance of this remnant for the conservation of SDTFs in Central Brazil.  © 2014 by Unisinos.

AB  - This study aimed to describe and compare the floristic composition and structure of tree and shrub vegetation, as well as identifying trends in the dynamics of species in forest fragments with different stages of regeneration. An inventory was conducted in the forest fragments, adopting the method of systematic sampling with sampling units (SUs) of fixed area, with dimensions of 20 × 10 m, distributed throughout the area. 23 SUs were allocated in the secondary forest fragment and 10 SUs in the capoeira fragment, which was held the vegetation survey three classes of inclusion: R1 (seedlings regeneration): h and ≥ 50cm DBH < 2 cm; R2 (established regeneration): DBH between 2 and 5 cm, and A (arboreal stratum): DBH ≥ 5 cm. 87 species were found belonging to 36 families. The floristic composition was similar in the arboreal stratum, showing Lithrea molleoides as the species most important in both fragments. The natural regeneration of forest was characterized by Psychotria leiocarpa and regeneration of capoeira by Myrcia oblongata. The differences observed between forests showed trends of changes in the woody component according to the natural dynamics of the species in the process of secondary succession.

AB  - The objective of this paper is to assessing on estimates of biomass in forest areas using: a direct approach, through measures in the field; and an indirect approach, through processing of remote sensing products. Two study areas were used for the direct and indirect biomass estimates for the monitoring of natural regeneration of riparian forests, on the banks of the Uruguay River, in the border between the states of Santa Catarina and Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. Results showed that the average biomass of representative class showed an increased biomass growth following the growth stage of forest. It was observed that the permanent preservation areas near the reservoirs had a significantly higher variation in the NDVI values compared to other areas not preserved nearby. Looking at the average change in NDVI values between the years of 2005 and 2012 for these land use classes, it was found an increase in the index for all classes of coverage analysis. In this scenario, when assessing the total production of biomass for these study areas, it was noted that there was a positive increase of biomass, since the forest classes showed a significant increase in their biomass and the class of grazing-a decrease. This increase can be classified as positive even with a significant decrease in average forest stage of succession, since this decrease, possibly also means an increase in forest classes in early and advanced stages of succession.

AB  - This study evaluated the process of restoration in a degraded Permanent Preservation Area (PPA) in the municipality of Pouso Redondo, Santa Catarina state, six years after the initial plantation of trees and isolation of the area. Tree species were surveyed and increment of richness by natural establishment was quantified. Syndromes of propagule dispersion and regeneration guilds were determined. A total of 918 individuals from 73 species were found; 48 (65.8%) of them were species naturally established in the area. 71.2% of the species were classified as zoochoric (71.2%), and 54.8% as light demanding for climax. After six years, the restoration process was characterized by a trend of richness increment and replacement of initial by late successional species, indicating the relevance of the natural regeneration mechanism.

AB  - Non-native tree plantations represent 7% of the world’s forests and 1.24% of the Brazilian vegetation. Planted areas are expected to increase in the near future; thus, it is important to systematize existing knowledge on the ecological effects of plantations to aid forest management and biodiversity conservation. Here, we conducted a systematic review of the ecological literature associated with planted Pinus and Eucalyptus species in Brazil. We compared publication metrics with geographical distribution of species, ecosystems, biomes, studied taxa, and ecological impacts. We found 152 publications from 1992 to 2012. Number of publications positively correlated with area planted, number of plantations with forest certification, number of researchers, and richness of studied kingdoms. Most studies were in terrestrial ecosystems (92.1%), the Atlantic Forest biome (55.3%), and the kingdom Animalia (68.2%). Most impacts of non-native tree plantations were negative (55.9%), followed by positive (27%), and mixed (17.1%). Negative impacts were declines in species richness and abundance, seed bank diversity, and natural regeneration. Positive impacts were increase or mainteinance of seed bank diversity and natural regeneration. Mixed impacts were increases in abundance of native tree plantation pests. Taken together, results suggest forest management can help maintain biodiversity if it considers previous environmental conditions and integrates plantations with surrounding habitats. © 2016, Academia Brasileira de Ciencias.

AB  - Exotic species are used to trigger facilitation in restoration plantings, but this positive effect may not be permanent and these species may have negative effects later on. Since such species can provide a marketable product (firewood), their harvest may represent an advantageous strategy to achieve both ecological and economic benefits. In this study, we looked at the effect of removal of a non-native tree species (Mimosa caesalpiniifolia) on the understory of a semideciduous forest undergoing restoration. We assessed two 14-year-old plantation systems (modified “taungya” agroforestry system; and mixed plantation using commercial timber and firewood tree species) established at two sites with contrasting soil properties in São Paulo state, Brazil. The experimental design included randomized blocks with split plots. The natural regeneration of woody species (height ≥0.2 m) was compared between managed (all M. caesalpiniifolia trees removed) and unmanaged plots during the first year after the intervention. The removal of M. caesalpiniifolia increased species diversity but decreased stand basal area. Nevertheless, the basal area loss was recovered after 1 year. The management treatment affected tree species regeneration differently between species groups. The results of this study suggest that removal of M. caesalpiniifolia benefited the understory and possibly accelerated the succession process. Further monitoring studies are needed to evaluate the longer term effects on stand structure and composition. The lack of negative effects of tree removal on the natural regeneration indicates that such interventions can be recommended, especially considering the expectations of economic revenues from tree harvesting in restoration plantings. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - This study aimed to identify natural regeneration in dense ombrophilous phytophysiognomy of the State Forest of Amapá, describing relations between vertical stratums. The study area is located in Porto Grande/AP, eastern Amazon. Three conglomerates were implanted, equidistant at 2.500 m, for natural regeneration estimative. We used 100 plots of 10 x 10 m for study of saplings (5.0 < DBH (diameter at 1.30 m soil) < 10.0 cm) and sticks (5 x 5 m) (2.5 < DBH <5.0 cm) in each conclomerate. We collected the heights and popular names. The heights were divided into three classes of regeneration to estimate phytosociological parameters of frequency and density, as well as regeneration by size class and overall. Diversity was estimated by Shannon Index. Floristic similarity between sticks and saplings was also analyzed. The inventory included 2,700 individuals belonging to 38 botanical families, 93 genera and 141 species of trees, with 6 undetermined. The Shannon index was 4.21 (saplings) and 4.11 nats.ind.-1 (sticks). It has been found the occurrence of 33 common species in three classes of regeneration. The total natural regeneration varied from 10.3 to 0.1% (sticks) and 5.6 to 0.1% (saplings). The species with the lowest percentages were Indeterminate, Vouacapoua americana, Carapa guianensis, Virola calophylla and Manilkara huberi. Thus, it is evident that species are developing their successional process efficiently, ensuring conservation of phytophysiognomy in the region. © 2014, Sociedade de Investigacoes Florestais.

AB  - This study was conducted in a forest under restoration process, which belongs to the company Holcim Brasil S/A, in the municipality of Barroso, state of Minas Gerais (21º00’to 22º00’S and 43º00’ to 44º00’W), where 40 plots (2 x 2 m) were set, spaced at 10 m, forming eight strata parallel to the watercourse present in the area. Floristic composition and natural regeneration stratum were characterized, and the formed strata allowed evaluating whether the riparian vegetation and watercourse influence on the local regeneration. It was found 162 individuals of 13 families, 18 genera and 22 species, and 10,125 individuals/ha were estimated. Successional classes from pioneer and early secondary and zoochory dispersion syndrome prevailed among species and individuals. The watercourse and riparian vegetation did not exercise significant influence (p> 0.05) on the number of species and regenerating individuals among the different strata of the forest. The diversity index of Shannon-Wiener (H’) and equability of Pielou (J’) were 2.691 and 0.870, respectively. The species Psidium guajava and Myrtaceae families presented the highest VI (value of importance). Natural regeneration analysis showed the low floristic diversity in the area, suggesting that corrective management actions should be adopted. © 2016, Sociedade de Investigacoes Florestais.

AB  - Introduction: Land use intensification and urbanisation processes are degrading hydrological ecosystem services in the Guapi-Macacu watershed of Rio de Janeiro. A proposal to pay farmers to restore natural watershed services might be an alternative to securing the water supply in the long-term for the around 2.5 million urban water users in the study region. This study quantifies the costs of changing current land use patterns to enhance watershed services and compares these costs to the avoided costs associated with water treatment for public supply.; Methods: We use farm-household data to estimate the opportunity costs of abandoning current land uses for the recovery of natural vegetation; a process that is very likely to improve water quality in terms of turbidity due to reduced inputs from erosion. Opportunity cost estimates are extrapolated to the watershed scale based on remote sensing land use classifications and vulnerability analysis to identify priority zones for watershed management interventions. To assess the potential demand for watershed services, we analyse water quality and treatment cost data from the main local water treatment plant.; Results: Changing agricultural land uses for watershed services provision generally comes at high opportunity costs in our study area near to the metropolis of Rio de Janeiro. Alternative low cost watershed conservation options do exist in the livestock production sector. These options have the potential to directly reduce the amount of sediments and nutrients reaching the water bodies, and in turn decrease the costs of treatment needed for drinking water. Land cover changes at the scale needed to improve water quality will, nonetheless, likely exceed the cost of additional investments in water treatment.; Conclusions: The state water utility company’s willingness to pay for watershed services alone will not be enough to induce provision of additional watershed services. We conclude that monetary incentives conditioned on specific adjustments to existing production systems could still have a complementary role to play in improving watershed services. However, we note that our willingness to pay analysis focusses on only one of the potentially wide range of ecosystem services provided by natural vegetation in the Guapi-Macacu watershed. Factoring these ecosystem services into the willingness to pay equation is likely to change our assessment in favour of additional conservation action, be it through PES or other policy instruments. © 2014, Rodriguez Osuna et al.; licensee Springer.

AB  - The introduction of exotic species is considered as one of the major causes of biodiversity loss. The National Forest of Carajás is one of the largest mineral provinces in the world. Mining activities caused changes of the natural habitats, leaving degraded areas after the mineral exploitation. One of the mining areas within FLONA Carajás was used for the extraction of gold. In the process of exploitation, a huge depression was formed by the removal of soil which was mounded up nearby. To prevent soil erosion of these mounds, an exotic grass, Urochloa decumbens (Stapf) R.D.Webster (Poaceae) was planted. The objective of this study was to compare the impact of this non-native grass on species richness and species composition of the natural regeneration in the degraded areas. Four areas were compared, two with and two without presence of U. decumbens. In each area, twenty four 1m²/plots were established. Species richness of the regeneration areas and population sizes were significantly lower in the plots where the exotic grass was present. Our study shows that U. decumbens had a negative effect on species richness and population density, and its presence changed the species composition and distribution of life forms of the natural regeneration. © 2016, Academia Brasileira de Ciencias.

AB  - High-resolution image segmentation and data mining techniques were used in order to find statistical correlation between spatial, spectral, context and texture attributes, considering field data from early stages of secondary forests in the three study sites of Rain Forest in Santa Catarina State, Brazil. Field data were collected in six sampling plots with 1,600 m² each. Digital processing utilized three high resolution images (0.39 m) obtained by SAAPI sensor with three visible bands, three near infrared bands, one terrain and one surface model. Extracted data from the digital product (attributes) were used for data mining purposes, selecting the ones with relevance and dismissing those of lesser weight. It was found that both tree and regeneration layers are heterogeneous considering number of individuals (N), diameter at breast height (DBH) and basal area (AB). However, significant correlations between forest attributes and field data were found. The higher correlation of N is with the average of the band 1 (-0.64), 3 (-0.62) and IR1 (0.63) for DBH was the ratio of bands IR3 (0.56) and 2 (0.55) and the variable AB was the smallest pixel value of band 1 (-0.64) and IR3 (-0.60). All correlation coefficients were highly significant (p <0.01). These results constitute the starting point for future research on the relationship between groups of variables in order to estimate biophysical parameters. © 2016, Universidade Federal do Parana.

AB  - Guadua sarcocarpa and Guadua weberbaueri (Poaceae: Bambuseae) have a negative influence on tree regeneration and recruitment in bamboo-dominated forests of southwestern Amazonia. The lack of advanced regeneration and sparse canopy in this forest type present a considerable challenge for developing sustainable timber management plans. We conducted field studies in the Porto Dias Agroextractive Settlement Project in Acre, Brazil to assess influences of logging in bamboo-dominated forest sites. Taxonomic composition, stand structure, aboveground biomass, commercial timber volume, and commercial tree seedling and bamboo culm density were compared between five logged vs. unlogged sites in different landholdings, using modified 0.5. ha Gentry plots. No differences in taxonomic composition, aboveground biomass, adult and juvenile stem density, or woody seedling and bamboo culm density were detected between paired logged and unlogged sites. Commercial timber volume, however, was reduced by almost two-thirds in logged plots, suggesting that long-term timber management goals in this forest type are compromised since so few future crop trees remained onsite. Our findings indicate that in order to maximize local management objectives, community forest managers must approach logging in bamboo-dominated forests with caution. We suggest an integration of non-timber forest product extraction with low harvest intensity and low-impact logging, tending of natural regeneration, and diversification of commercial species. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This study aimed to evaluate the species composition and structure of Seasonal Deciduous Forest in the southern Brazilian state of Santa Catarina, including the tree/shrub component and the natural regeneration. We also compared the floristic composition between the components and discussed about the conservation condition of forests. The study was based on sample plots established by the Floristic and Forest Inventory of Santa Catarina state. Tree/shrub component was sampled by 78 plots placed systematically with 4,000 m² of sample area each, were individuals with DBH (diameter at breast height) ≥ 10 cm was measured. Regeneration (DBH <10 cm and height >1.50 m) was sampled in subplots of 100 m² each. Structure and diversity of sample plots were analyzed in both components; species were classified by their ecologic group. To test the association between components was made a Non-metric Multidimensional Scaling (NMSD) and Mantel test. We sampled 245 species, among them 215 in the tree/shrub component (79 of them exclusive), 165 species in the natural regeneration (30 exclusive ones) and 136 species common to the two components. The association between components was confirmed with NMSD and Mantel test (r = 0.34; p = 0.001). Species with major importance value were mostly early secondary species that emphasizes the consequences of long term exploitation and degradation of Seasonal Deciduous Forest in Santa Catarina. © 2014 Universidade Federal de Santa Maria.

AB  - This work investigates how the integrated land use of northern South America has affected the present day regional patterns of hydrology. A model of the terrestrial ecosystems (ecosystem demography model 2: ED2) is combined with an atmospheric model (Brazilian Regional Atmospheric Modeling System: BRAMS). Two realizations of the structure and composition of terrestrial vegetation are used as the sole differences in boundary conditions that drive two simulations. One realization captures the present day vegetation condition that includes deforestation and land conversion, the other is an estimate of the potential structure and composition of the region's vegetation without human influence. Model output is assessed for differences in resulting hydrometeorology. <br><br> The simulations suggest that the history of land conversion in northern South America is not associated with a significant precipitation bias in the northern part of the continent, but has shown evidence of a negative bias in mean regional evapotranspiration and a positive bias in mean regional runoff. Also, negative anomalies in evaporation rates showed pattern similarity with areas where deforestation has occurred. In the central eastern Amazon there was an area where deforestation and abandonment had lead to an overall reduction of above-ground biomass, but this was accompanied by a shift in forest composition towards early successional functional types and grid-average-patterned increases in annual transpiration. <br><br> Anomalies in annual precipitation showed mixed evidence of consistent patterning. Two focus areas were identified where more consistent precipitation anomalies formed, one in the Brazilian state of Pará where a dipole pattern formed, and one in the Bolivian Gran Chaco, where a negative anomaly was identified. These locations were scrutinized to understand the basis of their anomalous hydrometeorologic response. In both cases, deforestation led to increased total surface albedo, driving decreases in net radiation, boundary layer moist static energy and ultimately decreased convective precipitation. In the case of the Gran Chaco, decreased precipitation was also a result of decreased advective moisture transport, indicating that differences in local hydrometeorology may manifest via teleconnections with the greater region. © Author(s) 2015.

AB  - Studies evaluating the pioneer tree species capacity to provide favorable conditions to natural regeneration in forest restoration plantings are still scarce. Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate whether pioneer tree species affect differentially the microclimate conditions of the understory in forest restoration plantations. Two forest restoration sites, with three and five years old, were selected in a semi-deciduous forest in Itu city, São Paulo State, Brazil. In each site, five individuals of five pioneer species were studied. In the three years old site, Luehea grandiflora, Schinus terebinthifolius, Solanum erianthum, Croton urucurana and Cecropia pachystachya were studied, and in the five years old site, plants of the species L. grandiflora, S. terebinthifolius, Apeiba tibourbou, C. urucurana and S. erianthum were selected. Each species was considered as a sampling unit. Tree species height and canopy cover, air relative humidity and soil and air temperature were analyzed. In the three years old restoration site no effect of species in microclimatic conditions was found. However, in the five years old restoration site, microclimatic conditions were significantly different among species. Therefore, the importance of a careful choice of pioneer tree species as ecosystem engineers which modify environmental conditions and facilitate natural regeneration in forest restoration projects was emphasized.

AB  - The plasticity of functional attributes is an important strategy for the acclimation and establishment of plants in areas that undergo natural regeneration. The irregular rainfall of the Brazilian tropical dry forest is an important environmental filter for the determination of the set of species that can successfully establish in different stages of the regeneration process and influences the plant acclimation responses to the environmental conditions at each stage of ecological succession. In order to test the hypothesis that pioneer plants which can establish themselves, at the same time, in areas at different stages of regeneration have high phenotypic plasticity, we investigated the endemic tree species Poincianella pyramidalis Tull., which can be found in all stages of the regeneration process in the Brazilian tropical dry forest. Three areas were selected at different successional stages (early, intermediate and late), and the functional attributes of water status, gas exchange, leaf nutrients, specific leaf area, leaf construction costs and payback time were assessed. In the three successional stages all individuals had similar age. Measurements were taken in April, for two consecutive years, a dry and a wet. The evaluated parameters in this study showed changes according to successional stage. The highest leaf water potential was found in the late stage in the rainy year and lowest in the dry year. This behavior may be related, in addition to soil water availability, to a stronger competition for resources in these areas. Gas exchange and nutrient use efficiency were higher in 2013 and in the late successional stage, which exhibited higher soil moisture, a lower vapor pressure deficit and higher nutrient mobilization. There were no differences in the construction cost per unit mass between the stages, but differences in specific leaf area led to changes in cost per area. The payback time was shorter in the wettest year. For the driest year, the late stage showed greater energy use efficiency. The results show that the P. pyramidalis' attributes varies according to the successional stage, showing phenotypic plasticity. However, the strongest differences are observed between years, demonstrating that water is the main factor that coordinates the functional changes that confers its ability to acclimatize. © 2015.

AB  - The applicability of succession models from temperate and tropical wet forests to threatened seasonally dry tropical forests (SDTFs) is questioned. Plant phenology affects ecosystem functions and changes along forest regeneration gradient. To investigate the recovery of ecological functions after disturbances in a SDTF, we recorded the vegetative and reproductive phenologies for trees (DBH >5 cm) for 17 months in southeast Brazil in three successional stages: early (10–15 years after clearing), intermediate (25–30) and late (>50). The vegetative phenology of the 523 individuals was strongly seasonal, with 3% of individuals presenting green leaves in a deciduous dry season. Besides structural and floristic differences, phenological trends were similar between the later stages. Reproduction occurred with higher intensities in the early stage and in the advanced stages only in the dry season, providing key resources to local fauna. The studied SDTF is resilient to ecological functions, rapidly recovering functional processes. The integration of structural and functional knowledge of succession of STDFs may lead to better management of its secondary remnants. Our study suggests that classical forest succession theory developed for other ecosystems may not fully reflect the pattern of SDTF succession, an ecosystem that originally covered 42% of the earth's tropical and subtropical landmass. © 2014, © 2014 Società Botanica Italiana.

AB  - Veredas (palm swamps) is a type of vegetation associated with watercourses, characterized by the presence of Mauritia flexuosa palm trees. These systems are not well understood and suffer from high anthropogenic pressure. The aims of this study were to describe the natural regeneration of two swamp forests in vereda systems with different anthropogenic impacts and investigate if the variation in these plant communities are associated to edaphic conditions. The study was performed in preserved and impacted sites located in the Environmental Protection Area of the Pandeiros River in northern Minas Gerais. At each site, one hundred 25 m2 plots were established for surveying regenerating shrubs and trees (≥1 cm diameter at the base of the stem and < 3 cm diameter at breast height). Vegetation structure was evaluated by phytosociological parameters, similarity index, and size distribution of individuals. Regenerating strata was correlated with chemical and physical soil analyses. The vegetation at the preserved site was characterized by a higher number of individuals and a lower diversity but contained species that were typical of flooded areas. The results also showed differences in soil nutrient availability between sites that influenced the distribution of species at the two study sites. © 2016, Federal University of Lavras.

AB  - In this study, genetic diversity, inbreeding, spatial genetic structure (SGS), and pollen dispersal are analyzed using ten microsatellite loci from two populations of the dioecious, wind-pollinated, coniferous tree Araucaria angustifolia in Southern Brazil. The study populations include an undisturbed 7 ha A. angustifolia cluster, where all adult trees were mapped and sampled, and an adjacent, long-abandoned, open agricultural area with an aggregated A. angustifolia population. Seeds were collected from 13 seed trees inside the forest cluster and from eight seed trees in the open forest. Our results showed that the adults present high levels of heterozygosity (Ho = 0.91) and an absence of inbreeding. However, significant SGS was detected up to 90 m in the forest cluster suggesting that near-neighbor trees are related. The estimate of effective population size was lower than the total number of trees in the cluster (Ne/N = 0.19), which can be explained by the presence of SGS in the stand. Substantial external pollen flow was detected in the forest cluster (26 %) and open forest (20 %), indicating that the reproductive population size is greater than the sampled populations, explaining the high genetic diversity in this population. Our results indicate that this site has potential for in and ex situ conservation due to high levels of genetic diversity and gene immigration resulting from pollen flow. Conservation strategies for A. angustifolia should focus not only on forest fragments but should also include the preservation of isolated trees throughout the landscape. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the ecological relationships between different layers of a restored area in Viçosa, State of Minas Gerais. A floristic survey of the tree layer, natural regeneration and soil seed bank was carried out. The floristic composition between layers of the restored area (tree layer, regeneration and seed bank) was compared, and this composition was also compared to various forest fragments in the area; the comparisons were made through cluster analysis. The successional class and dispersion syndrome between layers of the restored area were compared by analysis of variance (ANOVA). The dendrogram obtained distinguished the seed bank of the other layers. There was no similarity between the area studied and the forest fragments in Viçosa. In the distribution by successional class and dispersal syndrome, there was significant difference between the seed bank and other layers of the restored area. Results evinced the discrepancy of the seed bank floristic compared to other layers of the forest, proving that the forest area is in a headmost stage of succession.

AB  - The development of large urban centers in natural areas resulted in abolition and degradation of forests. In order to obtain tools for restoring programs development in such areas, this study aimed to evaluate efficiency of different nucleus techniques in relation to biotic and abiotic factors which limit natural regeneration in a depressed area of remnant forest in rural-urban perimeter of Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil. The experiment was conducted in randomized blocks, in factorial disposition, composed of the following treatments: Control (C), Transposition of Soil (TS), crushed waste of urban afforestation (RT), Transposition of soil mixed to crushed waste of urban afforestation (TS+RT), and artificial perches. During 12 months, abundance and richness of seedlings laid down were evaluated and for seven months the seed rain in sinks. Results point that the soil transposition was the most efficient method for restoration of the degraded area. Additionally, artificial perches using proved to be efficient, pointing to wealth increase trend and floristic wealth of dispersed seeds. However, the exotic vegetation of the urban area has strong influences on floristic composition, whose succession will have different trajectory of original vegetation.

AB  - Aiming to provide basis for the establishment of Attalea phalerata sustainable harvesting management plan, the results of the evaluation of the population structure and its respective natural regeneration potential are presented. Based on the obtained data, it was evaluated the potential capacity of fruit and oil yielding, related to the studied area. The research was performed in a 1ha plot representative of Acuri Dense Forest, located at RPPN SESC PANTANAL (Barão de Melgaço Mun., Mato Grosso state, Brazil). A total of 1164 individuals were registered, being 462 representatives of reproductive adults and 209 representatives of immature adults. 123 individuals were included as young and 370 as seedlings. The population had an inverted- J age structure, characteristic of stable populations with constant regeneration potentiality. The minimum immediate potential productivity was ca. 323 up to 970 Kg ha-1 for the mesocarp oil and 370 up to 601 Kg ha-1 for the kernel oil. The maximum immediate potential productivity was ca. 970 up to 2910 Kg ha-1 for the mesocarp oil and 1109 up to 1802 Kg ha-1 for kernel oil.

AB  - Little is known about the relationship involving arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi and functional groups of plants that characterize different phases of tropical succession. We appraised the AM infection intensity of root cortex and spore density in the soil in sites over tropical successional gradients (grassland, secondary forest and mature forest) for several years in Araucaria, Atlantic and Pantanal ecosystems in Brazil. The intensity of AM infection decreased with advancing successional stages in all ecosystems and it was around 60-80% in early stages of succession, 37-56% in secondary forests and 19-29% in mature forests. Similarly, the AM spore number also decreased with advancing succession and was the highest in early stages (73-123 g-1), intermediate in secondary forests (32-54 g-1) and lowest in the mature forests (10-23 g-1). To verify whether such reductions influenced the potential of AM inoculum in soil, seedlings of Heliocarpus popayanensis (Malvaceae) were grown as test plants in soils obtained from five grasslands, five young secondary forests, and five mature forests in the Atlantic ecosystem. The soil inocula from the grasslands and secondary forests were 7.6 and 5.7 times more effective in stimulating seedling growth than inocula from the mature forests, respectively. Our results show that plant species in grasslands and young secondary forests stimulate the multiplication of AM fungi, leading to a higher potential of the AM inoculum. In later-successional stages, plant investment in AM fungi decreases and the potential of the AM inoculum is also reduced. © 2012 Cambridge University Press.

AB  - The knowledge of some of the aspects of environmental impacts made by a determinated activity on a local scale is a very important tool to discuss about the relationship between humans and nature. Many environmental problems are the result of ignorance about the limits of the physical mean causing misuse of those resources. This research aims to characterize the impacts of mining of 10 producers located in "Ribeirão Jacutinga" watershed. The small mining of raw material (clay) from Corumbataí formation causes impacts in this sub-basin and the region for a long term. It was Geographic Information System for analysis of satellite images (Landsat-TM) and data obtained on the cartographic basis (scale 1:10.000) as means of impact characterization. The main impacts identified were related to mining activities: open pits in lowland sites, lake formation in abandoned pits, changes in the landscape, lack of actions for recovery of mined areas, cutting of native forest in previous years. Also was identified greater environmental fragility in the watershed, which is associated with areas of greater slope or the extraction sites. Mineral exploration has brought significant changes in the natural environmental of this sub-basin; hence the importance of knowing more about environmental limitations. Moreover is important the development of technologies that allow impact management. This study concludes that it is very important to respect the limits imposed by the physical environment and valuing sustainable activities.

AB  - This study was carried out on a fragment of semi-deciduous forest in Pirenópolis, Goias, Brazil and investigated the changes in the photon flux density in relation to silvicultural interventions that aimed at increasing growth of tree species but without allowing invasion by exotic species that could influence the dynamics of natural regeneration. The design was a randomized block in factorial, testing the differences between silvicultural treatments, seasons and heights in the understory (1.30 m versus at the ground level). We tested two intensities of selective cutting of individual trees and vines in the forest. The treatments were sufficient to alter the understory light, both in the dry season and rainy season, in agreement with the hypothesis tested. The shading in the control area was 97% in the rainy season and 86% in the dry season, showing significant differences with the shading associated with silvicultural treatments, which ranged from 93% to 94% in the rainy season and from 77% to 80% in the dry season. This study may assist this forest management system for semi-deciduous forests in Central Brazil, and should be linked to population studies and community, preserving the forest fragments found in the region and generating numerous environmental benefits and extra income for the rural population.

AB  - The Atlantic Forest is a conservation hotspot due to its elevated level of biodiversity and current state of degradation. Some areas of Atlantic Forest have been replaced by eucalyptus monocultures in Brazil. Soil arthropods can be important indicators for assessing the recomposition of native forests after disturbs. This study aimed to test the hypothesis that exist differences in the composition and structure of soil arthropod communities among two plantations of eucalyptus (Corymbia citriodora) in different stages of natural regeneration of Atlantic forest (YP = Young Plantation and MP = Mature Plantation, in less and more advanced stage of regeneration, respectively) and a fragment of Atlantic forest (FOREST), in wet and dry seasons, in União Biological Reserve, Brazil, using pitfalls. Archaeognatha, Diplura, Opilionida, and Thysanura were restricted to the FOREST, while Diptera, Isoptera, and Orthoptera were favored by the microclimatic conditions in eucalyptus plantations. Soil arthropod community in FOREST was more complex than those in eucalyptus plantations. In general, soil arthropod communities showed higher total abundance and richness of groups, while equability decreased, as regeneration of Atlantic forest advanced in eucalyptus plantations, making this community more similar to that observed in the FOREST. The average total abundance, average richness, and total richness of soil arthropods were higher in the wet season in all areas, but the opposite occurred for the equability. Soil arthropod community improved with the regeneration of native forest species under the eucalyptus plantations.

AB  - Parapiptadenia rigida is a tropical early secondary succession tree characteristic of the Tropical Atlantic Rainforest. This species is of great ecological importance in the recovery of degraded areas. In this study we investigated the variability and population genetic structure of eight populations of P. rigida. Five AFLP primer combinations were used in a sample of 159 individuals representing these eight populations, rendering a total of 126 polymorphic fragments. The averages of percentage of polymorphic loci, gene diversity, and Shannon index were 60.45%, 0.217, and 0.322, respectively. A significant correlation between the population genetic variability and the population sizes was observed. The genetic variability within populations (72.20%) was higher than between these (22.80%). No perfect correlation was observed between geographic and genetic distances, which might be explained by differences in deforestation intensities that occurred in these areas. A dendrogram constructed by the UPGMA method revealed the formation of two clusters, these also confirmed by Bayesian analysis for the number of K cluster. These results show that it is necessary to develop urgent management strategies for the conservation of certain populations of P. rigida, while other populations still preserve reasonably high levels of genetic variability. © 2013, Sociedade Brasileira de Genética.

AB  - What is the importance of open habitat in a predominantly closed forest to the dung beetle assemblage The Atlantic Forest in Brazil is one of the most highly disturbed ecosystems and is mainly represented by fragmented areas. However, in places where human disturbances have ceased, certain areas are showing a natural regeneration pattern. The aim of the present study was to determine how the dung beetle assemblage responds to distinct habitat structures in a fragment of Atlantic Forest. For such, open and closed forest areas were sampled in a fragment of the Atlantic Forest in the northeastern region of Brazil. Pitfall traps baited with excrement and carrion were used to collect the beetles. A total of 7,267 individuals belonging to 35 species were captured. Canthon chalybaeus and C. mutabilis were restricted to open areas. Nearly 90% of the individuals of C. aff. simulans and Deltochilum aff. irroratum were identified in these areas. A higher percentage (> 50%) of Canthon staigi, Dichotomius aff. depressicolis and D. aff. sericeus occurred in closed areas. Abundance differed between areas, with higher values in closed areas. Richness was not influenced by the habitat structure. NMDS ordination exhibited the segregation of areas and ANOSIM confirmed that this variable explained the assemblage of dung beetle species. The findings of the present study validate that open areas are associated to more restrictive conditions, limiting a higher abundance of dung beetle. Although situated near preserved fragments, the studied open areas increase the heterogeneity of the general landscape.

AB  - The use of seedlings from natural regeneration has been recommended as an strategy for seedlings production aiming at forest restoration but many of its technical aspects still need to be scientifically investigated. The objective of this work was to evaluate the effects of leaf area reduction and immediate transplant on the survival and growth of seedlings of native tree species obtained from a naturally regenerating forest. Esenbeckia leiocarpa (Rutaceae), Eugenia ligustrina (Myrtaceae) and Maytenus salicifolia (Celastraceae) seedlings, obtained from a secondary remnant of semideciduous seasonal forest in Bofete-SP, Brazil, were extracted from the ground and submitted to one of the following treatments: I) 50% area reduction of each leaf and immediate transplant; II) no leaf area reduction and immediate transplant; III) 50% area reduction of each leaf, maintenance of the seedling in water and transplant 24h after harvest; IV) no leaf area reduction, maintenance of the seedling in water and transplant 24h after seedlings harvest. The seedlings were evaluated according to their survivorship and height over a eight month period. Results evidenced that neither leaf area reduction nor maintenance of seedling in container with water for 24 hours before transplant affected the evaluated parameters. Thus, leaf area reduction and immediate transplant to pots are unnecessary procedures for use in forest nurseries when seedlings are obtained from naturally regenerating forests.

AB  - Background: Plant community assemblage is influenced by many factors, including soil characteristics and the arrival of diaspores from surrounding areas. These factors may be especially important in transition areas, leading to spatial gradients in the plant community.; Methods: This study was performed in the understorey of an abandoned Eucalyptus grandis W. Hill ex Maiden plantation between a savanna and a forest, 490 m apart, in south-eastern Brazil. This study assessed whether the spatial variation in several variables related to the understorey’s structure and composition is best described by linear or non-linear (quadratic) models. The linear model would indicate a gradient between the two vegetation types, whereas the quadratic model would indicate a stronger effect of the plantation’s edges.; Results: There was a gradient in species composition between the two edges of the plantation. Mean vegetation height was greatest at the savanna edge and lowest in the centre of the plantation. The total number of individuals per plot and the phylogenetic diversity decreased with distance from the savanna edge. Different patterns were observed for different dispersal syndromes, with animal dispersal being more common at the savanna edge, wind dispersal in the centre of the plantation and self dispersal at the forest edge.; Conclusions: The greater number of individuals at the savanna edge may indicate that dispersal and arrival of diaspores are the most important factors influencing community structure and composition of the understorey of this abandoned E. grandis plantation, with most propagules coming from the savanna area. The smaller vegetation height in the centre of the fragment may also indicate older colonisation at the edges. Therefore, in addition to highlighting the recovery potential of undergrowth beneath abandoned Eucalyptus spp. plantations, these results show that this recovery is spatially heterogeneous and that dispersal plays a large role in it. This should be taken into account in restoration projects. The authors recommend careful consideration before removing regenerating Eucalyptus spp. trees as part of the site restoration. Instead the focus should be on the recovery potential of the undergrowth, with gradual removal of Eucalyptus trees, if necessary. © 2014, Dodonov et al.

AB  - The objective of this study was to determine the structure and composition of an Atlantic Rain Forest tract with a land use history of banana plantation 50 year ago and evaluate the factors that influence its regeneration. Individual trees and shrubs with diameter at breast height (dbh) ≥5 cm were sampled within 25 plots of 10 x 10 m for a total sample size of 0.25 ha. We found 311 stems distributed across 92 species, 67 genera and 31 families, with a basal area of 34.18 m 2/ha and a density of 1,244 ind./ha. The ten species with the highest importance value(IV) were the following: Aiouea saligna Meisn., Tachigali paratyensis(Vell.)H.C. Lima, Ficus insipida Willd., Bathysa gymonocarpa K. Schum, Chrysophyllum flexuosum Mart., Piptadenia gonoacantha (Mart.) J.F. Macbr., Piper rivinoides Kunth., Hyeronima alchorneoides Allemão, Miconia cinnamomifolia (DC.) Naudin and Guarea guidonia (L.) Sleumer. The high Shannon richness index and Pielou index (H'= 4.13 nats/ind. and J'= 0.91), are close to those of preserved forest stands of Atlantic Rain Forest, suggesting a good recovery process for this stand, representing an intermediary stage of successional dynamics. The abandonment of the banana plantation created an environment of heterogeneous light conditions, allowing for the entry of species with different establishment strategies. The presence of a remnant tree of the Ficus genus, is related to a popular belief that ended up influencing the vegetation structure. Thus, the species sampled in this study reflected the past land use and the local culture.

AB  - The areas occupied by cocoa crops shaded with native species (cabruca) have an important environmental role. However, studies show that the diversity of native tree species in these areas has been gradually diminishing. The aim of this study is to identify the perceptions and preferences of farmers with regard to tree species which provide shading in cabruca areas and how these local species are employed and managed. The species most preferred by farmers were mainly made up of native timber species with high economic value, followed by fruit species, which were mainly exotic. These species have stood out among the dominant species in cabrucas in the region, as shown by a survey of species carried out in 2008. This is mainly due to the shade management adopted by farmers who tend to favour the cultivation and natural regeneration of preferred species in detriment of less popular species.

AB  - Studies measuring the damage in degraded environments have increased, and it is necessary to obtain reliable biological and ecological indicators for the recovery of such degraded environments and subsequent preservation. This study aimed to conduct a survey of local insects and evaluate their utility in monitoring forest restoration in a degraded area in the Atlantic Forest biome in Ribeirao Grande, State of São Paulo, Brazil. Collections with Shuey traps were conducted from 2006 to 2011 in four distinct forest fragments characterized by environmental impacts, human actions, and phytophysiognomic profiles: Forest (FO), a preserved area with native plant species; "Capoeira" (CA), an area in the natural regeneration process; Planting (PL), an area reforested with native plants; and Pasture (PA), an area with only shrubs. A total of 2,456 specimens of Calliphoridae (Diptera) were collected. Mesembrinella bellardiana was the most abundant (n = 1,884) and dominant species in all environments sampled. The relative abundance of M. bellardiana in the most preserved environment (60.2 % FO, 24.4 % CA, 8.6 % PL, and 6.7 % PA) and other ecological parameters showed that it could be a bioindicator species, i.e., data on its presence or absence directly reflected the status of local preservation. Information on Neotropical dipterans associated with the forested environment is very scarce in the literature. To our knowledge, this is the first study describing the occurrence of Calliphora lopesi (Calliphoridae) in the State of São Paulo. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - This study was set out with the objective of analyzing successional process in areas which are deforested and dominated by Pteridium aquilinum in the Serra da Mantiqueira mountain range, by researching the natural regeneration of shrub and tree species and evaluating both disturbance history and the edaphic conditions on the natural regeneration community. This research investigated two abandoned pasture areas in Bocaina de Minas county exposed to natural regeneration intervals ranging from six years (area named 6A) to twenty years (area named 20A). The inventory occurred from sixty plots of 10 m2, where all samples surveyed were between 0.15 m and 3 m high. All samples were identified and both the diameter in ground level and total height of the specimens were measured. The survey totaled 1,159 samples and 53 species. Melastomataceae was registered with the highest species richness and the highest specimen abundance. The two sampled areas showed species composition differences, with Jaccard similarity coefficient equal to 3.7%. The canonical correspondence analysis showed the correlations between natural regeneration stratum and non-labile phosphorus and clay in the 6A area. On the other hand, the 20A area showed correlations between plant regeneration and the K, P, Ca2+, Al3+ levels, with higher pH levels, and with the sum of exchangeable bases. In addition, the vegetation surveyed in area 20A was correlated with higher Pteridium population density. The results showed that the dominance of Pteridium aquilinum leads to successional process under inhibition, in which the ferns act negatively on the richness and abundance of shrub populations. It was also confirmed the Pteridium's affinity to steep areas, mainly in higher altitudes, where the soil is acid, as well as its preference to disturbed areas. Moreover, we highlight the fragilities of the mountain environments and the importance of preserving natural vegetation, as well as the bracken management as a strategy for forest restoration.

AB  - Tibouchina pulchra (Cham.) Cogn. (Melastomataceae) is a native tree species from the southeast region of Brazil. This early successional species significantly contributes to the characteristic physiognomy and structure of the Atlantic Rain Forest. Saplings were exposed to carbon filtered air (CF), ambient non-filtered air (NF), and ambient non-filtered air +40 ppb ozone (NF+O3), 8 h per day during two months, using open top chambers (OTC). The AOT40 values at the end of the experiment were 48, 910 and 12 895 ppb h-1, respectively for each treatment. After 25 days of exposure, interveinal red stippling appeared in plants in the NF+O3 chamber (AOT40=3 871 ppb h-1). In the NF chamber, symptoms were observed only after 60 days of exposure (AOT40=910 ppb h-1). No changes were observed for total phenolic contents when comparing ozone treatments. However, amounts of tannins and flavonoids were different among treatments. NF+O3 and NF treatment showed enhanced contents of flavonoids, when tannins seem to be reduced after ozone fumigation (p<0.01). Results suggest alteration on phenolic metabolism when saplings are ozone fumigated; those responses, considered T. pulchra, seem to occur before leaf injury appeared, once contents of flavonoids and tannins are also altered by NF treatment (AOT40=910 ppb h-1). This study demonstrates that total phenolic and tannins contents of saplings of T. pulchra also decreased when exposed to ozone. The same alterations were observed for T. pulchra after industrial air pollution, suggesting the reduction on total phenolic and tannins probably is a characteristic response of T. pulchra to presence of any kind of pollutant. © Author(s) 2013.

AB  - The study was carried out in the forest fragment Mata da Onça in Moreno, Pernambuco, with the aim to evaluate the phytossociological structure of arboreal regeneration. To obtain data fifteen plots of 1 × 25 m were demarcated, these allocated in plots of 10 × 25 m existing in the fragment. The analyses were performed on individuals with CBH ≤ 15 cm and H> 1 m, where the heights were divided into three classes: 1) 1.0 ≤ H ≤ 2.0 m; 2) 2.0 < H ≤ 3.0 m and 3) H> 3.0 m. Four hundred and seven individuals were sampled, belonging to 56 species, with a density of 10,853 ind ha-1. The species of greater value of importance were: Cupania racemosa, Eschweilera ovata, Protium heptaphyllum, Miconia prasina, Siparuna guianensis, Anaxagorea dolichocarpa, Cordia nodosa, Erythroxylum citrifolium, Psychotria cf. carthagenensis and Inga thibaudiana. Species with greater value of total natural regeneration were Protium heptaphyllum, Eschweilera ovata and Cupania racemosa. The species which occurred in the three classes of regeneration have greater potential to be part of the future composition of the forest.

AB  - The absence of human occupation sites in southeastern Brazil during the mid Holocene has been referred to as the 'Archaic Gap' (8970-1940cal. a BP) and is predicted to have resulted from increased aridity. A ca. 14 000cal. a pollen history from two well-dated lake sediment cores located within the archeological district of Lagoa Santa, in the State of Minas Gerais, southeastern Brazil, was used to test this hypothesis. Our analyses indicated that the present cerrado and tropical semi-deciduous forest mosaic persisted throughout the mid Holocene, until ca. 5500cal. a BP, and the Lagoa Santa region did not experience especially dry conditions during the Holocene period. The early Holocene pollen spectra contained an assemblage of cold-adapted taxa such as Podocarpus, Myrsine and Araucaria, co-occurring with taxa from cerrado, e.g. Caryocar. A replacement of cold taxa by the modern cerrado-semi-deciduous forest vegetation took place progressively, but appears to have been completed by the mid Holocene. No evidence of sustained drought was found in sedimentation or forest composition, nor any prolonged dry event in the study region. Holocene dryness as an explanation for the abandonment of Lagoa Santa region is not supported by the palynological analyses conducted in this study. Rather it is suggested that unpredictable climate may have underlain that abandonment. © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - In this study, we examine the degradation of tropical forests caused by the forest fires of anthropogenic origin that have frequently and intensely affected a large portion of the State of Roraima (northern Brazilian Amazon), such as the one that occurred in 1998 and extended over 12,000km2. In a region located in the so-called " Arc of Fire" in the State, data from all individuals with DBH≥10cm were collected in 50 sample plots (12.5ha). These plots were collected across five fire-degradation levels (classes), from unaffected areas to areas affected by one, two or three fires over 10years: 1998, 2003 and 2007. The floristic and phytosociological quantitative parameters in the analysis were as follows: species richness (defined classically and by rarefaction), evenness, Shannon diversity index, mixture coefficient, importance value (dominance, density and frequency), basal area, diameter, total height and volume. In the full set of plots, 5593 individuals were measured and identified in 177species/morphospecies and 53 families. We performed both univariate (ANOVA and Tukey's test) and multivariate analyses (ordination methods), aiming to find patterns of degradation by fire. The results revealed that forests affected by one low-intensity fire (BF1L) showed slight evidence of alteration in comparison with forests that have not burned (UF), taking all indicators evaluated into account. In extremely degraded forest plots, the heavily impacted forests lose their primary-forest characteristics, showing significant floristic and structural changes and similarity to areas of young secondary succession. Some aspects of these disturbances were observed not only in twice or thrice-affected areas (BF2, BF3) but also in areas that suffered from one high-intensity fire (BF1H). Given the observed results, we ought to consider that an extensive " secondarization" process caused by fire could plausibly reach more forest areas in this part of the Amazon in the near future. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Several studies in temperate forests have demonstrated effects of litter addition on decomposers and predators. However, adding litter does not allow separating the effects of food availability and habitat space. We investigated the response of decomposers and predators to increased food resources and space in forests of the southern Mata Atlântica of Brazil. In two forest ecosystems representing an early successional stage of secondary forests and old-growth forest, we added nutrient-rich organic material, artificial litter of no nutritional value, or a combination of both to the soil surface of 120 plots to separate the effects of habitat space and food on soil food webs. We sampled litter- and soil-dwelling arthropods after three months using pitfall traps, soil sample extraction, and sticky traps just above the soil. Adding artificial litter had no positive effect on any of the 17 analyzed arthropod groups. Combining all sampled arthropods the effect was even significantly negative. Adding food had a positive effect on the abundance of decomposers, but not predators. We found no interactions between added artificial litter and added organic material. Our results suggest that the soil fauna in tropical forests is food limited. The lack of a bottom-up effect on predators suggests that they are not predominantly regulated by the abundance of epigeic prey but rather by competition or predation. © 2013 Gesellschaft für Ökologie.

AB  - Paquequer basin (269 km2), is located in Teresópolis, a mountainous region of Rio de Janeiro state. It is covered by forest, vegetation in different ecological succession stages and a meaningful urban area along the river main valley. The basin was hydrological characterized based on rainfall and discharge analysis from a temporal range. Granites and gneisses are covered by latosoils and cambisoils. The hydrological data (rainfall and discharge) were collected between June/2007 and May/2009. The headwater is more rainy (2800 mm/year) than the basin outlet (1400 mm/year), but the seasonal rainfall pattern is the same. Headwater rainfall above 10mm is enough to form a hydrograph at the basin outlet (38 km away), within 24 hours. Under extreme precipitation (above 20 mm/h) discharge increases up to 9.5 times, peak discharge is controlled by antecedent flow condition and the average lagtime is 6-20 hours. Fast flows are very important in the stormflow, mainly in summer, hiding subsurface and subterranean flow contributions. The urban areas, the presence of great slopes, shallow soils and rocky outcrops explain this hydrological behavior. The results developed can be used in a flooding warning system to help city management.

AB  - Extensive eucalyptus plantations are observed in Brazil, especially in Minas Gerais State, which has this culture as a profitable activity in marginal areas. Trying to reduce effects of forest harvest on native vegetation and selection of some species as angiquinho (Mimosa gemmulata Barneby), this study aimed to evaluate secondary succession in eucalyptus stands of different ages and managements after exploration, the floristic composition and horizontal and vertical structure of shrub-arboreal was compared with fragments of Cerrado. The work was conducted in a representative area of this biome on Vale do Jequitinhonha. Phytosociological parameters and the indexes of diversity and similarity were calculated at the environments with initial and advanced recuperation, with and without eucalyptus. Control environment was Cerrado restricted sense. There were samples of 42 families, 99 genera, 150 species and 1268 individuals. Floristic composition and phytosociological parameters indicated existence of families, genera and species of great relevance, typical of Cerrado. Removing eucalyptus at initial regeneration did not affect diversity. However, removing at advanced stage provided diversity reduction, permitting colonization by pioneer species as Mimosa gemmulata Barneby. On the other hand, maintaining eucalyptus at advanced recuperation resulted in higher values of diversity and other natural attributes. Results will subsidize management practices to be adopted in similar areas, aiming biological diversity maintenance in sites used in biodiversity corridor reestablishment among cultivated areas.

AB  - Anadenanthera macrocarpa (Benth.) Brenan is a tree species belonging to the family Leguminosae-Mimosoideae which is popularly known as mimosa-black. It features characteristics of early successional, natural occurrence in Brazil and can form clusters almost homogeneous, with great potential in the recovery of degraded areas. This study was conducted at the Center for Agricultural Sciences, University Federal of Alagoas state, aiming at the physical and morphological characterization of seeds, describing the various stages of post-seminal development, and to evaluate various conditions of temperature and substrate to perform the test germination. The seeds were manually extracted, then homogenized, where two samples of 50 seeds were used to determine the initial moisture. Another sample, consisting of eight repetitions of 100 seeds was used to measure the biometry and the number of seeds per fruit. The morphological characterization and the seeds were immersed in distilled water to allow the cuts to the observed structure in microscopes. In the post-seminal study, it was observed the daily processes of seedling growth in rolled paper filter and constant temperature of 30 °C. To assess the germination behavior, the constant temperatures of 15 °C, 25 °C, 30 °C, 40 °C and 20-30 °C as well as the paper and the sand substrates were tested and it was evaluated the percentage, the rate of germination, the relative frequency distribution, and the tests conducted in a randomized design in factorial 5 x 2 (x substrate temperature) with four replicates of 25 seeds, and the averages compared by Duncan 5 % probability. The fruits of black angico show great variation in the seed number per fruit. The embryonic axis occupies part of the central region of the seed with axial and linear positions. The germination is epigeal and the seedlings are fanerocotylar. The temperature determines the 30 °C and the filter paper substrate provided higher average percentage and germination rate.

AB  - We characterized and compared the use of nitrate (N-NO-), in three recognized pioneer and secondary tropical species, analyzing their relationships with the availability of inorganic nitrogen in the soil of a riparian forest. We tested the hypothesis that pioneer species of the ecological succession (Cecropia glaziovi - Cgl) would be more responsive to N-NO -available and would have high nitrate reductase activity (NRA) in leaves while secondary species (Inga marginata - Ima and Hymenaea courbaril - Hco) would have less responsiveness and would have lower levels of this enzyme on its leaves. We evaluated, tested and compared the NRA and N-NO -content in leaves and xylem sap of each species. We measured N-NO-and N-NH+4 content in the soil. The results for Cgl showed an N-NO-content of xylem sap that met the demand of NRA and were correlated with inorganic soil nitrogen, showing the responsiveness of species to N-NO-. Hco was verified as less responsive to assimilation and high N-NO-content in leaves. The species Ima showed an intermediate behaviour, which suggests the possibility of use of other nitrogen forms. The ecophysiological behaviours of the plants were related to the seasonal variation and indicate that these plants use strategies with different responsiveness to the use of soil N-NO-. In this sense and considering that these species are typically used in ecological restoration projects in Brazil, the knowledge of a strategy for nitrogen use specific to each of them can assist in choosing the species appropriate to the edaphic conditions of the environment. © Author(s) 2012.

AB  - In order to gather information on the culicid fauna of Nova Iguaçu Municipal Park, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, adult and immature stages were collected with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention miniature light traps, and dippers and suction tubes, respectively. In all, 828 adult and 990 immature specimens were collected belonging to 12 genera. Among the species collected were Aedes aegypti, Ae. albopictus, Ae. fluviatilis, Ae. scapularis, Haemagogus leucocelaenus, and Psorophora ferox that are considered of potential medical importance. Culicids used a variety of larval habitats and bred under diverse ecological conditions, mostly in natural water containers formed by bamboo, bromeliad, ground depression, rock pool, stream, tree hole, and in artificial containers such as abandoned bathtub, car carcass, abandoned sink, plastic cup, waste tire, and water tank. Species richness and diversity increased from lower to higher forest cover and was highest in sites with highest diversity and high number of larval habitats. © 2014 by The American Mosquito Control Association, Inc.

AB  - Background: Despite being an ancient practice that satisfies basic human needs, the use of wild edible plants tends to be forgotten along with associated knowledge in rural communities. The objective of this work is to analyze existing relationships between knowledge, use, and management of native wild edible plants and socioeconomic factors such as age, gender, family income, individual income, past occupation and current occupation. Methods: The field work took place between 2009 and 2010 in the community of Carão, Altinho municipality, in the state of Pernambuco in northeastern Brazil. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 39 members of the community regarding knowledge, use and management of 14 native wild edible plants from the Caatinga region, corresponding to 12 vegetable species. In parallel, we documented the socioeconomic aspects of the interviewed population (age, gender, family income, individual income, past occupation and current occupation). Results: Knowledge about edible plants was related to age but not to current occupation or use. Current use was not associated with age, gender or occupation. The association between age and past use may indicate abandonment of these resources.Conclusion: Because conservation of the species is not endangered by their use but by deforestation of the ecosystems in which these plants grow, we suggest that the promotion and consumption of the plants by community members is convenient and thereby stimulates the appropriation and consequent protection of the ecosystem. To promote consumption of these plants, it is important to begin by teaching people about plant species that can be used for their alimentation, disproving existing myths about plant use, and encouraging diversification of use by motivating the invention of new preparation methods. An example of how this can be achieved is through events like the " Preserves Festival". © 2013 Cruz et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - Tropical plantations are considered a viable option to sequester carbon on abandoned agricultural lands, but implications of tree species selection for overall greenhouse gas budgets on plantations have been little studied. During three wet seasons, we investigated the influence of nine tree species on soil pH, temperature (ST), bulk density (BD), moisture content water filled pore space (WFPS), and greenhouse gas fluxes in diverse forest sites and monoculture plantation plots. All sites were on clay-rich soils of the Barreiras formation, in east-central Amazônia, Brazil. We found that ST and BD were 0.6°C and 0.2 g/cm3 higher in the plantation relative to the forest, and soil CH4, CO,2 and N2O fluxes were, respectively, 38, 12, 62, percent lower in the plantation. Tree growth rates were highly variable on the plantation, with the mean comparable to the forest sites. Tree species identity mattered (P < 0.01) for all soil properties and gas fluxes on the plantation, but only for pH, BD, WFPS, and N2O fluxes in the forest. The species rank order of pH and N2O fluxes in the forest, however, were unlike the plantation. Tree growth rates were a strong predictor for soil WFPS, and together with location, they also explained 75 percent of the mean N2O flux variation. Our study indicates that: (1) tree species influence soil processes; and (2) high tree growth and low soil gas emissions imply a reduced climate forcing effect from plantations, especially when planted with fast-growing legume species on abandoned farmland. © 2013 The Association for Tropical Biology and Conservation.

AB  - The landscapes are highly dependent on the dynamics of local land use and land cover, which directly affects landscape structure and determines the spatial patterns of forest patches, as well as to the major land uses within a specific region. The calculation of landscape metrics can support the understanding of such spatial distribution. In this study, 16 landscape metrics were analyzed in a drainage watershed in a high relief region in the Rio de Janeiro state, Southeastern Brazil, with the aim to evaluate the use of landscape metrics as indicators for agricultural management. Metrics calculation was followed by a Principal Component Analysis, which indicated the metrics that were most effective in evidencing the landscape structure in analysis. The results showed that the late-succession forest is the dominant component in the landscape. This class also presented the highest MPS metric value, related to the mean patch size by class. Some PCA results suggest that the metrics association was less effective in clustering the overgrown pasture, clean pasture, and annual crops classes, but this could result from the intrinsic association among those classes, by crop rotation, meaning the abandon of a site formerly occupied by an annual crop. Some metrics better suggested an interaction among land use classes and have potential to be use in the analyses of agricultural landscapes in high relief sites. © 2013, IGI Global.

AB  - This study aimed to analyze the structure of natural regeneration of economically important woody species of Caatinga in the municipality of Floresta-PE, assisting with information for sustainable forest management of the forest physiognomy. The forest inventory was conducted in an area of about 50 ha of savanna vegetation (8°30'37″ S and 37°59′07″ W), municipality of Floresta-PE. With 40 sampling units of 5 × 5 m, were measured the subjects into four classes: class 1 = 20 - 50 cm, class 2 = 51 - 100 cm, class 3 = 101-150 cm, class 4 = greater than 151 cm and less than 6 cm in circumference of the base height. In only 37 plots had individuals in the level of inclusion and were identified 15 species belonging to seven botanical families, especially Euphorbiaceae, Fabaceae and Anacardiaceae. The diversity of Shannon-Weaver index (H′) was 1.91 nats.ind.-1, the uniformity of Pielou index (E) equals 0.71. The area presented estimated density of 2,080 ind. ha-1. The spatial distribution showed that the characteristics of most species occur in group or with a tendency to grouping. The species Bauhinia cheilanta and Poincianella bracteosa showed higher density values and were present in all classes of natural regeneration, providing evidence that they have potential to establish themselves on the area and possibly will be the dominant species after reaching adulthood.

AB  - For the maintenance and conservation of riparian areas it is necessary to know the layer's of the forest, like the natural regeneration of. According to that, the porpoise of this paper is to characterize the natural regeneration of a riparian forest in the city of Jaguari, central region in Rio Grande do Sul, by describing the diversity, structural parameters of natural regeneration, dispersion syndromes and ecological groups. For the sampling were plotted systematically 15 samples with size 5 × 10 m. Inside the plots were identified and measured the trees with height (h) equal or greater than 1.5 m, and diameter at breast height (DBH) less than 10 cm. Were sampled 546 individuals from 16 families and 26 species. The family Myrtaceae presented the highest number of species (6 species) and the greatest percentage of trees (54.8%). The Shannon's index was equal to 2.21 nats.ind-1 and Pielou's index was equal to 0.68, indicating low diversity and an uniform distribution among the species. Eugenia uniflora L. was the most characteristic species of natural regeneration. We observed that there is a deficit of small-sized individuals (0,3 ≤ DAP < 1,3 cm; 1,5 ≤ h < 2,5 m). The zoochoryc syndrome was most expressive in natural regeneration, being the main form to spread diaspores on place. Most species were classified as initial secondary (50%) or pioneer (26.9%), indicating that the riparian vegetation is altered, this indicate that riparian vegetation is in phase of recuperation of antropic activities.

AB  - The time required to regrowth a forest in degraded areas depends on how the forest is removed and on the type of land use following removal. Natural regeneration was studied in abandoned old fields after intensive agricultural land use in areas originally covered by Brazilian Atlantic Forests of the Anchieta Island, Brazil in order to understand how plant communities reassemble following human disturbances as well as to determine suitable strategies of forest restoration. The fields were classified into three vegetation types according to the dominant plant species in: 1) Miconia albicans (Sw.) Triana (Melastomataceae) fields, 2) Dicranopteris flexuosa (Schrader) Underw. (Gleicheniaceae) thickets, and 3) Gleichenella pectinata (Willd.) Ching. (Gleicheniaceae) thickets. Both composition and structure of natural regeneration were compared among the three dominant vegetation types by establishing randomly three plots of 1 × 3 m in five sites of the island. A gradient in composition and abundance of species in natural regeneration could be observed along vegetation types from Dicranopteris fern thickets to Miconia fields. The gradient did not accurately follow the pattern of spatial distribution of the three dominant vegetation types in the island regarding their proximity of the remnant forests. A complex association of biotic and abiotic factors seems to be affecting the seedling recruitment and establishment in the study plots. The lowest plant regeneration found in Dicranopteris and Gleichenella thickets suggests that the ferns inhibit the recruitment of woody and herbaceous species. Otherwise, we could not distinguish different patterns of tree regeneration among the three vegetation types. Our results showed that forest recovery following severe anthropogenic disturbances is not direct, predictable or even achievable on its own. Appropriated actions and methods such as fern removal, planting ground covers, and enrichment planting with tree species were suggested in order to restore the natural forest regeneration process in the abandoned old fields.

AB  - Both passive and active restoration are limited by diaspore arrival from neighboring sources. Surrounding landscape is thus important for restoration success in fragmented landscapes, where reforestation, for long periods, may be limited to the planted species pool. We sampled woody species regeneration in 17 reforestation sites in Southern Brazil to investigate the effects of distance to seed sources and amount of remaining nearby Atlantic Forest habitat. The abundance and species richness of regenerating plants were explained by multiple regressions performed using plantation age and species richness, distance to the nearest patch, and surrounding habitat. Distance to the nearest forest remnant, through both the matrix in a straight line and riparian vegetation, was the best predictor of species richness and abundance of regenerating plants. Riparian corridors doubled the distance at which forest remnants influenced restoration sites. However, the area of forest remnants in the site neighborhood did not influence regeneration diversity, suggesting that the quality of both the seed source (including the status of seed dispersing fauna) and reforestation environment for the establishment of forest species should be investigated. © 2013 ABECO.

AB  - In the last two decades an increasing number of models and techniques aimed at restoring natural highdiversity tropical forests is being developed in Brazil and abroad. However, many of these efforts did not show satisfactory results and a legal and normative framework was created to guide these actions, particularly in the state of São Paulo. The convenience of this legislation is controversial and has triggered intense discussion about the assumptions on which it is based and its efficacy. In this study, from a sampling of around 4000 individuals, secondary succession in ten areas with ages varying from 2 to 60 years, was compared with the current regulations for the restoration of highly diverse tropical forests. The density ranged from 2,180 individuals ha-1 in an area of 11 years succession to 7,825 individuals ha-1 in an area with four years of fallow land. The richness sampled was directly proportional to the fallow time. The proportion of pioneer species was inversely proportional to the time of abandonment. The proportion of pioneers was less than the minimum of 40% stipulated in resolution SMA 08/2008. Most areas presented values below the stipulated by 08/2008 Resolution that would be a minimum of 40% for any of ecological groups (Pioneer and Non Pioneer). Eight of the studied areas exceeded the maximum limits established for these groups in the resolution. The analisis of the ecological succession process during the fallow of the shifting cultivation areas, showed that many requirements of the Resolution SMA 08/2008 do not conform to what occurs naturally in the Atlantic Forest. These requirements may bring negative outcomes to the effectiveness of policies and projects to restore areas of Atlantic forest in São Paulo.

AB  - Preserved vegetation fragments can serve as islands or germplasm banks that aid in the recuperation of anthropogenically degraded areas. The present study evaluated the effects of the distance to a preserved forest fragment on the recuperation of an abandoned agricultural field that had been naturally regenerating for 15. years in Caruaru, PE, Brazil. Seven 240. m transects were laid out perpendicular to the border between the abandoned field and preserved forest fragment, and each transect was divided into twelve 5 × 20 m contiguous plots, thus forming 12 bands at progressive distances from the preserved site. The height and diameter of all live individuals within each plot with a stem diameter 3. cm at ground level were recorded. At the community level, the number of individuals, their average heights and their maximum diameters did not demonstrate any statistically significant relationship with increasing distance from the preserved vegetation fragment. Only a few species demonstrated any relationship between the distance to the preserved fragment and density, basal area or ecological importance. The anthropogenically altered area had higher numbers of individuals of autochoric species than the numbers of anemochorous and zoochoric species. The relatively long period of abandonment of the area apparently masked part of the role of the preserved forest fragment in restoring the altered area through dispersal because some species could have sprouted from cut stems, while others could have germinated directly from the soil seed bank. The species Croton blanchetianus and Cordia trichotoma were identified as principal colonizers in the initial phases of succession. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Scarabaeinae dung beetles are indicator insects used in the evaluation of the ecological effects caused by changes in habitat structure and ecosystem integrity resulting from environmental degradation. We compared dung beetle diversity in conserved restinga forests (coastal tropical moist broadleaf forest) and in reforested areas of various ages during the rainy and dry seasons, on the coast of Paraíba State, Brazil. A total of 3,634 individuals comprising 14 species were collected. In the reforested areas there was a gradual increase in species abundance relative to the area's age, but in the conserved restinga the abundance of individuals was 10-20 times higher than that recorded in areas of recent reforestation. The highest species richness was found in the conserved restinga and in the oldest reforested area (16 years old) during the rainy season. During the dry season, when environmental conditions do not seem to favor adult survival, most of the species were found in the conserved restinga forest. The dung beetle community structure was related to the increases in habitat heterogeneity in the successional processes of the reforested areas. Our results suggest that reforested areas act as a source of and refuge for dung beetle species. © 2014 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.

AB  - The objective was to characterize the wood product commercially known as pau-de-escora in Manaus, Amazonas. Paude- escora is a key foundation material to build concrete lining or storey in tower buildings. The use of pau-de-escora is very popular in Manaus even in public building construction. To carry out the analyses and the anatomical identification of the material, we used 450 pau-de-escora poles, which were apprehended by the Environmental Battalion of Amazonas Police Force. It was also carried out a social survey to better understand the dynamics of the trade of this product in Manaus. The length of the 450 poles averaged 3.74 ± 0.08 m (CI 95%) and diameter at the base averaged 4.48 ± 0.03 cm (CI 95%). These small differences related to the means indicate that the market requires a very clear dimension pattern for this wood product. The seven most abundant families encountered were: Fabaceae, Annonaceae, Sapotaceae, Lecythidaceae, Lauraceae, Burseraceae and Chrysobalanaceae. The selling price of pau-deescora pole in Manaus averaged R$ 2.63, and the buying price averaged R$ 3.94. The custody chain of pau-de-escora is completely illegal not only in Brazil, perhaps worldwide because it is part of the natural regeneration of primary or recovery forests.

AB  - Introduction: Use of a Bacillus sphaericus based mosquito larvicide was evaluated as an intervention for malaria vector control at a mining site in Amapá, Brazil. Impacts on larval and adult densities of the primary vector Anopheles darlingi were measured over the course of a 52 week study period. Methods: In Calçoene, State of Amapá, gold mining activity occurs in 19 mining sites in gold-miners of Lourenço. Large pools are formed in mining sites and naturally colonized by Anopheles darlingi. During one year, the impact of applications of VectoLex® CG to these larval sources was evaluated. Applications of 20kg/ha were made as needed, based on 10 immature (3rd, 4th instars and pupae) surveillance of health and established thresholds. Results: One hundred percent initial control was observed 48h after each treatment. The pools received from 2-10 (5.3±1.6) treatments during the year. The average re-treatment interval in productive pools was 9.4±4.3 weeks. During weeks 3-52 of the study, mean density of late stage larvae was 78% and pupae were 93% lower in the treated pools than in untreated pools (p< 0.0001, n=51) while reduction of adult mosquitoes was 53% in comparison to the untreated area during the last five months of the study, which were the rainy season (p<0.001). Conclusions: VectoLex® CG reduced immature Anopheles darlingi infestation levels during the entire study period, and reduced adult mosquito populations during the rainy season.

AB  - The study was conducted in a Brosimum rubescens Taub. monodominant forest in Nova Xavantina, Mato Grosso state (14°49.8'S and 52°9.6'W), in the transition zone between the Cerrado and Amazonian Forest in central Brazil. The structure and dynamics of the natural regeneration was compared over a five-year period to identify patterns that affect seedling establishment and explain the maintenance of B. rubescens dominance. We raised the following questions: how does the structure and dynamics of a monodominant forest regeneration vary over time? What patterns affect seedling establishment and help to explain the maintenance of the monodominance of B. rubescens? Natural regeneration was sampled in 30 plots of 1 m × 1 m (seedlings), 2 × 2 (saplings), 5 × 5 (poles) and 10 × 10 (treelets). In the first inventory, the natural regeneration structure was characterized by a higher concentration of individuals in lower height classes and the largest number of seedlings of B. rubescens may be related to rainfall distribution in previous years. Seedling establishment may be limited by drier periods such as " El Niño" events, or by specific light conditions reaching the forest floor. Formation of a persistent seedling bank may provide a competitive advantage for the regeneration of B. rubescens in conditions of gaps pre-opening thus contributing to monodominance maintenance. © 2012 Elsevier Masson SAS.

AB  - Sustainable use of soil, maintaining or improving its quality, is one of the goals of diversification in farmlands. From this point of view, bioindicators associated with C, N and P cycling can be used in assessments of land-use effects on soil quality. The aim of this study was to investigate chemical, microbiological and biochemical properties of soil associated with C, N and P under different land uses in a farm property with diversified activity in northern Parana, Brazil. Seven areas under different land uses were assessed: fragment of native Atlantic Forest; growing of peach-palm (Bactrys gasipaes); sugarcane ratoon (Saccharum officinarum) recently harvested, under renewal; growing of coffee (Coffea arabica) intercropped with tree species; recent reforestation (1 year) with native tree species, previously under annual crops; annual crops under no-tillage, rye (Cecale cereale); secondary forest, regenerated after abandonment (for 20 years) of an avocado (Persea americana) orchard. The soil under coffee, recent reforestation and secondary forest showed higher concentrations of organic carbon, but microbial biomass and enzyme activities were higher in soils under native forest and secondary forest, which also showed the lowest metabolic coefficient, followed by the peach-palm area. The lowest content of water-dispersible clay was found in the soil under native forest, differing from soils under sugarcane and secondary forest. Soil cover and soil use affected total organic C contents and soil enzyme and microbial activities, such that more intensive agricultural uses had deeper impacts on the indicators assessed. Calculation of the mean soil quality index showed that the secondary forest was closest to the fragment of native forest, followed by the peach-palm area, coffee-growing area, annual crop area, the area of recent reforestation and the sugarcane ratoon area.

AB  - The forest understory is made up of resident and transitory species and can be much richer than the canopy. With the purpose to describe the contribution of these groups to the woody understory, five Atlantic Forest fragments were selected and studied in Northeastern Brazil. In order to analyze the understory's structure, the sample included woody individuals with circumference at breast height (CBH) smaller than 15cm and circumference at ground level (CGL) greater than 3cm, regardless of height. The recorded species were quantified and classified into functional stratification categories (resident and transitory), and the floristic similarity between the understory and the tree stratum was calculated. Species' importance in the understory was analyzed by height and total natural regeneration classes based on a regeneration index. The understory was richer in species (median=63.8, SD=21.72, n=5 fragments) than the tree stratum (43.8, 18.14, 5), and the similarity between these components was relatively high (median=0.54, SD=0.09). The results also showed that the studied under-story in the forest fragments was mainly composed by transitory species (median=67.01%, SD=3.76), that were well distributed among height classes and had the highest densities, which may favor their future presence in the canopy's structure and composition. The typical understory species were grouped into two strata: the lower understory, made up of species that generally do not reach more than 4m in height (mostly species from families Piperaceae, Rubiaceae and Melastomataceae); and the upper understory, with intermediate heights between the lower understory and the canopy, but with average heights that were not higher than 10m (mainly of species from families Anonnaceae, Clusiaceae and Myrtaceae). These families' richness was commonly used as an indicator of the vegetation's successional stage; however, such results must be seen with caution as they show that these families co-occurred and were highly important in different strata. Studying the understory is fundamental because it represents a floristically rich stratum with a unique structure, which promotes the natural regeneration of the tree stratum.

AB  - Does the adoption of agroforestry by small farmers in the Brazilian Amazon promote secondary forest succession on the degraded pastures and crop fields? New results from a small-scale farm agroforestry demonstration project, the RondÔnia Agroforestry Pilot Project (RAPP) that began in 1992 are presented in this paper. In 1992, 242 farmers were surveyed by a stratified random sampling protocol, 50 of whom were selected to participate in the RAPP, constituting its experimental group. The remaining 191 farmers served as a control group. Farmers from both groups were re-surveyed in 2002 (after 10 years) and again in 2010 (after 18 years). Annual site visits to the experimental group farms were conducted from 1993 through 2003 to monitor agroforest plot development and management, and changes in pertinent socio-economic and household demographic characteristics such as household capacity, production systems, and social participation. Differences in property size, number of people permanently residing on the property, and social participation were found between the experimental and control group, with the experimental group having larger properties, more residents, and more participation in mutual aid associations. Control group farmers were also more reliant on cattle production (based on 2009 sales) despite having similar amounts of pasture as farmers in the experimental group. Within the experimental group, very few differences were found between farmers based on the type of agroforestry plot: timber, mixed or non-timber. Remote sensing analyses reveal long-term (10 years+) spectral differences in terms of the similarity to primary forest of both the agroforestry plots and the entire properties of the farms in this study. Experimental group farmers with mixed or timber-based agroforestry plots allowed more secondary forest succession to occur in and around their plots than farmers with non-timber plots. Although, on average, farm properties have become less spectrally similar to primary forest since 1992, properties with agroforestry plots tend to have more secondary succession and/or primary forest on their land in 2011. Several example properties are shown to illustrate the tendency of farmers with agroforestry plots to allow more secondary forest succession to occur on their land. © 2013 The Authors.

AB  - This work evaluated the potential of natural regeneration in the restoration a disturbed water spring surrouding, after stopping the impacts, on forest and wasted grazing land. It was analyzed the structure of the stratum and natural regeneration under canopy and in open area surrounding a water spring under process ofrecovery, located in Nazareno, Minas Gerais. The tree stratum was assessed in 4 permanent plots (10 x 50 m), sampling, identifying and measuring height of trees with DBH > 5 cm diameter. For assessing the natural regeneration, 16 plots (10 x 2 m) were set. Trees with height> 10 cm and DBH <5 cm were identified and measured. The samples were established at 7 and 51 months after the isolation of the area. Phytosociological parameters of the tree and regenerative strata were calculated for each species, classifying them by the type of dispersal and ecological group. Shannon diversity index and evenness were calculated for each community which were also compared by Sorensen index. The results showed that the areas are dissimilar, with most species found at the regeneration under canopy, showing a intake in the system. The communities had a high proportion of zoochoric species and pattern of higher light demanding climax species and a decrease in the proportion ofpioneer species from one inventory to another, indicating progress in natural succession. The density of the individuals regenerating under canopy was much greater, probably due to the dominance of Brachiaria in the open area, showing that use of the regeneration as a unique method of recovery should not be applied.

AB  - Large areas of tropical forests have been converted to agricultural land and subsequently abandoned. If restoration can occur on these abandoned lands, it offers great potential for biodiversity recovery, carbon sequestration, and enhanced ecosystem services. To understand the interaction between different forms of anthropogenic degradation and restoration strategies we examined biomass accumulation at two different scales. First, using small scale comparisons where the tree species pool, climate, and dispersers were similar, we quantified regeneration in degraded sites in Kibale National Park, Uganda subjected to different restoration strategies. Second, we contrasted biomass accumulation for 57 tropical studies where the nature and time since disturbance differed. The above ground biomass of 10-32. year old forest in Kibale ranged from 15,675 to 34,294. kg/ha and was a function of the type of the management strategy used to promote regeneration. The above ground biomass accumulation from other tropical sites ranged extensively; from 470. kg/ha in an 8. year old abandoned pasture in Brazil to 272,000. kg/ha in a 16. year old abandoned agricultural field in Mexico. Overall, the time since abandonment was a good predictor of biomass accumulation. This review demonstrates that once left to regenerate, secondary forests accumulate above ground biomass in a very positive manner; however, the speed of biomass accumulation can be facilitated by site-specific restoration strategies. Both the cost and efficiency of different restoration strategies vary dramatically and our research in Kibale suggests that making larger financial investments does not necessarily result in more positive biomass accumulation. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The movement of frugivores between remnant forests and successional areas is vital for tropical forest tree species to colonize successional habitats. The response of these species to the spatial structure of pasture tree cover is largely unknown. We studied avian frugivores that were found in primary forest edges and large pastures in eastern Amazonia, Brazil. We determined how the small-scale spatial structure of pasture trees at forest edges affects five response variables: bird presence, visitation rate, duration of visit, species richness, and an index accounting for species' level of frugivory and abundance in forests. We used hierarchical linear models to estimate the effect of four predictor variables on response variables: (1) clustering of pasture trees; (2) percent canopy cover of pasture trees; (3) distance of pasture tree to forest edge; and (4) tree crown area. The study species, many of which are widely distributed in the Neotropics, were generally insensitive to percent cover and clustering of trees. Frugivore visitation to individual trees remained constant as cover increased. Visitation was positively correlated with focal tree distance to forest edge and crown area. The positive relationship between distance and visitation rates may be due to the increased abundance of some resource further from forests. If pastures were abandoned the distance from forest edges would not likely limit frugivore visitation and seed deposition under large pasture trees in our study (i.e., up to 200 m distant). © 2012 The Author(s) Journal compilation © 2012 by The Association for Tropical Biology and Conservation.

AB  - In the present work, we aimed to evaluate successional forest stage and horizontal, vertical and diametric structures of upper and under strata on a secondary forest stretch under Araucaria angustifolia on the Bananal Ecological Station, São Paulo state, Brazil. During upper stratum survey (circumference at breast height (CBH) = 15 cm), 43 permanent plots of 10 × 20 m were established. In each plot, five sub-plots of 1 × 1 m were randomly allocated for under stratum (total height = 30 cm and CBH <15 cm) survey. Regarding upper stratum, density and dominance were estimated on 2142 ind./ha and 32.49 m2/ha, respectively, in absolute total values. Concerning under stratum, total absolute density was estimated on 48,302 ind./ha. The diametric structure of the community follows the J-invert pattern, which was not observed for Brazilian Pine population, compromising its maintenance in the community. The auto-ecology of the species supports the catalyzation of secondary succession under its crown, which was classified at middle successional stage.

AB  - Agroforestry systems are an alternative option for sustainable production management. These systems contain trees that absorb nutrients from deeper layers of the soil and leaf litter that help improve the soil quality of the rough terrain in high altitude areas, which are areas extremely susceptible to environmental degradation. The aim of this study was to characterize the stock and nutrients in litter, soil activity and the population of microorganisms in coffee (Coffea arabica L.) plantations under high altitude agroforestry systems in the semi-arid region of the state of Pernambuco, Brazil. Samples were collected from the surface litter together with soil samples taken at two depths (0-10 and 10-20 cm) from areas each subject to one of the following four treatments: agroforestry system (AS), native forest (NF), biodynamic system (BS) and coffee control (CT).The coffee plantation had been abandoned for nearly 15 years and, although there had been no management or harvesting, still contained productive coffee plants. The accumulation of litter and mean nutrient content of the litter, the soil nutrient content, microbial biomass carbon, total carbon, total nitrogen, C/N ratio, basal respiration, microbial quotient, metabolic quotient and microbial populations (total bacteria, fl uorescent bacteria group, total fungi and Trichoderma spp.) were all analyzed. The systems that were exposed to human intervention (AS and BS) differed in their chemical attributes and contained higher levels of nutrients when compared to NF and CT. BS for coffee production at high altitude can be used as a sustainable alternative in the high altitude zones of the semi-arid region in Brazil, which is an area that is highly susceptible to environmental degradation.

AB  - Questions: The growing importance of secondary forests has stimulated research on the patterns of structure, biomass, species diversity and species composition of successional tropical forests. Despite current knowledge, the future of tropical forests and their ability to recover from human impacts are still a challenge for researchers. The Atlantic Forest is one of the most endangered ecosystems on Earth, yet has been reduced in size and distribution due to human disturbance such that most of the remaining fragments are secondary forest at different successional stages. How do these forests recover structure and species composition during succession? What are the main drivers of community assembly during succession? Location: Subtropical Atlantic rain forest, South Brazil (29°42′S, 50°11′W). Method: Using four replicate chronosequences, we described floristic and structural successional patterns of subtropical Atlantic Forest in Brazil, and investigated causal relationships with environmental, spatial and temporal variables in structuring tree species composition. The chronosequences were described by four successional stages, according to floristic (species composition and richness) and structural (density, basal cover and height of trees) characteristics, tested using ANOVA with randomization tests. Time since abandonment and environmental conditions of topsoil, relief and spatial components were considered as possible successional drivers. Hypotheses about causal relationships in the successional process were tested using path analysis, considering the influence of those variables on the successional forest communities. Results: We found that forest stands of 26-45 yr old displayed structural characteristics similar to those of old-growth stands, but that species composition of successional forest was somewhat different from reference areas (old-growth forests). In our study, time since abandonment overcame the influence of environmental and spatial variables on forest assembly patterns in the chronosequences. Conclusions: Our study is the first one describing floristic and structural successional patterns of the Atlantic rain forest in a subtropical context and proposing causal relationships between recovery age, environment and community composition of secondary successional forests. We conclude that the dynamic of forest succession is autogenic and not entirely predictable from local environmental conditions of soil, space and relief. © 2014 International Association for Vegetation Science.

AB  - Isolated pioneer trees have been shown to increase the deposition of animal-dispersed seeds. The effect of gender on seed rain has not yet been investigated, and this study aimed to evaluate whether female and male plants of a pioneer dioecious zoochoric tree differ with respect to the seed rain under their canopies. Seed rain was evaluated for 13 mo, from October 2009 to October 2010, in secondary vegetation of the Atlantic forest in southern Brazil. We used 60 seed traps (0.5 m2): 40 traps under the crowns of 40 Myrsine coriacea (Primulaceae) trees (20 male and 20 female individuals) and 20 at sites without trees. We found 365071 diaspores belonging to 115 morphospecies from 37 families, and 38.3% of the morphospecies were trees, most of them zoochoric. The female trees accumulated a greater number of diaspores and species richness than male trees. The male trees accumulated a higher number of seeds and species than areas without trees. This study shows that sites containing female and male trees of M. coriacea and sites without trees differed significantly in terms of seed rain, and there is a gender effect in this dioecious, pioneer tree species because female plants promote an increase in the richness and abundance of diaspores. © Cambridge University Press 2013.

AB  - Deforested lands in Amazonia are usually converted into pastures and maintained through annual prescribed burning which depletes the soil seed bank. Here, we assess the effect of topography and micro-site conditions on the seed bank and recruitment success of tree species in 20-year old secondary forests developing on abandoned pastures in Central Amazonia, Brazil. Seedling emergence, mortality, and growth were monitored in four 1. ×. 1-m sub-plots located systematically in the center of 21 10. ×. 10-m artificial canopy gaps, seven each on three different topographic positions - plateau, slope, and bottomland. The 84 seedling sub-plots were assigned to four different treatments generated by the combination of two litter treatments, litter intact and litter removed, and two soil treatments, soil turned and soil unturned. Sixteen soil samples were collected from the four corners of each sub-plot for analysis of the seed bank. There was no significant effect of topography on the number of seeds, although on the average, densities on the plateaus and the bottomlands were more than double that on the slopes. Seedling emergence increased 200% with litter removal and 50% with soil turning relative to respective controls. Seedling emergence was significantly higher in bottomlands than in slopes, and seedling growth was significantly higher in bottomlands and slopes than in plateaus, indicating that water availability may be the limiting factor for the recruitment success on the higher parts of relief. There were no effects of topography and litter removal on seedling mortality. Management tools that can accelerate succession on intensively used land offer options for fostering reforestation. Based on this study, manipulating litter and soil micro-environment provide viable methodological tools. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Giant otters (Pteronura brasiliensis) live in groups that seem to abandon their territories during the flooding season. We studied the spatial ecology of giant otter groups during dry and wet seasons in the Vermelho and Miranda rivers in the Brazilian Pantanal. We monitored visually or by radiotelemetry 10 giant otter groups monthly from June 2009 to June 2011.We estimated home-range size for all groups with the following methods: linear river length, considering the extreme locations of each group, and fixed kernel. For the radiotracked groups, we also used the k-LoCoh method. Spatial fidelity and habitat selection of giant otter groups were analyzed seasonally. On the basis of k-LoCoh (98%) method, home-range sizes during the wet season (3.6-7.9 km2) were 4 to 59 times larger than during the dry season (0.1-2.3 km2). Home-range fidelity between seasons varied among giant otter groups from 0% to 87%, and 2 radiotagged groups shifted to flooded areas during the wet seasons. Giant otter groups were selective in relation to the composition of the landscape available during the dry seasons, when the river was used more intensively than other landscape features. However, they seemed to be less selective in positioning activity ranges during the wet season. During this season, giant otters were frequently observed fishing in the areas adjacent to the river, such as flooded forest, grassland, and swamps. © 2013 American Society of Mammalogists.

AB  - Abstract: Land-use change in tropical forests can affect the micro-environment for decomposition under modified canopies. In turn, decomposition may have consequences for soil fertility and ecosystem sustainability. The effects of the conversion from primary forest to pastures on leaf-litter decomposition and its recovery in secondary forests 20 y after pasture abandonment were evaluated using litterbags and a general mixed model approach. Litterbags containing leaf-litter of two contrasting qualities were placed in those three ecosystems and the mass remaining after 90 d was quantified. The mass remaining was 50% lower in high- than in low-quality leaves. The effects of the decomposition environment depended on the substrate quality. Although differences among ecosystems were not significant for low-quality leaves, high-quality leaves decomposed more slowly in pastures than in forests (mean dry mass remaining was 38% in pastures, 14% in secondary and 12% in primary forest). The decomposition of common substrates did not differ among forests. Results show that the conversion of primary forest to pasture may produce conditions for slower decomposition; however, these conditions appear be restored to a great extent in 20-y-old secondary forests.

AB  - Changes in the horizontal structure of a fragment of Mixed Rain Forest, located at Irati National Forest, in Parana state, were evaluated by measurements performed during the years 2002, 2005 and 2008. The study area has 25 ha, divided into 25 permanent sample plots of 1 ha (100 m × 100 m) each. All trees with diameter at 1,30 m above the ground equal or higher 10 cm were measured and identified. Density, dominance, frequency, importance value and cover value were analyzed and, to understand better the phytosociological estimators and successional stage of the forest, the species were classified into ecophysiological groups: pioneers, early secondary, late secondary and undetermined. There was a decrease of 2.3% in the number of individuals per hectare, with 581 recorded in 2002 and 567 individuals/ha in 2008. Currently, Ilex paraguariensis was the species with the greatest number of individuals, representing 9.4% of the total. The dominance (basal area) changed from 28.6 in 2002 to 30.2 m2/ha in 2008, i.e., there was an increase of 5.1% in the period, and currently Araucaria angustifolia has been the species that dominates the forest with 25.9%. The frequency pointed to an uneven distribution of species in the forest, with rates of 47,4% in 2002 and 46,3% in 2008. Araucaria angustifolia was the dominant species and the most ecologically important one in the period with 35.2 (11.7%) of the total absolute importance value in 2008. According to the phytosociological estimators and ecophysiological groups the forest still has a growing stock, due to the increment in trees with bigger diameters from species such as Araucaria angustifolia and Ocotea porosa, and is in advanced stage of ecological succession, with the majority of species and individuals belonging to the early and late secondary, and every year it becomes more mature with the ingress of new species and shade tolerant individuals.

AB  - Conservation and restoration projects involving abandoned cattle pastures pose several challenges. Restoration ecologists recognize that natural restoration is possible, but few species can successfully colonize degraded pastures. The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether land colonized by the tree Myracrodruon urundeuva increase the amount of habitat available for bird communities in Southeastern Brazil. We used fixed point counts within a 50m radius to compare the richness and composition of the bird community inhabiting naturally regenerated M. urundeuva with that an adjacent native forest remnant and a forest restored with planted Acacia spp. We recorded a total of 68 bird species. The M. urundeuva forest was able to provide valuable habitat for bird species, including more forest species, in comparison with the Acacia planting. These results indicate that M. urundeuva is a useful species for the ecological restoration of degraded pasture land.

AB  - The area covered by Eucalyptus plantations is significantly increasing in Brazil for economic reasons. However, the impact of such land use change is still unknown. In this study we evaluated the spatial-temporal distribution and abundance of terrestrial non-volant small mammals on a recently converted landscape whose matrix is formed by Eucalyptus plantations up to 3. years of age. From August 2007 to July 2009 we carried out monthly sampling campaigns over a grid of 30 sampling units, formed by pitfall traps covering both the landscape matrix of Eucalyptus plantations (n= 18) and legal conservation areas of native vegetation (n= 7) and abandoned pastures (n= 5). A total of 1640 individuals from 14 species of the orders Didelphimorphia (4 spp.) and Rodentia (10 spp.) were captured. However, only three species of rodents (Olygorysomys flavescens, Oligoryzomys nigripes and Calomy tener) represented 81.8% of the total amount. Eucalyptus plantations had a lower species richness and abundance than the abandoned pasture and the remaining fragments of native vegetation. Although the present species are predominantly generalists, there is clear distinction among environments in terms of their species composition and relative abundance, which also present a pronounced time variation. The assemblage found in this study suggests that silvicultural landscapes still have some conservation value, with species that seem to be resident at the Eucalyptus plantations. Moreover, the presence of the native and abandoned pastures patches imbibed in the Eucalyptus plantation matrix may increase the carrying capacity of such a silvicultural system and these landscapes may play a role in maintaining local biodiversity. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This work had the objective to analyze the evolution of the environmental condition of four Atlantic Forest fragments under the protection of the Brazilian Army, located in the Metropolitan Region of Recife, Pernambuco, Brazil, by the spatial and temporal comparison of the Leaf Area Index (LAI), generated from Landsat 5/TM satellite images, in periods ranging from 18 to 21 years. Before being under the responsibility of the Army, the study areas were used for sugarcane and pasture grass cultivation. It was concluded that the comparison method using the Leaf Area Index was adequate, evidencing an improvement of the environmental conditions of the studied under the protection of the Military Organizations, with increments of almost 100% in some cases. This trend of progressive environmental condition improvement is established in the opposite direction of what is happening in most studied forested areas in metropolitan areas. This condition indicates the need of conservation strategies for these areas in the future, reducing the pressures for change in soil use, created by the current urban and industrial growth drivers.

AB  - The understory of exotic tree plantations can have non-negligible native species richness. Ecological restoration of these sites may include the harvest of trees, depending on the tradeoff between timber income and harvest impacts on biodiversity. This study aimed to investigate how a site can recover from harvest disturbance, by comparing the regeneration of woody species in the understory of two types of 37-year-old Pinus taeda plantation (P1 and P2, high and low relative density of pine seedlings in the understory, respectively), with stands that were similar to P2 but subjected to harvest and then abandoned for 15years (R sites). Secondary forests (SF) were used as references. We sampled three different sites for each stand condition; soil chemical properties, estimations of litter mass, and canopy cover were measured. P1 had low species diversity, and P2 and R had 50 and 46% of SF richness, respectively. The R site contained few pine saplings and was floristically similar to P2; this indicated that 15years was sufficient for the recovery of plant diversity to near pre-harvesting levels. Soil fertility was highest in SF and lowest in P1. Thus old plantations of P. taeda with low relative density of pine juveniles can be cost-effective starting points for restoration. Despite the destructive effects of pine harvest, recovery of native species can occur rapidly. In situations in which clearcutting of pine stands is not planned or possible, modest thinning of P. taeda adults and/or intensive thinning of juveniles could expedite restoration. © 2013 Society for Ecological Restoration.

AB  - Alchornea castaneifolia (Willd.) A. Juss. (Urana) is a native species with potential for restoration of riparian vegetation and urban forestry. Given the difficulty of its propagation and the lack of knowledge about their behavior in nursery, this study aimed to evaluate the transposition of Alchornea castaneifolia from natural regeneration as a strategy for saplings production in nursery. The collecting took place in Porto Acre - AC, and selected 120 seedlings, which were divided into three height classes (<10 cm, 10-15 cm, >15 cm) and cultivated in four substrates (soil, sand, wasting açaí+soil, Plantmax) in a completely randomized design in a 3×4 factorial design. We investigated the survival of seedlings and the growth in sand substrate to the characteristics height (H) and collar diameter (DC), the relationship H/DC, dry mass of shoots, roots and total between the three height classes of the seedlings. The highest percentage of Alchornea castaneifolia seedlings survival was observed in the sand substrate (67%), followed by the wasting açaí+soil substrate (43%). Seedlings that showed greater growth in height, collar diameter and dry mass production were contained in the class above 15 cm in sand substrate. However, the 10-15 cm class of height presented 100% survival of seedlings in sand substrate and also provided high growth. It is therefore recommended the transposition of seedling in the 10-15 cm class using sand substrate for the propagation of Alchornea castaneifolia in nursery.

AB  - To enlarge the knowledge on sandy Restinga forests in Rio Grande do Sul, it was carried out a shrub-tree component phytosociological and floristic studies of a Restinga forest from Parque Estadual de Itapeva (PEVA). In this study, it was used the the plot method, including all the individuals with DAS (soil height diameter) minimum of 2.5 cm and totaling an area of 0.5 ha. The floristic composition resulted in a total richness of 81 species. The shrub-tree total density in the forest was 4,240 individulas/ha. The family with the highest specific richness was Myrtaceae and, among the species with the highest importance value are Myrsine umbellata Mart. and Sorocea bonplandii (Baill.) W. C. Burger. In the natural regeneration the 10 first species accumulated 54% of the total natural regeneration, with rates from 13.5% to 0.2%. The high observed richness showed the contribution of "Porta de Torres" as an important Atlantic species migratory corridor in the vegetation in Rio Grande do Sul, adding new information on Restinga community structure and floristic in Rio Grande do Sul. The results will contribute to further studies on PEVA dynamic and to environmental reclamation, preservation and handling programs.

AB  - Tropical forest countries are struggling with the partially conflicting policy objectives of socioeconomic development, forest conservation, and safeguarding the livelihoods of local forest-dependent people. We worked with communities in the lower Tapajós region of the central Brazilian Amazon for over 10 years to understand their traditional and present land use practices, the constraints, and decision making processes imposed by their biophysical, socioeconomic, and political environment, and to facilitate development trajectories to improve the livelihoods of forest communities while conserving the forest on the farms and in the larger landscape. The work focused on riverine communities initially in the Tapajós National Forest and then in the Tapajós-Arapiuns Extractive Reserve. These communities have a century-old tradition of planting rubber agroforests which despite their abandonment during the 1990s still widely characterize the vegetation of the river banks, especially in the two protected areas where they are safe from the recent expansion of mechanized rice and soybean agriculture. The project evolved from the capacity-building of communities in techniques to increase the productivity of the rubber agroforests without breaking their low-input and low-risk logic, to the establishment of a community enterprise that allowed reserve inhabitants to reforest their own land with tree species of their choice and sell reforestation (not carbon) credits to local timber companies while retaining the ownership of the trees. By making land use practices economically more viable and ecologically more appropriate for protected areas, the project shows ways to strengthen the system of extractive and sustainable development reserves that protects millions of hectares of Amazon forest with the consent of the communities that inhabit them. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - The use of artificial perches is an efficient technique to forest restoration. We aimed to (1) evaluate the effect of the presence of artificial perches on the number of forest seeds deposited on seed fall collectors, (2) identify the seed dispersal syndromes, and (3) to analyze the effect of distance from the forest border on seed input. Field work was performed in the municipality of Iguaba Grande, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. We installed 70 seed fall collectors (with diameter of 0.50 m) distributed in transects parallelly distant 5, 15 e 35 m from the forest border in abandoned pasture, and in one transect 10 m from the border, in the forest interior. Each transect outside the forest patch received ten seed fall collectors, installed under artificial perches, and ten seed fall collectors, installed without perches. In the forest interior, we installed ten collectors. During three weeks of sampling, we obtained 418 seeds, classified into 242 zoochoric seeds (57.9%) and 176 anemochoric seeds (42.1%). The average seed with the presence of artificial perch was 7.4 (± 3.9) seeds/m2/month while in the absence of artificial perch the average was 1.7 (± 1.8) seeds/m2/month, considering anemochoric and zoochoric seeds. Different distances from the forest edge, up to 35 m, did not influence the number of zoochoric and anemochoric seeds. The presence of artificial perches increased at 118 times the number of seeds dispersed by animals when compared to traps without perches. Artificial perches work as catalyzing structures for forest restoration, with a significant increase in the input of zoochoric seeds.

AB  - This paper provides a comparative analysis of land-use and land-cover (LULC) changes among three study areas with different biophysical environments in the Brazilian Amazon at multiple scales, from per-pixel, polygon, census sector, to study area. Landsat images acquired during the years of 1990/1991, 1999/2000, and 2008/2010 were used to examine LULC change trajectories with the post-classification comparison approach. A classification system composed of six classes - forest, savanna, other vegetation (secondary succession and plantations), agro-pasture, impervious surface, and water - was designed for this study. A hierarchical-based classification method was used to classify Landsat images into thematic maps. This research shows different spatiotemporal change patterns, composition, and rates among the three study areas and indicates the importance of analysing LULC change at multiple scales. The LULC change analysis over time for entire study areas provides an overall picture of change trends, but detailed change trajectories and their spatial distributions can be better examined at a per-pixel scale. The LULC change at the polygon scale provides the information of the changes in patch sizes over time, while the LULC change at census sector scale gives new insights on how human-induced activities (e.g. urban expansion, roads, and land-use history) affect LULC change patterns and rates. This research indicates the necessity to implement change detection at multiple scales for better understanding the mechanisms of LULC change patterns and rates. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Resource availability can influence animal movement causing changes in home-range size and arrangement between seasons. We investigated the influence of acuri palm (Attalea phalerata) on the occupancy of agouti Dasyprocta azare during both the dry and rainy seasons, as well as the abandonment probabilities in the transition between seasons in the Brazilian Pantanal. The agoutis occupied a high proportion of the forested areas in the rainy season (0.83), but the occupancy decreased in the dry season (0.39). In the rainy season, occupancy by agoutis was not correlated with acuri palm availability, while in the dry season, it was positively correlated with the palm's availability. The acuri palm availability also drove the agoutis' probability of site abandonment from the rainy to the dry season, with higher abandonment probability in sites with low acuri palm availability. These findings show that this large-seeded palm can be an important resource for the agoutis' populations during the fruit-scarcity period. The acuri palm seeds may be particularly important for agoutis using fragmented forests, given that the large-seeded palms are able to persist even in small fragments, which is untrue for other important resource. © 2013 The Author(s) Journal compilation © 2013 by The Association for Tropical Biology and Conservation.

AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the floristic structure and composition of the natural regeneration of stretches from Seasonal Semideciduous Forest in different successional stages. Ten plots, 5 × 10 meters in size, were systematically delimited for phytosociological structure in patches of forest which were in intermediate regeneration stage (FEM), advanced regeneration stage (FEA) and abandoned pasture (PAS).We sampled the individuals with ≥ 50 cm in height and diameter at ground height ≤ 5 cm. We performed Detrended Correspondence Analysis and analysis of indicative species of each forest section. In the natural regeneration structure of FEM and pasture it was featured only one species (Psychotria sessilis and Vernonia polyanthes, respectively) in the Importance Value (IV), mainly due to high density. In relation to the FEA there was no strong dominance by one species. The three sections showed distinct species abundance and composition, which suggests that the forest matrix comprises a successional mosaic. Furthermore, each stretch still maintains indicative characteristic species, according to the successional stage they are in. Because of this, management and enrichment actions could be performed to accelerate the succession process.

AB  - Nutrient losses during slash-and-burn clearing in tropical forests, coupled with demand by food crops, can deplete nutrients and result in crop abandonment after 1-2 years. Slash-and-mulch technology prevents nutrient losses from burning, while mulch decomposition may serve as a nutrient source. This research investigates the release of nutrients from the mulch and potential uptake of released N by plant biomass after a multi-species agroforestry system was planted in June 2005, following the clearing of a 1 ha of 7-year-old forest with a mulching tractor in Igarapé Açu, Brazil. The study evaluated soil conditions, mulch decomposition, and nutrient concentrations of Manihot esculenta and native vegetation under treatments of P+K fertilization in combination with four native tree species and N-fixing Inga edulis, or with three native tree species without I. edulis. Mulch layer N, Ca and Mg content decreased in response to fertilization, while mulch layer P and K content increased. Nutrient content increased in M. esculenta stems and tubers with fertilization and in the presence of I. edulis, and in competing vegetation with fertilization. Estimated tree N content increased 311 % with fertilization, but by 154 % in the presence of I. edulis. Fertilization with P+K, as well as the presence of I. edulis, increased N stocks in total biomass. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - Amazonia now contains vast areas of secondary forest because of widespread regeneration following timber harvests, yet the value of secondary forest to wildlife remains poorly understood. Secondary forest becomes structurally similar to primary forest after abandonment, and therefore we predicted that avian movement across the interface of primary and secondary forest (hereafter "the interface") would gradually increase with time since abandonment until recovery to pre-isolation levels. From 1992 to 2011, we captured 2,773 understory birds of 10 foraging guilds along the interface of primary forest fragments and zero- to 30-year-old secondary forest at the Biological Dynamics of Forest Fragments Project near Manaus, Brazil. Our objectives were to understand the differences in land-use history that affect cross-interface movement and to determine how long it takes each guild to recover to pre-isolation capture rates. Across guilds, age of secondary forest within 100 m of the interface was the most important explanatory variable affecting capture rates; rates increased with age of secondary forest for all guilds except non-forest species. Mean recovery to pre-isolation was 26 years (asymmetric SE = 13 years below and 16 years above estimate) after secondary forest abandonment and 9 of 10 guilds recovered within 13 to 34 years. In the slowest guild to recover, terrestrial insectivores, 6 of 12 species were never caught along the interface, and we projected that this guild would recover in ∼60 years. Our recovery estimates quantify the dynamic permeability of the interface and contribute to a better understanding of the value of secondary forests as corridors among primary forest fragments.

AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the horizontal and vertical structures of tree community in regeneration in a fragment of a secondary riparian forest at approximately 30 years of age and to identify the most abundant species in each fragment of the forest to determine the sucessional stage. An area of 800 m2 was subdivided into 16 samples of 10 × 5 m and all individuals with DBH ≥ 1 cm were sampled and identified for the following analyzes: horizontal parameters (DR, FR, DoR, IVC and IVI), vertical parameters (PSR and RNR) and mixed parameters, from of value of increased importance index (IVIa). The survey measured 689 individuals, belonging to 38 families, 74 genus and 109 species. The total density was 8,614 individuals/ha. The index of Shannon's diversity was 3.99 and the index of Pielou's equability was 0.85. Tibouchina pulchra, Psychotria suterella and Endlicheria paniculata obtained high values of IVIa. Guarea macrophylla, Gomidesia anacardiaefolia, Xylopia langsdorffiana and Endlicheria paniculata achieved high values of RNT, indicating adequate natural regeneration in the plot. The initial secondary and umbrophylous species showed the highest ecological importance in this fragment of the forest, with the highest values of sociologic position and importance index. Furthermore, the presence of late secondary species in all layers suggest that the studied fragment is in intermediate succession degree.

AB  - The study aimed to evaluate the phytosociology structure regenerating woody component in riparian area in the 'Mata de Quizanga', in the watershed of River Capibaribe, PE-Brazil. Were allocated 10 plots 1 x 25 m (25 m2), arranged systematically and 25 m apart from each other, being sampled all individuals with Circuference Base Height < 15 cm and with the following height classes (H): 1) 1.0 ≤ H ≤ 2.0 m; 2) 2.0 < H ≤ 3.0 m e 3) H > 3.0 m. Two hundred and four individuals belonging to 41 species, distributed in 28 genera and 21 botany families were sampled. The most representative families in species richness were Myrtaceae, Mimosaceae and Moraceae. Density and absolute dominance values ranged from 8.160 ind ha-1 to 18.88 m2 ha-1, respectively. Individuals' distribution by regeneration class had a predominance of individuals in the first two classes. Helicostylis tomentosa, Eschweilera ovata, Anaxagorea dolichocarpa, Protium heptaphyllum and Protium giganteum species stood out for number of individuals, importance value and natural regeneration, being considered as indicatives of future local forest formation. Shannon index (H') obtained for the fragment was 3.20 nats ind-1.

AB  - In this study the tree structure and diversity were examined in a novel ecosystem (urban forest with 20 years of regeneration) dominated by the exotic species Pinus elliottii Engelm., in Juiz de For a, Minas Gerais, Brazil. We allocated 10 plots of 20×20m in the forest patch (2ha) and sampled all trees with DBH =5cm. We sampled 635 trees belonging to 38 species. P. elliottii showed strong dominance, with 54.2% of the importance value (IV). Other prominent IV species (Eremanthus erythropappus, Anadenanthera colubrina, Tibouchina granulosa and Myrsine coriacea) were pioneers and common in secondary forests of the region. Due to the strong ecological dominance by P. elliottii, the Shannon diversity index (H') was only 1.48 nats/ind, low in comparison with other secondary forests in the region. The results demonstrate the need for management of P. elliottii for the advancement of ecological succession.

AB  - Aim: The primary objectives of this study were (1) to assess, in the light of palaeoecological reconstruction, the climate stability hypothesis used by evolutionary biologists to explain high diversity in historically stable areas, and (2) to identify the response mechanisms of a tropical rain forest microrefugium to climatic variability. Location: North-eastern Brazil, Serra de Maranguape. Methods: Vegetation and climatic changes were reconstructed using a pollen record in a sediment core from a forest hollow, and the chronology was based on accelerator mass spectrometry radiocarbon analyses. Results: Past vegetation dynamics consisted of three main forest types, shown by major compositional changes in rain forest assemblages between 5000 and 1000 cal. yr bp. Dense ombrophilous forest was abruptly replaced by heliophilous early successional tree taxa at 4275 cal. yr bp. These early successional tree taxa were established over a period of c. 100 years, and their dominance lasted for c. 750 years and was associated with dry conditions until 3525 cal. yr bp. Subsequently, the expansion of secondary successional tree taxa over a period of c. 550 years enabled the recovery of ombrophilous forest. Main conclusions: The vegetation changes in the Serra de Maranguape provide evidence for the high sensitivity of this rain forest microrefugium to climatic variability on a multidecadal to millennial time-scale during the mid- to late Holocene. Despite the substantial compositional and climatic changes, this microrefugium apparently was continuously forested and responded to climatic instability by recruiting key species to its highly diverse stock. This evidence helps to address the joint concerns of evolutionary biologists and palaeoecologists regarding how forests can persist during periods of climatic variability by showing that some tropical regions can remain continuously forested despite reorganization during abrupt and short-term climatic changes. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Because forest plantations cover an extensive area worldwide, they play an important role shaping current biodiversity conservation policies. This study evaluated plant species richness in the regenerating forest community beneath five 35-year-old homogeneous forest stands consisting of indigenous terra-firme species (Simarouba amara, Dipteryx odorata, Bagassa guianensis, Jacaranda copaia and Dinizia excelsa). These data were compared to adjacent primary forests in the Manaus region, Amazonas state, Brazil. These plantations are among the oldest native tree plantations of the Brazilian Amazon. All studied stands showed species richness near that of the primary forest, with the single exception being J. copaia. The relationship between species composition and the environmental variables was studied by canonical correspondence analysis (CCA). The CCA yielded correlations that were validated by a permutation test between species composition and canopy openness, nitrogen content, pH, base saturation and soil aluminum content. Our results showed that long standing homogenous plantation stands can provide high levels of density and species richness of the understory, comparable to those found in the surrounding primary forest. This finding reinforces the value of anthropogenic landscapes for conserving biodiversity. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This article addresses the spatial decision-making of loggers and implications for forest fragmentation in the Amazon basin. It provides a behavioral explanation for fragmentation by modeling how loggers build road networks, typically abandoned upon removal of hardwoods. Logging road networks provide access to land, and the settlers who take advantage of them clear fields and pastures that accentuate their spatial signatures. In shaping agricultural activities, these networks organize emergent patterns of forest fragmentation, even though the loggers move elsewhere. The goal of the article is to explicate how loggers shape their road networks, in order to theoretically explain an important type of forest fragmentation found in the Amazon basin, particularly in Brazil. This is accomplished by adapting graph theory to represent the spatial decision-making of loggers, and by implementing computational algorithms that build graphs interpretable as logging road networks. The economic behavior of loggers is conceptualized as a profit maximization problem, and translated into spatial decision-making by establishing a formal correspondence between mathematical graphs and road networks. New computational approaches, adapted from operations research, are used to construct graphs and simulate spatial decision-making as a function of discount rates, land tenure, and topographic constraints. The algorithms employed bracket a range of behavioral settings appropriate for areas of terras devolutas, public lands that have not been set aside for environmental protection, indigenous peoples, or colonization. The simulation target sites are located in or near so-called Terra do Meio, once a major logging frontier in the lower Amazon Basin. Simulation networks are compared to empirical ones identified by remote sensing and then used to draw inferences about factors influencing the spatial behavior of loggers. Results overall suggest that Amazonia's logging road networks induce more fragmentation than necessary to access fixed quantities of wood. The paper concludes by considering implications of the approach and findings for Brazil's move to a system of concession logging. © 2013 by the Ecological Society of America.

AB  - The aim of this work was to examine the leaf area loss in Tabebuia ochracea (Cham.) Standl in two different successional stages in a tropical dry forest in north of Minas Gerais State, Brazil. The study was conducted at the end of the wet season, when the leaves exhibit an accumulation of lost biomass. In two different areas under distinct status of regeneration, 15 plants were selected and 30 leaves were randomly sampled to determine leaf damage. A higher percentage of leaf damage was observed in trees in the latesuccession stage area than in the early-succession stage area (19.48 ± 2.32 versus 10.77 ± 0.83; F1,30=38.9, p0,001). These results corroborate others studies performed in tropical dry forest of America and with T. ochracea in the Brazilian cerrado domain. Studies performed in these same areas show that succession leads to an increase of plant-species diversity, increasing the complexity of the environmental structure. Higher plantspecies richness could lead to an increase in richness and abundance of herbivorous insects that, in turn, could increase the herbivory rates at late-succession areas, since chewer insects contribute with 75% or more of all leaf area consumed annually. © 2013 Instituto de Cîncias Biológicas - UFMG.

AB  - This study aimed to evaluate the floristic composition and phytosociology of tree community of a small urban semideciduous forest fragment (2 ha) belonging to the Botanical Garden of the Federal University of Juiz de Fora, Juiz de Fora, MG, Brazil. Trees (DBH ≥5 cm) were sampled at 25 random plots of 20 x 20 m (1 ha). A total of 2054 trees belonging to 78 species were sampled. There was a strong predominance of species of frequent occurrence in the flora of Minas Gerais State, and species of early sucessional stages (pioneer and early secondary). Due to the strong ecological dominance, the Shannon index of species diversity (H' = 2.82) was the lowest compared with other secondary forests in the region. The community also had a high density of the exotic species Syzygium jambos (the 4th in Importance Value), potentially invasive in neotropical forests. Although the forest fragment has a long natural regeneration (> 70 years of abandonment and development), the results show an immature tree community with low diversity, following the pattern usually attributed to urban forests worldwide.

AB  - This research took place in a semi-deciduous forest fragment in secondary succession stages on Morro do Cerrito in the municipality of Santa Maria, in the state of Rio Grande do Sul. The aim was to determine the floristic groups in the study area by quantifying the sociology of main species and their relationship with geomorphologic and pedological compartments. Permanent plots measuring 10m2 were continuously allocated along the topographical gradient of the hill, beginning at the base and going to the top. All trees with diameter at breast equal or larger than 5 cm height were measured. Grouping analysis was performed by (Twinspan), having as variables the number of individuals of the species and characterized the sites of groups by testing in the field of geomorphological compartments and morphological and chemical analysis of soils. Three ecological groups were found evenly distributed along the gradient as a result of different successions and environmental conditions that were due mainly to the substrate, the soil classes, and landscape positions.

AB  - Discocarpus pedicellatus is an endemic tree species in the Atlantic Forest. It presents natural regeneration from seedling banks and populations with patches of high-density of adult trees in the semideciduous forests of southern Bahia, Brazil. Two studies were conducted, in the field and under greenhouse conditions, aiming to analyze seedling survival and the effects of shade on growth and on photosynthetic characteristics of D. pedicellatus saplings. In the field, the density of seedlings was very high at the beginning of the study, in some cases exceeding 700 seedlings m-2. After two years of observations, density values were between 5 and 190 seedlings m-2 and few individuals showed the first true leaves. In greenhouse, the results obtained for light-saturated net photosynthetic rate (Amax), the compensation irradiance (Ic), the dark respiration rate (Rd), the relative growth rate (TCR) and the net assimilation rate (TAL), suggest that this species presents slow growth, typical of species that regenerate in the understory of mature forests under closed canopies. Also, in response to increase in shading there was a significant decrease in Rd, indicating that the survival in the forest understory may be associated to low metabolic and growth rates. The results indicate that the regeneration strategy by seedling banks and the ability to adjust their metabolism in response to the low available light radiation are important factors that explain the establishment of high-population density patches of D. pedicellatus in the semideciduous forests of southern Bahia, Brazil.

AB  - Questions: What are the main features of the seed rain in a fragmented Atlantic forest landscape? Can seed rain species attributes (life form, dispersal mode, successional status) relate to the spatial arrangement (size and number of fragments, edge density and presence of corridor) of forest fragments in the landscape? How does the rain forest landscape structure affect the seed rain? Location: Atlantic rainforest, São Paulo State, Southeastern Brazil. Methods: Seed rain samples were collected monthly throughout 1 yr, counted, identified and classified according to species dispersal mode, successional status and life form. Seed rain composition was compared with woody species near the seed traps. Relationships between seed rain composition and landscape spatial arrangement (fragment area, presence of corridor, number of fragments in the surroundings, proximity of fragments, and edge density) were tested using canonical correspondence analysis (CCA). Results: We collected 20 142 seeds belonging to 115 taxa, most of them early successional and anemochorous trees. In general, the seed rain had a species composition distinct from that of the nearby forest tree community. Small isolated fragments contained more seeds, mainly of anemochorous, epiphytic and early-successional species; large fragments showed higher association with zoochorous and late-successional species compared to small fragments. The CCA significantly distinguished the species dispersal mode according to fragment size and isolation, anemochorous species being associated to small and isolated fragments, and zoochorous species to larger areas and fragment aggregation. Nevertheless, a gradient driven by proximity (PROX) and edge density (ED) segregated lianas (in the positive extremity), early successional and epiphyte species (in the negative end); large fragments were positively associated to PROX and ED. Conclusions: The results highlight the importance of the size and spatial arrangement of forest patches to promote habitat connectivity and improve the flux of animal-dispersed seeds. Landscape structure controls seed fluxes and affects plant dispersal capacity, potentially influencing the composition and structure of forest fragments. The seed rain composition may be used to assess the effects of landscape spatial structure on plant assemblages, and provide relevant information for biodiversity conservation. © 2012 International Association for Vegetation Science.

AB  - Seasonally dry tropical forests (SDTFs) occupy 27, 367, 815 ha in Brazil, representing 3.21% of the country’s territory (Sevilha et al. 2004). The delimitation of SDTFs used in this chapter follows that used by the Brazilian Institute for Geography and Statistics (IBGE 1992) and does not consider the entire caatinga biome as SDTFs, because most of the caatinga vegetation does not possess a forest structure. The Brazilian SDTFs have a naturally scattered distribution, occurring in several biomes but predominantly in the semiarid northeastern region (see Chapter 1, Figure 1.3).

AB  - Despite greatly improved forest management in recent decades, long-term assessments show that if current harvesting volumes and cutting cycles are maintained, future volume yields of commercial species will decrease. A possible solution is to apply post-harvesting silvicultural treatments to increase the number of valuable trees. In this study we compared during 4years two treatments: tending naturally established seedlings/saplings of commercial species in logging gaps, and enrichment planting+tending seedlings of commercial species. In both treatments, competition was artificially reduced by liberating each focal seedling/sapling from competitors (i.e. other tree seedlings/saplings, lianas, or herbs). The experiment was carried out in an area of ombrophilous dense forest managed by the Orsa Florestal forestry company in Jari Valley, eastern Amazon, Brazil (01°09'S and 52°38'W). The company applies reduced-impact logging in a polycyclic silvicultural system. We sampled 64 2-year-old logging gaps (average area 427.2m2). Thirty-four gaps were used for the planting+tending, 15 gaps underwent the tending treatment, and there were 15 gaps in the control treatment (i.e. no intervention). The tending treatment showed lower mortality rate, faster growth rate, and required less liberation from overstorey plants and lianas than the other two treatments. Half of the species responded positively to tending: the long-lived pioneers Goupia glabra and Laetia procera, and the partially shade-tolerant Dinizia excelsa, Tachigali myrmecophila, and Trattinnickia sp. Similarly to tending, individuals subjected to the enrichment planting+tending treatment also presented higher growth rates. Based on these results we recommend tending be applied to areas with sufficient natural regeneration of commercial species. Enrichment planting+tending should be applied when regeneration of commercial species is scare, ideally using species that have high initial growth rates, and high commercial or conservation value. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This study aimed to characterize the mechanisms of natural regeneration in a Mixed Subtropical Wet Forest remnant. The study was conducted in the National Forest of São Francisco de Paula, RS, Brazil, using six conglomerates (1 ha), with 16 plots (20×20 m) each, disregarding 10 m surround. The sampling of the seed rain (SR) was carried out in 96 circular collectors (1 m2), distributed in the center of each plot. The soil seed bank (SB) was sampled randomly in a distance of 3 m of each SR collector and the seedling bank (SeB) was sampled in plots of 2×2 m, located 4 m from SR collectors, counting the number of individuals (height ≥ 30 cm and diameter at breast height (DBH) < 1 cm) for each species. The regeneration mechanisms were evaluated through the floristic composition and horizontal structure. In SR, were sampled 81 species, 46 genera and 28 families, in SB, 103, 65 and 41, and in SeB, 88, 57 and 36, respectively. The richness found and the presence of species with abundant fruiting and seed dispersal by animals, indicate the importance of seed rain as a strategic mechanism for the balance of flora and fauna in the ecosystem. The soil seed bank demonstrates potential for colonization and immediate restoration of vegetation after disturbances and the seedling bank is the main strategy for regeneration of many tree species that make up the current structure of the forest.

AB  - Currently, a large-scale restoration project aims to restore around 15 million hectares of Atlantic Forest in Brazil. This will increase forest cover and connectivity among remnant sites as well as restore environmental services. Currently, studies on recovery of fauna in restored areas of the Atlantic Forest are practically nonexistent. To address this knowledge vacuum, our study compares diversity patterns of fruit-feeding butterflies in three forest areas with different restoration ages (11, 22, and 54 years), and uses a native forest area as reference. Results showed butterfly communities in maturing restored areas becoming more similar to the ones found in the native forest, with an increase in the proportional abundance of forest species, and a decrease of edge and grassland species. Moreover, we found a higher diversity among sites at the intermediate restoration age, with a community composed of both grassland and forest species. Butterfly species composition differed significantly among sites, showing interesting patterns of potential species replacement over time. Our results indicate that, although restored sites were located in a fragmented landscape, they provide suitable habitats for recolonization by fruit-feeding butterfly assemblages. Hence, restored areas can be considered important habitat for forest animal species, increasing local biodiversity and, possibly, restoring some of the ecosystem services provided by them. © 2014 Society for Ecological Restoration.

AB  - Land use changes have resulted in large environmental impacts, and in agricultural landscapes sometimes only forest fragments remain. Riparian forest remnants can positively influence stream water quality, and serve as refuges for aquatic species. We evaluated whether the presence of a riparian forest remnant influenced the structure and composition of macroinvertebrate communities in a rural stream in southeastern Brazil. We sampled three reaches upstream (within abandoned sugarcane cultivation) and nine downstream the remnant edge, until 600 m inside the forested area, using leaf litter bags. The abundances of Elmidae, Chironomidae, and total macroinvertebrates increased along the forest remnant, whereas the abundance of Baetidae, proportion of Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera (EPT), rarefied taxonomic richness, and diversity decreased. Taxon richness and EPT abundance did not vary along the forest remnant. Increases in Chironomidae and total abundance within the forest remnant can be related to moderate increases in nutrient concentrations, or to the availability of high quality leaf litter patches. Forest remnants can influence macroinvertebrate communities, although variation both in temperate and tropical studies can be related to local agricultural practices and land use at the watershed scale. Forest remnants are important in maintaining stream water quality in rural landscapes, and deserve attention in watershed management projects. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - The present research aimed to analyze and describe spatial patterns and quali-quantitative features of natural regeneration of tree species of Ocotea odorifera (Vell.) Rohwer (canela-sassafrás) in a fragment of Mixed Ombrophyllous Forest (Araucarian Forest) located at the National Forest of Irati, Paraná State, Southern Brazil. Three plots of one hectar each were sampled and height, diameter and location informations were collected for all plants of canela-sassafrás with total height ≥ 30 cm. Univariate analyzes using K-function of Ripley were done in order to describe spatial patterns of plants at different regeneration phases as well as of canela-sassafrás adults. Generally, this species presented an aggregated spatial pattern at all considered scales of regeneration, suggesting to be a typical pattern at initial phases of this species. The change from aggregated to random spatial pattern was tested analyzing different size classes of canela-sassafrás. Some inferences were made considering subjacent processes that could be associated to obtained results. It is possible to say that the studied species presents potencialities for its management and conservation with excellent natural regeneration capacity.

AB  - The dynamics of the bird community in a small forest fragment was evaluated along seven years in relation to changes in the surrounding landscape. The study area is an Araucaria forest fragment in Southern Brazil (state of Paraná). The sampling period covered the years 1988 through 1994 and the mark-release-recapture method was utilized. The landscape analysis was based on Landsat TM images, and changes in exotic tree plantations, native forest, open areas (agriculture, pasture, bare soil, and abandoned field), and "capoeira"(native vegetation ≤ 2 m) were quantified. The relationship between landscape changes and changes in abundance diversity of forest birds, open-area birds, forest-edge birds, and bamboo specialists was evaluated. Richness estimates were run for each year studied. The richness recorded in the study area comprised 96 species. The richness estimates were 114, 118 and 110 species for Chao 1, Jackknife 1 and Bootstrap, respectively. The bird community varied in species richness, abundance and diversity from year to year. As for species diversity, 1991, 1993 and 1994 were significantly different from the other years. Changes in the landscape contributed to the increase in abundance and richness for the groups of forest, open-area and bamboo-specialist species. An important factor discussed was the effect of the flowering of "taquara" (Poaceae), which contributed significantly to increasing richness of bamboo seed eaters, mainly in 1992 and 1993. In general, the results showed that landscape changes affected the dynamics and structure of the bird community of this forest fragment over time, and proved to have an important role in conservation of the avian community in areas of intensive forestry and agricultural activities.

AB  - Recent energy and climate policies, particularly in the developed world, have increased demand for bioenergy. 22Bioenergy generally encompasses a wide range of energy products, but in this paper it refers to electricity and biofuels (mainly ethanol and biodiesel used for transport fuel) generated from agricultural and forest crops, plants and their residues. as an alternative, which has led to both direct and indirect land-use changes and an array of environmental and socio-economic concerns. A comprehensive understanding of the land-use dynamics of bioenergy crop production is essential for the development of sustainable bioenergy and land-use policies. In this paper, we review the patterns and dynamics of land-use change associated with bioenergy crops (hereafter referred to as 'bioenergy-driven land-use change'). The review focuses on four regions as the most prominent locations in which these patterns and changes occur: Brazil; Indonesia and Malaysia; the United States of America (U.S.A.); and the European Union (EU). The review confirms that bioenergy-driven land-use change has affected and will impact most severely on the 'land- and resource-abundant' developing regions, such as Brazil, where economic development takes priority over sustainable land-use policies, and the enforcement capability is limited. Opportunities for more effective policy are available through the development of international climate change policy (e.g. REDD under the UNFCCC), and certification criteria for sustainable bioenergy products (e.g. EU RED). However, bioenergy produced from no and/or less land-using feedstocks (e.g. wastes and residues), and their associated technologies must be given higher priority to minimise bioenergy-driven land-use change and its negative impacts. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Apeiba tibourbou Gaertn and Ochroma pyramidale (Cav. Ex Lam.) Urb. are pioneer species from the Malvaceae family commonly found in early successional stages, colonizing rapidly abandoned areas in the Amazon region. Despite their ecological importance, little is known about them. Our objective is to study their populations' structure and spatial distribution in secondary forests of different ages and in mature forests in southwestern Amazonia, Acre, Brazil. Each site was divided into 12 plots (0.72 ha each) where a 100% inventory was conducted and each tree identified and positioned in an X/Y grid. All individuals with diameter greater than 5 cm at 1.3 m height were numbered, tagged and measured (diameter and height). In total, we found 439 individuals, of which 128 (29%) wee of A. tibourbou and 311 (71%) of O. pyramidale. We also found 9.264 bamboo culms (Guadua weberbaueri Pilger). No individual of both species was found in the mature forest plots. We also did not find seedlings of either species in any of the plots studied, since their seeds can only germinate in direct sunlight. The spatial distribution of both species was found to be aggregated and the diametrical distribution followed a negative exponential curve shape. No association or correlation was found between each species with bamboo abundance or with stand age. Such ecological results are important to understand these species' occurrence in natural habitats and also in reforestation plans and for tree plantations for economic purposes.

AB  - Restoration actions aimed at Mixed Ombrophilous Forests are limited due to the scarce knowledge about composition and structure of these communities on different successional stages, and also the effects of frequent disturbances on its dynamics, such as fire. The present work aimed at evaluating the effect of an accidental fire on the horizontal, vertical and diametric structure of an Araucaria angustifolia planted forest, located on Campos do Jordão State Park, SP, nine years after the disturbance. This study also intends to appraise the potential of these forests on inducing the secondary succession. Two Araucaria angustifolia forests were selected, with similar ages and environmental conditions, called Forests RI and RII. On RI, there's no account of fire since its planting, in 1959 (control). RII, which was planted in 1958, was affected by an accidental fire in July 2001. During the upper strata survey (circumference at breast height (CBH) ≥ 15cm), 17 and 8 permanent plots of 10×20m were established on forests RI and RII, respectively. In each one of these plots five sub-plots of 1×1m were randomly chosen, in order to survey the lower strata (total height ≥ 30cm and CBH < 15cm). In forest RI, 836 trees and shrubs were surveyed, while on forest RII 175 individuals were sampled. Forest RI presented significantly higher values than II for density on both strata and dominance on upper strata (absolute totals). The diametric structure follows an inverted J-pattern in both areas. Nevertheless, the fire seems to significantly have reduced the number of individuals of the first diameter classes. Forest RII seems to still express the effect of burning, which was more severe in the lower strata; in case the above hypothesis is correct. However, due to favorable landscape conditions, we hope that both forests continue their natural succession, resembling the surrounding forest matrix in the long term.

AB  - The present study was carried out at Praça de Esportes Forest, located on the campus of the Universidade Federal de Viçosa, Viçosa, Minas Gerais State. The fragment consists of a 10.65 ha forest in regeneration for 75 years. Four parallel transects mesuring 3 x 50 m, spaced 3 m, and divided into 10 plots of 3 x 5 m each were set for analysis. Sampling of natural regeneration layer included all individuals with height > 0.3 m and DBH < 5 cm. We calculated the phytosociological parameters and classified the fragments into successional class and dispersion syndrome. The floristic composition was compared with several studies of regeneration in Viçosa, through cluster analysis. After analysis, we observed the occurrence of 30 families and 84 species, which the most important were Coffea arabica, Siparuna guianensis, Psychotria sessilis and Erythroxylum pelleterianum The late secondary successional class was the most representative (49.3% of individuals), and 91.6% of individuals presented dispersion syndrome zoochorous. No floristic similarity was observed between the studied area and other forest fragments of the region. The predominance of dispersion syndrome zoochorous in natural regeneration is an important factor to the continued maintenance of frugivorous in the area. The floristic richness and abundance of late secondary species are strong indications that the environment studied is offering ecological conditions suitable for the development of these species, thus allowing the advancement of secondary succession.

AB  - The vegetation of the forests edge shows characteristics of early succession stages. However, this initial stage forest produce leaves that are hard to decompose and have a lower diversity of the soil invertebrates that participate in litter decomposition. Thus, it is likely that the litter decomposition and soil fauna are influenced by the newly created fragments border characteristics. The aim of this study was to evaluate the litter decomposition and soil invertebrates in a Atlantic Rain Forest fragment located in Pinheiral, RJ, Brazil. Litter bags and pitfall traps were installed at the edge and in the interior of the forest to assess the loss of litter mass and the soil fauna, respectively. The litter decomposed more slowly on the edge, where the soil fauna was less diverse and with more expression of bacteria and fungi predators. On the forest interior, with greater soil fauna diversity and higher activity of decomposers and predators invertebrates, litter decomposition showed a tendency to be faster. Accordingly, the fragmentation in secondary forests may slow the dynamic of litter decomposition and, thus, alter the nutrient cycling in the upper soil layer.

AB  - This study determined the temporal patterns of herbivory on Handroanthus ochraceus (Cham.) Mattos (Bignoniaceae) along a successional gradient in a seasonally dry tropical forest (SDTF) in southeastern Brazil. We assessed the diversity of free-feeding herbivore insects (sap-suckers and leaf-chewers), leaf herbivory rates, leaf nitrogen content, phenolic compounds, and spider abundance through the rainy season in three different successional stages (early, intermediate, and late). Sampling was conducted in December, at the beginning of the rainy season (with fully expanded young leaves), February (mid-aged leaves), and April, at the end of rainy season (old leaves). Fifteen reproductive trees of H. ochraceus were sampled per successional stage in each month of sampling. Herbivore diversity was highest in the early stage of succession, but herbivory rates were highest in the intermediate and late stages. This result was probably related to differences in herbivore community composition and leaf quality across successional stages. The highest herbivore abundance was found in April in the early successional stage. In addition, we found low levels of herbivory in the intermediate and late successional stages in the second half of the rainy season. For each successional stage, leaf nitrogen content decreased through the rainy season, whereas the concentration of phenolic compounds increased. For the intermediate and late successional stages, the temporal changes that took place as the rainy season progressed corroborated the following hypotheses postulated for SDTFs: (1) both the abundance of chewing insects and herbivory rates decreased, (2) the abundance of natural enemies (i. e., spiders) increased, and (3) leaf quality decreased. These results suggest that the described herbivory patterns are robust for advanced successional stages (intermediate and late) of the SDTFs, but may not apply to early successional stages of these forests. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - This paper compares the financial attractiveness of forest and agroforestry plantations promoted by external organizations with tree growing practices of Amazonian smallholders. Based on 80 case studies and interviews with 112 forestry professionals from Brazil, Bolivia, Peru and Ecuador, the paper characterizes the economic, environmental and structural implications, and identifies the respective financial costs and benefits. Six case studies provided data for in-depth financial analyses. The results showed that the expectations of externally promoted smallholder tree and agroforestry plantations were not met. Despite significant inputs, smallholders generated at best annual net incomes of US$200-$1,000 per ha from NTFP plantations, and up to US$800-$1,000 from timber plantations in the year of harvest. This corresponded to around one-third of the initially expected returns. Overall, only around 1% of the smallholders participating in such initiatives managed to produce and commercialize any plantation products. Smallholders' practices of complementary tree growing in conjunction with agriculture and managing natural regeneration of timber and NTFP products were often underestimated by professionals. They required low input, didn't rely on external support, were highly flexible in risky environments, and some presented financial returns comparable to some well functioning plantations. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - The influence of plant functional groups and moderate seasonality on arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungal status (root colonization and spore density) was investigated during 13 consecutive months in a chronosequence of succession in southern Brazil, consisting of grassland field, scrub vegetation, secondary forest and mature forest, in a region of transition from tropical to subtropical zones. AM root colonization and spore density decreased with advancing succession and were highest in early successional sites with grassland and scrub vegetation, intermediary in the secondary forest and lowest in the mature forest. They were little influenced by soil properties, but were sufficiently influenced by the fine root nutrient status and fine root traits among different functional plant groups. AM root colonization and spore density were higher during the favourable plant growth season (spring and summer) than during the less favourable plant growth season (autumn and winter). Spore density displayed significant seasonal variation at all sites, whilst root colonization displayed significant seasonal variation in grassland, scrub and secondary forest, but not in mature forest. The data suggest that (1) different plant functional groups display different relationships with AM fungi, influencing their abundance differentially; (2) plant species from early successional phases are more susceptible to AM root colonization and maintain higher AM sporulation than late successional species; (3) fine root traits and nutrient status influence these AM fungal attributes; and (4) higher AM spore production and root colonization is associated with the season of higher light incidence and temperature, abundant water in soil and higher plant metabolic activity. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Tropical forests are experiencing an increase in the proportion of secondary forests as a result of the balance between the widespread harvesting of old-growth forests and the regeneration in abandoned areas. The impacts of such a process on biodiversity are poorly known and intensely debated. Recent reviews and multi-taxa studies indicate that species replacement in wildlife assemblages is a consistent pattern, sometimes stronger than changes in diversity, with a replacement from habitat generalists to old-growth specialists being commonly observed during tropical forest regeneration. However, the ecological drivers of such compositional changes are rarely investigated, despite its importance in assessing the conservation value of secondary forests, and to support and guide management techniques for restoration. By sampling 28 sites in a continuous Atlantic forest area in Southeastern Brazil, we assessed how important aspects of habitat structure and food resources for wildlife change across successional stages, and point out hypotheses on the implications of these changes for wildlife recovery. Old-growth areas presented a more complex structure at ground level (deeper leaf litter, and higher woody debris volume) and higher fruit availability from an understorey palm, whereas vegetation connectivity, ground-dwelling arthropod biomass, and total fruit availability were higher in earlier successional stages. From these results we hypothetize that generalist species adapted to fast population growth in resource-rich environments should proliferate and dominate earlier successional stages, while species with higher competitive ability in resource-limited environments, or those that depend on resources such as palm fruits, on higher complexity at the ground level, or on open space for flying, should dominate older-growth forests. Since the identification of the drivers of wildlife recovery is crucial for restoration strategies, it is important that future work test and further develop the proposed hypotheses. We also found structural and functional differences between old-growth forests and secondary forests with more than 80. years of regeneration, suggesting that restoration strategies may be crucial to recover structural and functional aspects expected to be important for wildlife in much altered ecosystems, such as the Brazilian Atlantic forest. © 2012 Elsevier B.V..

AB  - Phytosociological studies based on sampling have been very common in the last 20 years, however, they are rarely carried out using complete enumeration of trees (census). This research compare the phytossociological parameters between three different strata from a remnant of Ombrophylous Mixed Forest (OMF), which are: OMF Montana, Border OMF Montana and OMF Alluvial. The area of 13.71 was topographically divided in blocks of 50 x 50 meters for a better control of the 100% forest inventory (census). All trees with CBH (circumference measured at 1,30 m above ground) ≥ 31,5 centimeters were measured, georeferencied, numbered, painted at DBH and identified at species level. In the strata OMF Montana the species with the highest Value of Coverage (VC) was Araucaria angustifolia, with 30.6%, followed by Casearia sylvestris with 25.8%. In the Border OMF Montana the species that succeeded Araucaria angustifolia (29.0%) was Gochnatia polymorpha with 27.2% of VC. The third strata, OMF Alluvial, presented as predominant species Schinus terebinthifolius (55,5%), followed by Sebastiania commersoniana (27,7%), both characteristics of alluvial environments. In the three strata there was prevalence of secondary pioneer species, proving that the area is in a secondary stage of ecological succession due to past exploratory process.

AB  - Urban forests are an important component of the landscape, being responsible for the conservation of biodiversity in the cities. This study aimed to analyse the phytosociological structure of regenerating tree species in a small urban (2 ha) semideciduous seasonal forest fragment at Juiz de Fora, MG, Brazil. The survey was done on 25 plots of 5 x 5 m, where all the individuals with diameter at breast height (DBH) < 5 cm and height > 1 m were sampled. The number of individuals found was 1066, belonging to 71 species with the predominance of 'pioneiras' (47% of species and 69% of individuals). The most representative species were Myrcia splendens, Anadenanthera colubrina, Vismia guianensis, Miconia theizans and the exotic invasive Syzygium jambos, which together amounted 40.5% of the total value of importance. The Shannon diversity index was 3.17 nats. ind-1 and Pielou equability index was 0.74, indicating the existence of an ecological dominance. The detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) detected the presence of strong floristic gradient, associating some shading species (Anadenanthera colubrina and Piptadenia gonoacantha) with exotic Coffea arabica. Even with 70 years of natural regeneration, the results indicated a regenerating community with difficulties of progression to advanced successional stages.

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to document the males of Leioproctus rosellae Gonzalez in Gonzalez & Florez, 2011 (Colletidae, Paracolletini) and Heriades tayrona Gonzalez & Griswold, 2011 (Megachilidae, Osmiini), two solitary bee species recently described based on females from the Caribbean coast of Colombia. Leioproctus rosellae is currently known only from the holotype, while H. tayrona is known from a few specimens from the type locality. The discovery of these species in northern Colombia considerably extended the distribution of Leioproctus Smith (sensu Michener, 2007) and Heriades Spinola in the Western Hemisphere. In the Americas, Leioproctus was known from Chile and Argentina to central Peru and northeastern Brazil, while Heriades was known from southern Canada to Panama and the Greater Antilles (Michener 2007). The discovery of H. tayrona also represented the first record of the tribe Osmiini for South America. The specimens described herein were collected by sweep netting bushes along banks near the city of Santa Marta, Magdalena, Colombia (see below). The sampling area was characterized by small fragments of dry forests among abandoned pastures and secondary vegetation. Viguiera mucronata S.F. Blake (Asteraceae) was the predominant plant in bloom. Specimens are deposited in the Instituto de Ciencias Naturales (ICN), Universidad Nacional de Colombia, Bogotá, Colombia, and in the Snow Entomological Collection (SEMC), Division of Entomology, University of Kansas Natural History Museum, Lawrence, Kansas, USA. Morphological terminology follows that of Engel (2001) and Michener (2007), except for torulus herein used instead of antennal alveolus. Measurements were taken using an ocular micrometer.

AB  - The Bananal Plain spreading on the Middle Araguaia River basin in Central Brazil at the Cerrado-Amazonia ecotone is a unique system that sustains the largest seasonal wetlands of the Cerrado biome. The huge Bananal Plain is an intracratonic sedimentary basin filled with Pleistocene sediments of the Araguaia formation. Covering approximately two million hectares, the Bananal Island is a major geomorphologic feature of the Bananal plain. Fieldwork and the analysis of a temporal series of MODIS-VI and Landsat ETM images allowed us to discriminate Cerrado phyto-physiognomies on the Bananal Island. Maps of vegetation and geomorphologic units were created, and from the correlation between landforms and vegetation types we identified morpho-vegetation units.Our approach allowed us to postulate that Pleistocene landforms strongly influence, if not dominate, the distribution of vegetation units.For example, the distribution of current gallery forest is not only controlled by active floodplains, but also by alluvial belts abandoned by avulsion. Additionally, arboreal Cerrado vegetation is supported by laterite developed on the sediments of the Araguaia Formation. Some of these inactive landforms are in part modified by the present day geomorphologic processes and colonized by successional vegetation that varies from alluvial forest to Cerrado.Characterized by a very flat landscape with a hindered drainage, the muddy sediments of the Araguaia Formation and the high seasonal rainfall favor the development of regional seasonal wetlands.The Bananal plain is a key area for understanding the Quaternary climatic and biogeographic changes in tropical South America. The control exerted by relict Quaternary landforms on the current vegetation units demonstrates the strong links between geomorphologic aspects of the landscape and ecological patterns. This multidisciplinary approach provides a better understanding of the biogeographic patterns in the Cerrado-Amazon ecotone, which is useful for identifying and designing areas for conservation. © 2013.

AB  - To estimate the risk of population decline for the threatened palm species Butia eriospatha, we investigated the patterns of demography, natural regeneration, herbivory, and the levels of genetic diversity using 9 microsatellite loci from both adults and seedlings sampled from 4 populations in Southern Brazil (n = 330). Our results indicate that cattle grazing in B. eriospatha population areas severely affect their demographic structure. Three B. eriospatha populations showed a bimodal age structure made up of adult plants and seedlings and high rates (>77%) of livestock herbivory. For 1 population, we describe and quantify for the first time the occurrence of 6 ontogenetic stages for this threatened palm species. Populations of B. eriospatha showed high levels of genetic differentiation (F ST adult plants = 0.287, FST seedlings = 0.175). The amount of observed heterozygosity differed significantly between small (H O = 0.329) and large populations (HO = 0.461), indicating that small populations can be more susceptible to genetic drift. With no recruitment and a mortality rate of 2.0%, we show that the populations investigated in this study would be at an extremely high risk of local extinction, with a greater than 50% reduction in the effective population size, in the next 40 years. Although this study highlights the importance of analyzing both population ecology parameters and genetic data to better understand the level of risk facing threatened species, we emphasize that policy actions are urgently needed for effective conservation of this vulnerable biological resource. © 2013 The American Genetic Association 2013.

AB  - If logging and forest multiple-use are to be compatible with biodiversity conservation, then forest structure, composition and diversity must be expected to recover from the disturbance and eventually return to their former levels. Here we evaluate the long-term effects of selective logging and forest multiple-use on Southern Brazilian subtropical Araucaria mixed conifer-hardwood forest resilience at the landscape-scale. Long-term effects of different management regimes were compared between control undisturbed forests and forest stands subjected to early (55 years before this study) and recent (13 years) selective logging followed by undisturbed postharvest periods, and forest fragments subjected to selective logging followed by unregulated multiple-use by private landowners. Forest structure (tree density, basal area and height, and regeneration density) in early-logged areas was indistinguishable from control areas. Fragmentation and chronic disturbance, however, degraded forest fragments and kept them at early successional stages, with higher tree density, reduced basal area and scarce or absent regeneration. Mixed forests showed compositional resilience in the angiosperm component but not in the conifer component. Chronic disturbance kept forest fragments floristically away from mature and undisturbed secondary forests. Species richness in control and recently-logged plots did not differ significantly and was higher than richness in early-logged plots. Species richness was much reduced in degraded forest fragments. Density of the conifer Araucaria angustifolia, characteristic of the mature forest, was reduced in the fragments and in logged stands. We discuss how native forest management practices can be implemented to contribute positively to the conservation of the Araucaria mixed forest biodiversity. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - The encroachment of the logging frontier into Western Amazonia, where non-timber extraction has historically driven regional economies, provides an opportunity to explore the practice of multiple-use forest management. Families are now harvesting timber in their Brazil nut (. Bertholletia excelsa)-rich community-titled forests, and we examined effects of formal and informal logging (with and without government-approved management plans, respectively) on forest disturbance and natural regeneration (individuals ≤10. cm. dbh) of B. excelsa and 10 timber species in Northern Bolivia. B. excelsa regeneration densities 2-5. years after timber harvests did not differ between unlogged or logged (formally nor informally) sites; densities were, however, greater in larger logging disturbances (i.e., log landings vs skid trails), corroborating our model in which canopy openness explained regeneration densities. Regeneration of the two most valuable timber species, Swietenia macrophylla and Amburana cearensis, rarely occurred, and only where conspecific trees were felled, implying that population recovery of selected species may need post-harvest silvicultural interventions. In contrast, two other high-value timber species (. Cedrela odorata and Dipteryx odorata) responded favorably to disturbances. Contrary to our expectations and reported industrial-scale findings, formal logging resulted in a larger percentage, but still acceptable level, of disturbed area than informal logging (10.6%. ±. 0.65 SE vs 6.9%. ±. 1.26 SE; p=. 0.047).Our overall finding that Brazil nut regeneration was unaffected by low logging intensities suggests that combined Brazil nut and timber harvests are compatible under certain circumstances. Still, adhering to legal requirements has been challenging for individual landholders. Preparing legally-required management plans without assistance is difficult, and individual landholders seek to harvest timber over multiple years, which is discouraged by formal logging that indirectly entails one-time extraction of nearly all commercial stems from the approximately 200. ha of forest landholders dedicate to timber production. Thus, reconciliation of legal requirements with community conditions is fundamental to long-term success of multiple-use forest management. © 2012 Elsevier B.V..

AB  - This article aims to characterize horizontal and diameter structure of a managed forest using graphic expression techniques. Data for this research is result of complete forest inventory (census) carried out from a block of 800 hectares, before and after selective cutting, inside Tapajós National Forest, located in the Municipality of Belterra, State of Pará, Brazil. The analysis revealed that, in relation to horizontal structure, intense cutting resulted in changes of different levels mainly to phytosociological frequency of some species, such as, Manilkara huberi, Carapa guianensis and Tabebuia serratifolia. The diameter structure of some species, such as Sextonia rubra and Dipteryx odorata, revealed changes after selective cutting under technically acceptable rates, because the stock levels of some diameter classes surpassed the limits of balance observed for polycyclic systems with silviculture based on natural regeneration. The inclusion of graphics in the harvest operating plan for the 10 most important species listed in forest management, that is, before and after selective cutting, would lead to the desirable structure maintenance.

AB  - Climbers are highly represented in several vegetation types, corresponding to nearly 25% of tropical forest taxonomic diversity, but they are very poorly represented in floristic surveys. Studies of dense ombrophilous forests are rare and this work aims at contributing to the knowledge of climbers in this plant formation. The survey was undertaken in the Serra da Tiririca State Park, located between Niterói and Maricá municipalities, Rio de Janeiro state. The floristic survey listed 38 families, 107 genera, and 215 species. Leguminosae (with 29 species), Sapindaceae (23), Bignoniaceae (22), Malpighiaceae (19), and Apocynaceae (15) are the families better represented in number of species, accounting for 50.5 % of the total number of species reported. Woody, twining climbers predominated in the inventory. The high number of species found is possibly related to a mosaic of vegetation in different successional stages resulted from the process of use and abandonment of land. © 2018 Instituto de Pesquisas Jardim Botanico do Rio de Janeiro.All right reserved.

AB  - Rural-urban migration can have both positive and negative environmental consequences for tropical forests. Rural residents exert pressure on the environment through farming, fishing, and forest extraction, yet conversely, protecting rural livelihoods is often the motivation for conserving large areas of threatened forest. This research examines rural settlement within the Brazilian Amazon to shed light on the drivers of on-going rural exodus and its environmental implications. Specifically, we examine the relative importance of public service provision and natural resources in determining settlement patterns along, and rural-urban migration from, eight rivers in road-less regions of the Brazilian Amazon. Data include biophysical, social, and economic variables that were assessed in 184 riverine settlements along rural-urban gradients up to 740 km from the nearest urban center. Settlements were smaller upstream, and lacked key services such as schools and healthcare. We found that clustering of rural populations close to urban centers reflects the high costs of living in remote areas, despite abundant natural resources which previously justified migration to headwaters. Impeded dry-season navigability and transport costs restricted the flow of goods and services to and from remote areas, and transaction costs of trade exchange were higher upstream. A lack of school access was the main motivation for rural-urban migration and the abandonment of remote riverine settlements. A key policy implication is that while education services could provide a powerful tool to stabilize and support rural populations, delivery is challenging in remote areas and may also encourage further rural-urban migration in the longer term. Furthermore, river-dwellers in remote areas rarely visited remote urban centers, presumably because these journeys are too costly. We examine the implications of our findings for anti-poverty subsidies and payment for ecosystem services and conclude that transport costs required to receive payment could encourage further depopulation of remote areas. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

AB  - Diversity and patterns of spatial distribution of species of natural regeneration in São Francisco de Paula, RS, Brazil. This work aimed the analysis of floristic diversity and spatial distribution of species of natural regeneration in an area of Mixed Rainy Forest in the National Forest of São Francisco de Paula, RS, comparing different diversity and dispersion indexes. The vegetation sampling was performed by analyzing 180 subunits of 10 m x 10 m, with all the individuals taller than 1.30 m and with breast height circumference from 3.0 cm to the limit of 29.9 cm, considered as natural regeneration. The parameters of frequency and density, dispersion indexes of MacGuinnes, Fracker and Brischle and Payandeh, and different alpha indexes of diversity were calculated. The dispersion indexes revealed the same behavior for the species, which are aggregated or presented a tendency to cluster. Margalef index was underestimated, possibly influenced by the size of sample unit. The Menhinick and Shannon indexes represented the diversity in a very real form, even in small sampling units. The indexes of Simpson and MacIntosh denoted low dominance and the equity indexes revealed high uniformity in species.

AB  - This study was a survey of eusocial wasps in fragments of Atlantic Rain Forest with different stages of regeneration. To capture the wasps, we used bait traps during the period from 2006 to 2009. During this period 369 social wasps were collected, constituting ten species belonging to four genera. In order to compare these three areas ecological indexes were calculated. Fragments with natural regeneration or restoration program showed the greatest diversity of wasps, being Epiponini wasps the most frequent collected individuals. Some wasp species were more tolerant to disturbance than others. Furthermore, climatic factors affected the presence of wasps in all the fragments, increasing the number of individuals at the summer and autumn where occur the highest temperatures and levels of precipitation. These results explain the importance of natural corridors in adjacent areas with different levels of regeneration.

AB  - In tropical systems, habitat heterogeneity and resource availability have been reported as important factors driving ant species richness and composition. For this reason, these variables have been widely used as indicators of forest disturbance. The aim of this study was to compare the composition and richness of arboreal ants between the dry and wet seasons in three successional stages of a tropical dry forest at the Parque Estadual da Mata Seca, northern Minas Gerais state, Brazil. Ant sampling was performed in 15 plots in three different forest secondary stages: early, intermediate and late. Ants were sampled during the wet and dry seasons, using five pitfall traps per plot. We collected 43 ant species, distributed in 19 genera. Our results indicated a change on ant species composition along the successional gradient (p < 0.05). However, ant species richness did not differ between stages and seasons (p > 0.05) and was not affected by the variables used here as surrogates to habitat heterogeneity (tree richness) and resource availability (tree density) (p > 0.05). Ant composition did not change significantly between the dry and wet seasons for the early successional stage, but plots from the intermediate and late stages were clearly segregated according to seasons. We suggest that it is likely that 25 years of forest regeneration are enough to restore most of the arboreal ant communities in tropical dry forests, strengthening the importance of secondary habitats to biodiversity maintenance.

AB  - The process of secondary succession on degraded lands in the Amazon depends on their land-use histories. In this scenario, little is known about how animal communities respond to different types of secondary vegetation in the region. We examined the effects of abandoned cattle pasture, Vismia- and Cecropia-dominated regrowth on the abundance of bat species and community composition in the Central Amazon, Brazil, based on 11 netting sites and on landscape characteristics. We captured 1444 bats, representing 26 species and two families (Phyllostomidae and Mormoopidae). Among the six most-captured Phyllostomidae bats, Sturnira lilium and Sturnira tildae had significantly higher capture rates in abandoned pasture, while Rhinophylla pumilio predominated in both Vismia- and Cecropia-dominated regrowth. An hybrid multidimensional scaling ordination revealed significant differences in the bat community among the three types of secondary vegetation. Phyllostominae bats were more common and richer in the less-disturbed areas of Cecropia-dominated regrowth, while Stenodermatinae species were more captured in abandoned pastures. Our results suggest that the type of secondary vegetation, together with its land-use history, affects bat community composition in the Central Amazon. The Phyllostominae subfamily (gleaning animalivores) was habitat selective and disappeared from areas experiencing constant disturbances. On the other hand, Stenodermatinae frugivorous bats often used and foraged in altered areas. We suggest that secondary vegetations in more-advanced successional stages can be used to augment the total area protected by forest conservation units. © 2009 The Authors.

AB  - The Upper Parana Atlantic Forest, as with other areas, has been modified due to anthropogenic activities, generating a mosaic of agricultural fields and forests of varying ages and levels of conservation. The objective of this study was to identify structural and floristic patterns in secondary forests generated in abandoned fields with varying historic uses. Changes in vegetation were surveyed using chronosequences from 2 to 70 years. Stands with different land use histories in three areas of northern Misiones, Argentina, were considered. Adults (DBH ≥ 10 cm), saplings (3 ≥ DBH < 10 cm), seedlings (DBH < 3 cm and height ≥ 50 cm) and non-arboreous vegetation (herbaceous plants and shrubs) were surveyed. Data was analyzed using multivariate techniques (TWINSPAN, Detrended Correspondence Analysis, Cluster Analysis, and Kruskal-Wallis test). In the floristic analysis, two main forest groups were identified: one made up of primary forest and oldest secondary forest (>20 years), and another of the youngest secondary forests (<20 years). Basal area and density of individuals (seedlings, saplings, and adults) rapidly increased during the first two decades, and subsequently the adult category reached values comparable to those of mature forests (32 m2/ha and 850 individuals/ha). During the early years of succession, the forests showed floristic and structural differences related to history of use previous to abandonment; abandoned annual crops showed the greatest densities of saplings and seedlings, while abandoned pastures presented only individuals in the seedling category, and at very low densities. In stands analyzed since the beginning of succession, species of several ecological groups were present (pioneer, initial secondary, late secondary), while climax species appeared only in the seedling category, and in abandoned pastures no species of the later groups were recorded. Our results suggest that differences recorded during the early years of regeneration in sites with varying historic uses may be generated mainly by remnant vegetation at the time of abandonment of the fields (grasses and remnant monoculture plants). After 20 years of succession, it was no longer possible to differentiate the forests structurally or floristically, regardless of age or historic use of each stand. Due to their rapid regeneration capacity, the forests studied play an important role from the start of the successional process in heterogeneous anthropogenic landscapes such as that of Misiones, and contribute to maintaining biodiversity while providing numerous environmental services. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Population structure and dynamics of the black-cheeked gnateater (Conopophaga melanops) were studied at Salto Morato Nature Reserve, in Paran, southern Brazil, from October 2006 to September 2007. Territory size and population density, breeding season (timing and length), reproductive success and annual survival rates were estimated from sightings of 18 marked adult birds and the success of 18 nesting attempts. The black-cheeked gnateater is socially monogamous and territorial, with a breeding-season length of approximately 3 mo beginning in early October. Predation caused most nest failures, nest survival was 0.96 d-1 and apparent annual nesting success was 22%, resulting in annual productivity of 0.36 individuals per adult. Apparent adult annual survival was ∼0.44 y-1. Seventy-five per cent of fledglings survived at least 2 mo after fledging. Two methods of estimating population growth rate suggest very different rates: r = -0.04 (∼ stable), or varies between 0.475-0.616 (declining). Yet, low apparent adult survival suggests that territories are not permanent, perhaps abandoned after nest failure. We find that by estimating population growth, even in short-term studies, testable hypotheses can be generated that will allow better understanding of population dynamics.

AB  - Amazonian communities have the potential for improving their livelihoods by efficiently managing their forest resources. However, there is limited understanding of how communities are managing their forests in the dynamic Amazon frontier. This issue was studied in four areas in Bolivia, Brazil and Peru. The most common approach to forest management was found to be informal timber rights negotiations between communities and logging companies. Much less common was community forest management (CFM) for timber extraction supported by NGOs. Case studies revealed that stocks of commercial timber species were depleted by logging companies in only a few years in the logged areas, while CFM initiatives planned rotational cycles but were abandoned when external support ceased. Families received limited financial benefits from both loggers (cash income USs 1.18/m3 and US$ 28.14/day) and CFM initiatives (cash income USs 12.57/m3 and USs 8.69/day). A critical debate on the real potential of these approaches to timber extraction needs to take place.

AB  - A juvenile common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) was attacked by a whitetail lancehead viper (Bothrops leucurus) while playing with other group members close to the ground at a site in northeastern Brazil. The attack was almost immediately fatal, but the viper was unable to ingest the body of the marmoset. After approximately 10 min, during which it attempted to swallow the marmoset a number of times, the viper moved away, abandoning the body. While raptors are the principal predators of callitrichids, this record reinforces the relative vulnerability of these primates to snakes in comparison with other platyrrhines, although the small number of recorded events precludes a more definitive analysis of the phenomenon. © 2011 Japan Monkey Centre and Springer.

AB  - The objective of this work was to assess the fine-root (≤2 mm diameter) production dynamics of two forest re-growths at different ages. Fine-root production was monitored by the in growth core method in one 18-year-old site (2 ha) and one 10-year-old site (0.5 ha), both localized in the Apeú region, Northern Pará State, Brazil. The sites were abandoned after successive shifting cultivation, beginning in 1940. Monthly production of live fine-root was similar between sites and was influenced by rainfall seasonality, with higher production during the dry season than the wet season for mass and length. However, mortality in terms of mass was higher in the 10-year-old site than in the 18-year-old site. The seasonality influenced mortality only in the 18-year old site following the pattern observed for live fine-root. The influence seasonal on mortality in terms of length was different between sites, with higher mortality during the wet season in the 10-year-old site and higher mortality during the dry season in the 18-year-old site. Specific root length was higher during the wet season and at the 10-year-old site. Fine-root production was not influenced by the chronosequence of the sites studied, probably fine-root production may have already stabilized in the sites or it depended more on climate and soil conditions. The production of fine-roots mass and length were indicators that generally showed the same pattern.

AB  - The study was developed in a Atlantic Forest fragment called "Mata da Conceição", which presents evident characteristics of the atrophic pressure on its resources, several small glades and trails throughout its area, situated in Catende, Pernambuco, Brazil, aiming at evaluating the total natural regeneration, diversity and structure of the tree species in the fragment. For the natural regeneration estimate of the tree species, 13 samples of 25 m2 were systematically plotted (5 × 5 m). The study was developed with individuals that presented CBH ≤ 15 cm and height ≥ 1.0 m. The heights were divided into three categories: 1 - individuals with 1.0 ≤ h ≤ 2.0 m; 2 - 2.0 < h ≤ 3.0 m; and 3 - individuals with h > 3 m. The study of the sufficient sample showed that 13 plots (325 m2) were satisfactory in representing the floristic composition of the area. A total of 134 live individuals, belonging to 21 botanical families and 43 tree species, were sampled. The highest value for total natural regeneration was observed in the species Eschweilera ovata (Camb.) Miers., with 11.57%, showing a good regeneration capacity in the fragment, helping in the forest structure and physiognomy management.

AB  - The critically endangered black-faced lion tamarin, Leontopithecus caissara, has a restricted geographical distribution consisting of small mainland and island populations, each with distinct habitats in coastal southeastern Brazil. Necessary conservation management actions require an assessment of whether differences in habitats are reflected in use of space by the species. We studied two tamarin groups on the mainland at São Paulo state between August 2005 and March 2007, and compared the results with data from Superagui Island. Three home range estimators were used: minimum convex polygon (MCP), Kernel, and the new technique presented dissolved monthly polygons (DMP). These resulted, respectively, in home ranges of 345, 297, and 282ha for the 12-month duration of the study. Spatial overlap of mainland groups was extensive, whereas temporal overlap was not, a pattern that indicates resource partitioning is an important strategy to avoid intraspecific competition. L. caissara large home ranges seem to be dynamic, with constant incorporation of new areas and abandonment of others through time. The main difference between mainland and island groups is the amount and variety of sleeping sites. A better understanding of the home range sizes, day range lengths, and territorial behavior of this species will aid in developing better management strategies for its protection. Additionally, the presented DMP protocol is a useful improvement over the MCP method as it results in more realistic home range sizes for wildlife species. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the floristic, the successional classification and the dispersion syndromes of the arboreal component in an Atlantic Forest remnant. The area is located in Engenho e DestilariaDourado in Moreno, Pernambuco, Brazil. Fifteen plots of 10 × 25 m for the adult component (CBH e" 15 cm) and 15subplots of 1 × 25 m for the regeneration (CBH ≤ 15 cm and H ≥ 1 m) were located. The sampled individuals were classified into family, genus and specie, and the species classified for the succecional group (pioneers, early secondary and late secondary) and the dispersion syndrome (anemocorous, autochorous and zoochorous). Four hundred and forty-four adult individuals and 407 regenerants, belonging to 31 families, 47 genera and76 species, were sampled. The families with the highest species richness were Melastomataceae and Myrtaceae. This fragment is in early succession, since 82% of the species are pioneers or early secondary. The dispersion predominant was the zoochorous. The knowledge of the species presents in these areas, as well as the succession stage and the dispersion syndrome, is of utmost importance in the development of conservation and restoration intervention of these areas in the Atlantic Forest.

AB  - 1. Agricultural intensification reduces ecological resilience of land-use systems, whereas paradoxically, environmental change and climate extremes require a higher response capacity than ever. Adaptation strategies to environmental change include maintenance of shade trees in tropical agroforestry, but conversion of shaded to unshaded systems is common practice to increase short-term yield. 2. In this paper, we review the short-term and long-term ecological benefits of shade trees in coffee Coffea arabica, C. canephora and cacao Theobroma cacao agroforestry and emphasize the poorly understood, multifunctional role of shade trees for farmers and conservation alike. 3. Both coffee and cacao are tropical understorey plants. Shade trees in agroforestry enhance functional biodiversity, carbon sequestration, soil fertility, drought resistance as well as weed and biological pest control. However, shade is needed for young cacao trees only and is less important in older cacao plantations. This changing response to shade regime with cacao plantation age often results in a transient role for shade and associated biodiversity in agroforestry. 4. Abandonment of old, unshaded cacao in favour of planting young cacao in new, thinned forest sites can be named 'short-term cacao boom-and-bust cycle', which counteracts tropical forest conservation. In a 'long-term cacao boom-and-bust cycle', cacao boom can be followed by cacao bust due to unmanageable pest and pathogen levels (e.g. in Brazil and Malaysia). Higher pest densities can result from physiological stress in unshaded cacao and from the larger cacao area planted. Risk-averse farmers avoid long-term vulnerability of their agroforestry systems by keeping shade as an insurance against insect pest outbreaks, whereas yield-maximizing farmers reduce shade and aim at short-term monetary benefits. 5. Synthesis and applications. Sustainable agroforestry management needs to conserve or create a diverse layer of multi-purpose shade trees that can be pruned rather than removed when crops mature. Incentives from payment-for-ecosystem services and certification schemes encourage farmers to keep high to medium shade tree cover. Reducing pesticide spraying protects functional agrobiodiversity such as antagonists of pests and diseases, pollinating midges determining cacao yields and pollinating bees enhancing coffee yield. In a landscape perspective, natural forest alongside agroforestry allows noncrop-crop spillover of a diversity of functionally important organisms. Knowledge transfer between farmers, agronomists and ecologists in a participatory approach helps to encourage a shade management regime that balances economic and ecological needs and provides a 'diversified food-and-cash crop' livelihood strategy. © 2011 The Authors.

AB  - Although commercial forest plantations have been termed "green deserts", several studies from the last two decades have reported the opposite. These studies suggest that forest plantations can catalyze the natural regeneration in their understory and, thus, contribute to biodiversity conservation. In order to obtain a wide and multi-faceted panorama of forest plantations and their potential contribution to biodiversity conservation and forest restoration, previous studies investigating natural regeneration under forest plantations have been reviewed, highlighting those carried out in Brazil. Methods and environmental conditions are quite variable among studies, making generalizations difficult. Nevertheless, results indicate that historical and environmental factors, such as canopy density and light availability, plantation age, forest species, distance from natural forests, silvicultural practices, and previous land use directly or indirectly affect natural regeneration richness, abundance and community structure under forest plantations. The reviewed studies, as a whole, reinforce the idea that commercial forest plantations can act as environments of biodiversity, at least for some life forms, and, in addition, can facilitate the restoration of native forests. Although the Brazilian studies are abundant, they have been restricted to a few regions and biomes and are mostly descriptive studies. Experimental studies focusing on specific factors that affect the natural regeneration dynamic under forest plantations as well as on management techniques in order to combine high production and biodiversity conservation are desirable. Nonetheless, other biomes and regions rather than those already studied, where forest plantation is a common land use, should be considered.

AB  - There has been an increasing number of articles stressing the advantage of applying remote sensing products of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) for rapidly enhancing the volume of geological data in Amazonian areas, where forest cover is dense and high, clouds are abundant and accessibility is limited. The majority of these studies has emphasized geomorphology as a tool for both discussing tectonic reactivations during the Cenozoic and reconstructing Quaternary paleolandscapes. This work applies Digital Elevation Model (DEM) derived from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) for delineating past morphological features under dense rainforest in an Amazonian lowland area. Previous use of this tool in southwestern Marajó Island (northern Brazil) helped to delineate, with exceptional precision, a paleochannel network hidden under the rainforest, which would be barely detected with other available remote sensing products. Fieldwork revealed that these paleochannels are related to palimpsest drainage systems developed mostly during the last 40,000 14C yr B.P. Measured altitudes acquired during topographic surveys attested that paleochannel areas are slightly higher than adjacent floodplains. This fact determined the successful application of SRTM-DEM for mapping paleochannels in Marajó Island. Integration of SRTM data with sedimentological information collected during fieldwork suggests paleoflows derived from continental areas located to south of the study area. This paleodrainage was active when the island was still connected to mainland. With island detachment due to reactivation of tectonic faults, the channels became abandoned and were progressively forested. The results obtained in the present study indicate that SRTM-DEM has high potential for unraveling similar morphological features from many other Amazonian areas with low topography and a dense forest cover. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The role played by abandoned nests of leaf-cutting ants (Atta spp.) as a small-scale disturbance regime that affects plant recruitment, species coexistence and forest regeneration remains poorly investigated. Here we examine whether abandoned nests of Atta cephalotes serve as regeneration niches and operate as particular plant recruitment habitats, favouring forest regeneration after ant activities cease and leading to the establishment of taxonomically/ecologically distinct plant assemblages. Soil properties, canopy openness, light availability and regenerating plant assemblages were evaluated across 18 nests and adjacent control plots in a large remnant of Atlantic Forest in north-east Brazil from December 2004 to December 2005. Surprisingly, nests and control plots exhibited very similar light environments irrespective of nest age, but nest soils exhibited substantial reductions in carbon content (1.45±0.24 vs. 1.79±0.13%) and organic matter (2.50±0.41 vs. 3.08±0.23%), and proved to be much more resistant to penetration (30.57±6.08 vs. 39.48±7.53mm). Functional signature of regenerating plant assemblages exhibited little variation across both habitat types, as they were dominated by pioneer, small-seeded and vertebrate-dispersed species. However, abandoned nests exhibited less dense, impoverished and more homogeneous regenerating plant assemblages at local and landscape scale; they clearly lacked nest-dependent plant species and represented floristic subsets of the flora inhabiting the undisturbed forest. This recruitment bottleneck was transient in the long term because nest-related effects ameliorated in older nests. Our results suggest that, unlike treefall gaps, abandoned nests represent temporary (relatively long-lasting) islands of unsuitable substrate that reduce plant recruitment, retard forest regeneration, and fail in providing a special regeneration niche able to promote species coexistence and plant diversity. © 2010 The Authors.

AB  - In this paper we analyzes the PALSAR polarimetric signatures and scattering mechanisms of tropical forest typologies based on target decomposition. At the representation of polarimetric signatures, the crosssection of the forest target (σ) was plotted on a threedimensional graphic as a function of the orientation angle, ellipticity angle and the intensity of co-polar components of the radar signal. The analysis of scattering mechanisms was done by the association of entropy and mean alpha angle values for each sample, introduced to the bi-dimensional classification space. Some results can be mentioned: (a) from the analysis of signatures one can verify that the secondary succession stages present a relatively high pedestal when compared to the forested sections; (b) the pixel distribution in the (H) bi-dimensional space was more frequent at zones 4, 5 and 9 for forest with or without timber exploitation and for the advanced secondary succession. This study improves the understanding of the interaction mechanisms between L-band PALSAR signals and structural parameters, subsidizing the forest inventory in the Brazilian Amazon region.

AB  - This study was developed between October 2009 and September 2010 in an urban fragment of Atlantic Florest, Parque Metropolitano de Pituaçu (PMP), Salvador, BA. The objective was to identify potential dispersers of seeds, as well as species of plants that can have great importance in maintaining the community of birds that occur in this park. A further objective was to identify seasonal variations between mutual interactions. In order to register the interactions, a track of 2 km had been crossed on a weekly basis. When a feeding event was observed, the behavior used by the bird to remove and ingest the fruits was registered. Twenty-two species of birds were observed consuming fruits. However, one of them was considered a predator (Sporophila nigricollis), resulting in 17 species of birds present in the mutualism network. Twenty-seven species of plants had their fruits consumed. Of those, five species had their predated fruits or pulp consumed. Tangara palmarum was the most remarkable bird, consuming four times more fruits that any another and reaching the highest index of importance (Ij = 0.208). Among the species of plants, Miconia minutiflora (Melastomataceae) reached the greater index of importance (Ij = 0.246) and together with Didymopanax morototoni constituted 50.27% of the interactions. The second highest index of importance was reached by Pera glabrata (Ij = 0.154). It was registered in spring, and the largest amount of fruit was consumed from that species. The results of this study reinforce the importance of activities carried out by small size generalist birds, particularly in seed dispersion within much altered forest fragments. This is fundamental in accelerating the mechanisms of natural regeneration.

AB  - We present a review of more than 30 years of ecological restoration in the Brazilian part of the Atlantic Forest. Based on what has been done in this biome, we try to summarize the main findings and challenges for restoration in this highly threatened forest biome. We found that many past experiences did not result in self-perpetuating forests, for different reasons. Currently, most projects aim to construct self-sustaining communities and no longer see restoration as a deterministic process. We also found that the reconstruction of permanent forest with high diversity is feasible but it depends on the strategies applied and on the surrounding landscape. Although many new techniques have been created (e.g. seed rain management or promotion of natural regeneration), the most used one in the Atlantic Forest is still the planting of many native species from different functional groups. Native species are largely used and perform well even in highly disturbed environments. Today, many projects are trying to produce thousands of hectares of permanent forests and many technical advances are about to be incorporated. But restoration also faces some main challenges to become an effective and widespread means of conserving the Atlantic Forest which are, namely, reducing costs, planning restoration actions at landscape-level, and conforming to socio-political issues. The socio-political tools to overcome such barriers in practice have yet to be developed. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Natural regeneration in eucalyptus stands, as well as forest plantations that combine eucalyptus and native species, have been monitored in rural areas in the north-west of Paraná State, Brazil. Such forest systems involving eucalyptus represent an alternative for forest recovery and regeneration in areas degraded by livestock and intensive agriculture. Furthermore, such plantations offer new economic opportunities for landowners while providing incentives for their compliance with environmental regulations for saving a minimum amount of forested land (Reserva Legal). This study aims to understand the potential of natural vegetation recovery in the understory of Corymbia citriodora stands, due to the context of current environment and land use in the region. Thus, it evaluates floristic composition and vegetation structure in the understory re-growth within such plantation stands, in São Pedro do Paraná (Paraná State). As result, it identified 53 species from natural regeneration at a density of 4725 plants per hectare. Such plants, identified at the species level, were organized accordingly to their ecological group and/or potential uses. The observed structural parameters pointed to a high potential for natural regeneration and growth of vegetation in the understory of C. citriodora, which reveals that, with appropriated management, these species could be used to make native restoration vegetation easer in the region.

AB  - Animal-plant interactions are important for the recovery of diversity and processes in secondary forests, which increasingly dominate the tropical landscape. We used a combination of observational and experimental approaches to study the interactions of ants with diaspores across a successional gradient of forests in Southern Brazil, from August 2007 to April 2008. In addition to diaspore removal rates, we assessed the species richness, diversity and behaviour of ants interacting with diaspores, in three replicated sites of four successional stages of forests. We recorded 22 ant species interacting with diaspores (an estimated 15% of the total species pool in the region). Species richness and diversity did not differ among successional stages but the behaviour of ants towards diaspores changed with the age of secondary forests. In old successional stages the removal of entire diaspores was more common than in young successional stages of forests. Concordantly, diaspore removal rates were lowest in the youngest successional stage of secondary forests and increased with the age of forests. These results indicate that ant-diaspore interactions in secondary forests are disturbed and lower removal rates in secondary forests are likely to constrain the recruitment of plant populations during secondary succession.

AB  - Tree species composition and structure of a 40-year chronosequence of secondary forests was compared with old-growth forests in southern Bahia, Brazil. Twelve stands were randomly selected that represented three age classes: 10, 25, and 40 year old with four replications in each class. All stands selected had been established after abandonment from swidden cultivation and were surrounded by old-growth forests. In every stand, ten 0.01-ha transects were established and all stems (≥5 cm diameter at breast height) were measured and identified. Results were compared with the dataset of two neighboring old-growth sites. Mean diameter, total height, and stand basal area increased with age. Number of trees/ha peaked in 40 year old stands. The results showed that secondary forests in this region take much more than 40 years to recover the structure of old-growth forests. In contrast, species richness recovery was rapid with a continuous accumulation of species with age in secondary forests. Species richness and diversity increased with age as did similarity between secondary stands and old-growth stands. More than half of the species found in the 40 year old stands were shared with the neighboring old-growth forests. However, species richness and diversity were higher in old growth sites. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2009.

AB  - The termites allocate the space and alimentary resources of their habitats with different species or groups of species. As termites are primary consumers, promote the mineralization of nutrients rich in cellulose. The objective of this work was to compare the functional composition of termite species among areas of abandoned pasture and of secondary succession adjacent to the Semideciduous Forest remnants in the Parque Estadual Altamiro de Moura Pacheco, state of Goiás, Brazil. The study area comprised one abandoned pasture, one area in transition from abandoned pasture to forest and one fragment of Semideciduous Forest. The richness of termite species decreased from forest (13) to transition area (9) and to pasture (8). Species that nest and consume humus in the soil were the most common. The termite assemblage of the semideciduous forest remnant presented nesting and trophic habits more diversified than the abandoned pasture and the transition area. Among the 19 species sampled, 12 were recorded in only one area of study. This is the first occurrence of Incisitermes sp. in the "Cerrado" biome and was recorded in the transition area. We concluded that when a pasture is no longer used for cattle, begins a process of succession that can restore the community of species of termite.

AB  - Guibourtia hymenifolia (Moric.) J. Leonard (Fabaceae) is a timber great potential tree species, with occurrence in seasonal deciduous and semideciduous forests in Serra da Bodoquena, Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil. It was described and illustrated in this paper, the morphological aspects of fruit, seeds and development of seedlings and saplings of G. hymenifolia. The fruit is a dehiscent unyspermic legume. The seed is elliptic, orange colored with the presence of whitish funiculus aril. It was obtained 66% of germination in a germination chamber, and the initial morphology of the seedlings was epigeos phanerocotyledonary, with fleshy cotyledons. Seedlings and saplings presented changing of phylotaxis, with two opposite and alternate, petiolate and bifoliolate metaphylls. Eophylls and metaphylls present pinnate, camptodromous, brochidodromous venation pattern. These results can be used to identify the species in taxonomic studies and they allow the identification of seedlings in natural regeneration studies.

AB  - The complex interactions among endangered ecosystems, landowners' interests, and different models of land tenure and use, constitute an important series of challenges for those seeking to maintain and restore biodiversity and augment the flow of ecosystem services. Over the past 10 years, we have developed a data-based approach to address these challenges and to achieve medium and large-scale ecological restoration of riparian areas on private lands in the state of São Paulo, southeastern Brazil. Given varying motivations for ecological restoration, the location of riparian areas within landholdings, environmental zoning of different riparian areas, and best-practice restoration methods were developed for each situation. A total of 32 ongoing projects, covering 527,982. ha, were evaluated in large sugarcane farms and small mixed farms, and six different restoration techniques have been developed to help upscale the effort. Small mixed farms had higher portions of land requiring protection as riparian areas (13.3%), and lower forest cover of riparian areas (18.3%), than large sugarcane farms (10.0% and 36.9%, respectively for riparian areas and forest cover values). In both types of farms, forest fragments required some degree of restoration. Historical anthropogenic degradation has compromised forest ecosystem structure and functioning, despite their high-diversity of native tree and shrub species. Notably, land use patterns in riparian areas differed markedly. Large sugarcane farms had higher portions of riparian areas occupied by highly mechanized agriculture, abandoned fields, and anthropogenic wet fields created by siltation in water courses. In contrast, in small mixed crop farms, low or non-mechanized agriculture and pasturelands were predominant. Despite these differences, plantations of native tree species covering the entire area was by far the main restoration method needed both by large sugarcane farms (76.0%) and small mixed farms (92.4%), in view of the low resilience of target sites, reduced forest cover, and high fragmentation, all of which limit the potential for autogenic restoration. We propose that plantations should be carried out with a high-diversity of native species in order to create biologically viable restored forests, and to assist long-term biodiversity persistence at the landscape scale. Finally, we propose strategies to integrate the political, socio-economic and methodological aspects needed to upscale restoration efforts in tropical forest regions throughout Latin America and elsewhere. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The restoration of anthropogenically disturbed sites contributes to biodiversity conservation, but pre-recovery land-use history affects the restoration and recovery time of impacted forest sites. The objective of the present study was to assess the effects of different land-use histories (low-impact logging - LL, high-impact logging - HL, and slash-and-burn - SB) on quantitative (diversity values) and qualitative (floristic composition) measures of forest recovery. This research was conducted in Atlantic rainforest areas of Bahia State, Brazil, which had remained undisturbed for 50 to 60 years after human disturbance. Surprisingly, the area subjected to the most aggressive usage (SB) showed intermediate richness and diversity values, but had a floristic composition dominated by pioneer species similar to early-successional forests. Families typical of preserved areas (Sapotaceae and Myrtaceae) were more diverse in LL and HL areas. Our results indicate both quantitative and qualitative recovery in areas subjected to LL, which tended to recover without intervention. Areas subjected to HL showed intermediate qualitative recovery and the lowest quantitative recovery, and may therefore require enrichment to accelerate recovery. Despite good quantitative (species richness and diversity) recovery, the slash-and-burn areas had a predominance of early successional species, which indicates that enrichment actions are essential for the recovery of these forest areas. Knowledge of how land-use history influences forest restoration processes can guide management actions and thereby contribute to the allocation of resources where they are really needed. © Larissa Rocha-Santos and Daniela C.

AB  - Throughout the Amazon of Brazil, manioc (Manihot esculenta) is a staple crop produced through slash-and-burn agriculture. Nutrient losses during slash-and-burn can be large and nutrient demand by food crops so great that fields are often abandoned after two years. In recent decades, farmers have reduced the fallow phase from 20 to ~5 years, limiting plant nutrient accumulation to sustain crop yields. Improved fallows through simultaneous planting of trees with food crops may accelerate nutrient re-accumulation. In addition, slash-and-mulch technology may prevent loss of nutrients due to burning and mulch decomposition may serve as a slow-release source of nutrients. This study in Pará, Brazil, in a 7-year-old secondary forest following slashing and mulching of the vegetation, involved two main plot treatments (with and without P and K fertilizers) and two sub-plot treatments (with or without a N2-fixer Inga edulis). A mixed-culture of trees and manioc was planted in all plots. P and K fertilizer increased tree mortality due to weed competition but growth of surviving trees in four of the five tree species tested also increased as did biomass production of manioc. In the N2-fixer treatment trends of greater growth and survival of four of five tree species and manioc biomass were also observed. Fertilization increased the biomass of competing vegetation, but there was a fertilizer by N2-fixer interaction as I. edulis caused a reduction in competing biomass in the fertilized treatment. After one year, fertilization increased decomposition of the mulch such that Ca, Mg, and N contents within the mulch all decreased. In contrast, P and K contents of mulch increased in all treatments. No influence of the N2-fixer on 0-10 cm soil N contents was observed. Two years after establishment, this agroforestry system succeeded in growing a manioc crop and leaving a well-maintained tree fallow after the crop harvest. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - Information on the distribution, level of fragmentation, extent and ecosystem health of tropical forests is key for sustainable landscape management. Therefore, information generated from different types of multispectral and hyperspectral sensors is key to monitoring programs that aimed to link ecosystems dynamics to ecosystem services such as carbon sequestration. This is especially significant for emerging tropical secondary forests which may play key roles on programs aimed to mitigate the effects of climate change. In this context, the aim of this presentation is to evaluate the accuracy of Chris/Proba and non - parametric classification as tools to monitor the ecological succession processes in tropical dry forests in Brazil (Parque Estadual da Mata Seca, Minas Gerais). Our results from the non - parametric approach were separated into an age class map indicating the probably that a given pixel belongs to a forest succession class.

In addition we present data on abundance, breeding biology and food of the species in the Patos Lagoon estuary, the area which the species recently colonized. The maximum abundance recorded in the breeding colony and in a nocturnal roosting site was 53 and 49 individuals respectively. Nesting occurred from September to March. Birds nested in a mixed breeding colony together with about 3,000 breeding pairs of seven other species of Pelecaniformes, in a swampy forest near the margin of the estuary. Five nests were between 1.5 and 4.3 m from the ground, on the shrub Daphnopsis racemosa (Thymelaeaceae), on the trees Sebastiana brasiliensis (Euphorbiaceae) and Mimosa bimucronata (Leguminosae), or on the bamboo Bambusa sp. (Poaceae). Four nests produced two fledglings each, while one nest was abandoned. Of 13 grouped samples of food regurgitated by five nestlings, Pink Shrimp Farfantepenaeus paulensis (Perez-Farfante, 1967) constituted 70% in mass, while total length of ingested fishes and shrimps varied mostly between 20 and 50 mm. Estuarine prey items represented 99% of the total food mass. The recent southward expansion of the breeding range of the Little Blue Heron in South America may be a response to climate warming of the Patos Lagoon estuary. Degradation of estuaries in the southwestern Atlantic may also be forcing the birds to breed in areas outside previous geographical range.

AB  - Surveys were undertaken to examine the floristic changes during secondary succession in three areas of 12 and three of 20-year-old secondary forests in Pernambuco State, Brazil. Two hundred and six species were identified, with 136 being found in the 12-year-old secondary forest and 161 species in the 20-year-old forest. Fabaceae and Myrtaceae were the most important families, increasing in species numbers with regeneration age. Of the 216 species, 115 were trees, 48 shrubs, 16 herbaceous plants, and 24 woody lianas, without significant differences between the two regeneration site ages. NMDS analysis revealed a formation of two floristic groups, distinguishing secondary and mature forests, with a further division within secondary forests in accordance with the time since abandonment. Similarity analysis ANOSIM confirmed the significance of the groups, which had floristic composition significant distinct (R=0.96) and 63% of dissimilarity (SIMPER). However, the sharing of 68 arboreal species between the secondary and mature forests suggests a floristic convergence. DCA analysis of the arboreal component as well as the other plant habits suggested that the separation of the subgroups is correlated with physical and chemical variables of the soils. All of these results indicate that, within the chronosequence analyzed, the velocity and direction of the floristic composition during secondary succession was influenced not only by the time of their abandonment, but also by a wide range of environmental variables.

AB  - In the humid tropics, continuing high deforestation rates are seen alongside an increasing expansion of secondary forests. In order to understand and model the consequences of these dynamic land-use changes for regional water cycles, the response of soil hydraulic properties to forest disturbance and recovery has to be quantified.At a site in the Brazilian Amazônia, we annually monitored soil infiltrability and saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ks) at 12.5, 20cm, and 50cm soil depth after manual forest conversion to pasture (year zero to four after pasture establishment), and during secondary succession after pasture abandonment (year zero to seven after pasture abandonment). We evaluated the hydrological consequences of the detected changes by comparing the soil hydraulic properties with site-specific rainfall intensities and hydrometric observations.Within one year after grazing started, infiltrability and Ks at 12.5 and 20cm depth decreased by up to one order of magnitude to levels which are typical for 20-year-old pasture. In the three subsequent monitoring years, infiltrability and Ks remained stable. Land use did not impact on subsoil permeability. Whereas infiltrability values are large enough to allow all rainwater to infiltrate even after the conversion, the sudden decline of near-surface Ks is of hydrological relevance as perched water tables and overland flow occur more often on pastures than in forests at our study site. After pasture abandonment and during secondary succession, seven years of recovery did not suffice to significantly increase infiltrability and Ks at 12.5 depth although a slight recovery is obvious. At 20cm soil depth, we detected a positive linear increase within the seven-year time frame but annual means did not differ significantly. Although more than a doubling of infiltrability and Ks is still required to achieve pre-disturbance levels, which will presumably take more than a decade, the observed slight increases of Ks might already decrease the probability of perched water table generation and overland flow development well before complete recovery. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - With the objective of providing knowledge about the natural habitat of mosquito larvae, we conducted a study on the culicid fauna and identified larval habitat types at 3 different locations in the Serra do Mar State Park, Brazil, over the 12 months of 1991. We collected 1,425 larvae belonging to 23 species, of which the most frequent were Culex iridescens, Culex spp., Limatus durhami, and Trichoprosopon pallidiventer. The mosquito larval habitats presenting the greatest densities of specimens were bamboo, bromeliads, rubber boots, and streams. We observed that the culicids used a variety of containers as larval habitats and bred under a diversity of ecological conditions. Most of the habitats were natural, formed by bamboo, bromeliads, streams, and depressions in the ground and in rocks, along with artificial habitats consisting of rubber boots and abandoned metal cans. Seven species occurred preferentially in the internodes of closed bamboo stems, 6 in internodes of open stems, and 4 in bromeliads. © 2010 by The American Mosquito Control Association, Inc.

AB  - Replacing the Brazilian Atlantic Forest by pastures has caused a strong impact on this biome. Hence, to evaluate the forest recovery after removing disturbance is a key factor to conserve biodiversity. In this study we analyzed changes in forest structure in five abandoned pastures in southern Brazil, aiming to verify the direction and rate of structural and functional changes in the early succession. The abandoned pastures (by periods of 8, 14, 48, 50 and 96 months) were colonized mainly by trees, animal-dispersed and pioneer species. The data showed that the forest structure was quickly changed with an increase in tree abundance, stem volume and species richness. It indicates that in low fragmented landscapes, such as the northern littoral of Parana State, the resilience of the Atlantic Forest is relatively high and assisted regeneration may be an option to biodiversity conservation strategies. © 2010 ABECO.

AB  - (Limitations of native forest species use may contribute to erosion of traditional and local ecological knowledge among family farmers). Traditional or local ecological knowledge is developed from the continuous relationship between humans and their environment, mainly through the daily use of natural resources. The abandonment of uses, on the other hand, may cause the loss of this kind of knowledge, which frequently occurs due to changes in life style. In this paper, we aimed to evaluate the knowledge and the dynamics of the effective use of native forests in western Santa Catarina state, Brazil. Data collection and analysis were based on the integration of qualitative and quantitative ethnobotanical methods. The results revealed that farmers have comprehensive knowledge of the native forest species of the region and the effective present use of these forest resources is mainly for subsistence, highlighting the dependence of farmers on firewood. However, timber use has declined in recent years due, mainly, to limitations of legal access to native forest species. Farmers older than 40 years cited higher species richness, with a more equitable distribution of species, compared to younger farmers. In addition, attenuation of the correlation between knowledge and present use of species among younger people was noticed. The data suggest the existence of a gradual process of loss of transmission of traditional local knowledge and that there is a risk of erosion of accumulated knowledge.

AB  - This study surveyed the termite fauna in urban properties of the city of Recife, state of Pernambuco, northeastern Brazil. Six-hundred properties were inspected in search for termites or signs of their activity, such as abandoned nests, galleries on walls, and fecal pellets. Seven termite species, belonging to seven genera and three families (Kalotermitidae, Rhinotermitidae, and Termtidae) were found causing some type of damage. Nasutitermes corniger and Cryptotermes dudleyi were the most frequent species within buildings (82.4% and 9.5 %, respectively). Such species, along with Coptotermesgestroi, were responsible for the greatest damage recorded. With the exception of Cryptotermes dudleyi and Coptotermes gestroi, all of the species are native and relatively common in northeastern Brazil's Atlantic forest.

AB  - The main objectives were to study the effect of gap size and canopy openness on the natural regeneration dynamics considering the parameters of sapling growth, recruitment, mortality, density, species composition and above-ground biomass accumulation. The study was carried out in 32 artificial gaps with sizes varying from 100 to 1200m2 and canopy openness from 10 to 45%, from the second to the twelfth year after gap creation. The gap size was measured using the vertical projection of the tree crowns on the ground (Brokaw's definition), and the canopy openness measurement by hemispherical photography. In the first five years, mean sapling growth (0.54cmyear-1), mortality (3.9%year-1) and AGB (26.2Mgha-1 or 8.7Mgha-1year-1) were significantly higher in the gaps than in the forest understorey (0.17cmyear-1, 1.5%year-1 and -0.59Mgha-1year-1 respectively) and positively correlated with gap size and canopy openness. In the same period, recruitment was also significantly higher in the gaps (5.8%year-1) than in the forest understorey (0.4%year-1) but decreased with gap size and negatively correlated with canopy openness. In the first five years, the relative density of pioneer species was higher in the gaps but not significantly correlated with gap size or canopy openness. AGB increased linearly since canopy opening, and twelve years after gap creation it was still higher in larger (121.2Mgha-1 or 10.1Mgha-1year-1) rather than smaller (62.5ha-1 or 5.2ha-1year-1) gaps. Twelve years after gap creation there were no significant differences in the parameters of sapling growth, recruitment, and mortality which could be attributed to the original gap size and canopy openness. © 2011.

AB  - Succession in the Brazilian Amazon depends on prior land-use history. Abandoned clearcuts become dominated by Cecropia trees and exhibit species replacements characteristic of natural succession in forest lightgaps. In contrast, abandoned pastures are dominated by Vismia trees that inhibit natural succession for a decade or more. Here we explore how advance regeneration and limited seed dispersal may contribute to the arrested succession in Vismia-dominated stands. Vegetation surveys showed that every Vismia stem in 3-8 year old Vismia stands originated as a re- sprout. In Cecropia stands, all tree species, including Vismia, originated mostly from seeds, after deforestation and abandonment. The 100% re-sprouts of Vismia in the abandoned pastures confirms that Vismia dominance results from re-sprouting following pasture fires. Seed rain in both Vismia and Cecropia dominated stands was limited almost exclusively to second growth species already reproducing in those stands, suggesting that the bats and birds foraging there were not bringing mature forest seeds into the second growth, but simply feeding and depositing local second growth species. As dispersal was similar in both stand types, dispersal differences cannot account for the ongoing dominance of Vismia relative to the ongoing successional transitions in Cecropia stands. Overall, advance regeneration in the form of Vismia re-sprouts is much more likely to be the driver of Vismia dominated succession than differential dispersal of mature forest seeds. In order to avoid extensive forest conversion into unproductive Vismia wastelands in the Amazon Basin, forestry permits for harvesting timber should include restrictions on subsequent anthropogenic degradation, such as conversion to pasture and prescribed burning. © Lindsay M.

AB  - This study estimates the aboveground biomass accumulation after forest clearing and slash burning and describes the structure and successional development of the secondary forest in the seasonally dry southern Amazon. The original burn study was conducted in four land clearings in 1997, 1998, and 1999. The size of the clearings varied from 1 to 9ha. The native forest was felled, allowed to dry for approximately three months and then burned by the end of the dry season. A census was conducted in the central 1-ha forest on each site prior to the area's felling and burn. The aboveground biomass (AGB) and structure were similar to other primary tropical forests. However, the high density of Cecropia spp. before the forest felling and burn treatment indicates past low intensity disturbances. Seven and eight years after the fire, the fallow forests were still in an early successional stage dominated by Cecropia spp. The four areas had a high biomass accumulation during the studied period, varying from 7.5 to 15.0 Mgha-1year-1. The lower biomass accumulation in one plot was an effect of a higher fire severity, produced by the one-year difference in time between slash and burn of the forest, slowing the natural regeneration of Cecropia spp. The time needed for this forest to recover to the pre-fire AGB levels ranged from 20 to 30 years, assuming the current AGB accumulation rates are maintained. Considering these results, the maintenance of regenerating secondary forests in the Amazon would be a significant contribution to soil and watershed protection, minimizing biodiversity losses and perhaps mitigating climatic changes effects in the region. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Throughout Brazilian Amazonia anthropogenic soils that are the product of pre-Columbian settlements are called Terra Preta de Índio (Indian Dark Earths, TPI). These soils are dramatically different from surrounding soils due to long-term human activity, but there is little information about how secondary forest succession is affected by these differences. We tested if community structure (density, richness and basal area), floristic composition and domesticated species' richness and density were similar between TPI and non-anthropogenic soils (NAS) in 52 25 × 10 m secondary forest plots in different successional stages near three traditional communities along the middle Madeira River, Central Amazonia. We sampled 858 woody individuals on TPI (77 domesticated) and 1095 on NAS (27 domesticated); 550 understory palms on TPI (169 domesticated) and 778 on NAS (123 domesticated). We found 179 species on TPI (10 domesticated), 190 on NAS (8 domesticated), and 74 (25%) in both environments. Although community structure on TPI and NAS was fairly similar, they showed significantly distinctive floristic compositions, both for woody individuals and understory palms. The density and richness of domesticated species was significantly higher on TPI than on NAS for woody individuals, but not for palms. The intimate long-term association of TPI with human activity has lead to the formation of distinct secondary forests and has favored the concentration of domesticated populations of crop species. Hence, secondary forests on anthropogenic soils concentrate agrobiodiversity, offering advantages for in situ conservation of genetic resources, and are unique ecosystems that should be considered in conservation efforts. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - The spatial distribution and growth of human populations have been overlooked by current debates concerning the impact of rural-urban migration for forest conservation in tropical countries. We investigated human settlement and population change in the Brazilian Amazon, combining government census data with field surveys along rivers. Rural populations were clustered and growing within 300 km of urban centers, whereas depopulation and land abandonment dominated farther from towns. The permanently inhabited extent of rivers contracted by 33 ± 8 SE% in recent decades, and households farther upriver were more likely to be considering rural-urban migration. However, harvesting of aquatic and terrestrial wildlife by nonresidents continued into headwater regions, hundreds of kilometers beyond the last household on any given river. Policy makers should consider that expanding cities may drive deforestation and overexploitation near towns while unclear property rights threatens overharvesting and unregulated land speculation in abandoned headwaters. ©2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Question: How can the coexistence of savanna and forest in Amazonian areas with relatively uniform climates be explained? Location: Eastern Marajo Island, northeast Amazonia, Brazil. Methods: The study integrated floristic analysis, terrain morphology, sedimentology and d13C of soil organic matter. Floristic analysis involved rapid ecological assessment of 33 sites, determination of occurrence, specific richness, hierarchical distribution and matrix of floristic similarity between paired vegetation types. Terrain characterization was based on analysis of Landsat images using 4(R), 5(G) and 7(B) composition and digital elevation model (DEM). Sedimentology involved field descriptions of surface and core sediments. Finally, radiocarbon dating and analysis of δ13C of soil profile organic matter and natural ecotone forest-savanna was undertaken. Results: Slight tectonic subsidence in eastern Marajo Island favours seasonal flooding, making it unsuitable for forest growth. However, this area displays slightly convex-up, sinuous morphologies related to paleochannels, covered by forest. Terra-firme lowland forests are expanding from west to east, preferentially occupying paleochannels and replacing savanna. Slack, running water during channel abandonment leads to disappearance of varzea/gallery forest at channel margins. Long-abandoned channels sustain continuous terra-firme forests, because of longer times for more species to establish. Recently abandoned channels have had less time to become sites for widespread tree development, and are either not vegetated or covered by savanna. Conclusion: Landforms in eastern Marajo Island reflect changes in the physical environment due to reactivation of tectonic faults during the latest Quaternary. This promoted a dynamic history of channel abandonment, which controlled a set of interrelated parameters (soil type, topography, hydrology) that determined species location. Inclusion of a geological perspective for paleoenvironmental reconstruction can increase understanding of plant distribution in Amazonia. © 2009 International Association for Vegetation Science.

AB  - The natural regeneration in forest environments is dynamic, variable in space and time and it is in the development cycle of forests. In seasonal tropical forests, due to seasonal climatic changes, natural regeneration depends mainly on availability of soil moisture, which affects patterns of seed production and germination, survival and development of seedling as well. The objective of this study was to analyze the dynamics of natural regeneration in a seasonal semideciduous secondary forest in Pirenópolis, Goiás, Brazil, by analyzing the changes in floristic composition of seedlings and small trees over time and relating them to environmental factors of plots in the study area by using Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA). The results indicated that seedlings were more dynamic than small trees mainly because of climate. This occurred because of the greater susceptibility of the seedling to soil water stress and the increase of solar radiation and temperature in the dry season. It was found a high floristic similarity (± 50%) among population of natural regeneration and the tree community, indicating an advanced stage of natural regeneration of the forest, with Diversity Index higher than 3.0 nats.indv -1. Canonical Correspondence Analysis grouped the species according to the environmental gradient of moisture and shade versus soil cover, placing near to each other, species of humid environments versus species of typical cerrado dry environments.

AB  - There is a great need of research to assess the behavior of micronutrients in natural forests of southern Brazil. Do to this need, the objective of this work was to study the levels and amounts of micronutrients in forest above ground biomass of the forest, in a comparative way, in two secondary succession stages (SSS) in a Seasonal Deciduous Forest in Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. The SSS had enjoyed 35 and 55 years of regeneration since the end of agricultural use, respectively for initial secondary forest (ISF) and late secondary forest (LSF). The above-ground biomass was collected and separated into vegetative strata and these in fractions, thereafter chemically analyzed for the levels of B, Fe, Zn, Mn and Cu. Leaf fractions of arboreal, shrubs and herbaceous strata showed the highest levels for most nutrients. Only the levels of iron and manganese were higher in the bark fraction, for both sucession stages. In the LSF, the herbaceous stratum also showed high levels of Fe. The average levels of micronutrients showed differences between the two sucession stages only in relation to Fe and Mn, with higher levels in LSF biomass. The amount of nutrients stored was always higher in LSF, because of the largest biomass and the higher levels of Fe and Mn in the biomass of this SSS. The quantitative order of nutrient storage in biomass was Fe> Mn> Zn> B> Cu.

AB  - This study evaluated the floristic and phytosociological structure of the native tree community of the Atlantic Forest in five plantations of eucalypt (Corymbia citriodora) abandoned since 1996 in the União Biological Reserve, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Eleven years after abandonment, plots of 20×10m were established totaling 0.1ha, in five different stands. A total of 219 individuals with DBH ≥5cm were sampled and distributed in 18 families and 36 species. The most important species were Xylopia sericea, Eugenia supraaxillaris, Cupania oblongifolia and Annona dolabripetala. Fabaceae was the richest family in species, followed by Myrtaceae and Bignoniaceae. Annonaceae was the family that had the greatest number of individuals, followed by Myrtaceae and Sapindaceae. The density and basal area per ha, by stands, ranged from 0 to 1010 individuals and 0 to 9.9m2 ha-1, respectively. Species richness ranged from 0 (stand 4) to 22 (stand 2). The results indicate a low natural regeneration in the understory of the eucalypt stands 11 years after abandonment. The possible inhibitory role of Corymbia citriodora in the establishment and growth of native tree species is discussed.

AB  - The importance of the arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungus for establishment, survival and growth of the tropical native woody species belonging to different ecological groups of succession from Brazilian tropical forests is discussed. The response to AM inoculation and the degree of AM root colonization of the plant species decreased with the advance among successional ecological groups. High response to inoculation and high colonization among early successional woody species (pioneer and early secondary) emphasize the importance of AM association for the initial growth of these woody species, which are evolved in the initial tropical forest structuring. The late successional woody species (late secondary and climax), which dominates in the mature forests, showed absence or low both responsiveness to inoculation and degree of root colonization, indicating limitations to use of the AM fungus as strategies for mineral acquisition in early growth stages. In this chapter, some experimental results of AM inoculation in tropical native woody species from different ecological groups will be presented and discussed, especially in relation to the woody species development, the vegetal succession and the importance of AM association on the reclamation of degraded areas. © 2012 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

AB  - Secondary vegetation (SV) is an important element of the landscape after forest is cleared in Brazilian Amazon. Deforestation maps derived from thematic mapper (TM) imagery were used to sample random areas of old and recent settlement, and small and large farms. TM data were then used to classify SV in the selected areas. Results showed that SV represented higher fractions of the landscape in areas of more recent and small-farm settlement than in areas of old and large-farm settlement. These findings emphasize the importance of considering the long-term evolution of land use systems if the relationship between secondary succession, land rotation and abandonment is to be better understood. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - To evaluate the reliability of data obtained by Winkler extraction in Atlantic forest sites in southern Brazil, we studied litter beetle assemblages in secondary forests (5 to 55 years after abandonment) and old-growth forests at two seasonally different points in time. For all regeneration stages, species density and abundance were lower in April compared to August; but, assemblage composition of the corresponding forest stages was similar in both months. We suggest that sampling of small litter inhabiting beetles at different points in time using the Winkler technique reveals identical ecological patterns, which are more likely to be influenced by sample incompleteness than by differences in their assemblage composition. A strong relationship between litter quantity and beetle occurrences indicates the importance of this variable for the temporal species density pattern. Additionally, the sampled beetle material was compared with beetle data obtained with pitfall traps in one old-growth forest. Over 60% of the focal species captured with pitfall traps were also sampled by Winkler extraction in different forest stages. Few beetles with a body size too large to be sampled by Winkler extraction were only sampled with pitfall traps. This indicates that the local litter beetle fauna is dominated by small species. Hence, being aware of the exclusion of large beetles and beetle species occurring during the wet season, the Winkler method reveals a reliable picture of the local leaf litter beetle community.

AB  - The study was realized in an area of riparian forest in process by means of rehabilitation. The study area is located in Rio Itapemirim, in Alegre city, Brazil. The occupation and use of the soil before the recovery were of pasture with Brachiaria sp. The recovery of this area was in 1997, with autochthonous and allochthonous species, in casually distribution arrangement, in an area of 1,2 ha. For this studies was realized forest inventories in the periods of 2004/2005 and 2005/2006, being measured the arboreal individuals with circumference at breast height (CBH) and total heights. The species found in the area were identified and classified in this ecological groups, dispersion syndromes and wild presence, it forms calculated the floristic parameters, the vertical structure and the structural dynamics of this plantation. The objective of this work went evaluate the development of the plantation implanted to subsidize practical silviculture with relationship to the selection and plantation of species for the revegetation of degraded areas of riparian forest, in similar conditions. The results of the studies demonstrated that a forest plantation was implanted with great diversity of species and the bedding in height classes it went to the likeness of natural heterogeneous. The species identified as builders of the plantation of the studied area were: Anadenanthera colubrina, Caesalpinia leyostachia, Acacia auriculiformis, cacia mangium, Handroanthus serratifolius, Inga edulis, Joannesia princeps, Pterogyne nitens, Enterelobium contortisiliquum, Tabernaemontana hystrix, and Anthocephalus indicus. The implanted community's distribution diametric happens in reverse J shape having the pioneer individuals' predominance in all the classes of CBH. The dynamics of the horizontal structure points that for the success, continuity and development of the recovery of the area, the natural regeneration be monitored in relation to its presence and efficiency of the biotic factors and abiotic those interfere in the same. The not tree individualsobservance in natural regeneration, in the class of inclusion of the study, indicate the initial fragility of the area heading for sustentabilidade of the system.

AB  - Seed dispersal by small primates may be particularly relevant in areas where populations of larger frugivores have been reduced or extinguished by hunting andor habitat disturbance. In this context, the aim of this study was to evaluate the role of the golden-headed lion tamarin Leontopithecus chrysomelas as a seed disperser in Atlantic forest remnants in Brazil. To this end, we opportunistically collected feces deposited during observations on the feeding behavior of two groups of golden-headed lion tamarins ranging in the degraded areas of the Una Biological Reserve, Bahia, Brazil, from February 2006 to January 2007. We collected 587 fecal samples, of which 524 contained seeds from 24 plant species, distributed over 13 families. Disregarding seeds of<3 mm, the majority of seeds recovered were bromeliad seeds. In general, ingestion of seeds by golden-headed lion tamarins did not improve the germination proportion or decrease the germination delay of seeds, with the exception of Aechmea spp. seeds. The tamarins encountered different habitats during their daily activity period, while feeding and defecating. Consequently, some seeds were transported to different habitats including disturbed areas. Thus, the role of seed dispersal in combination with the daily movement pattern of L. chrysomelas contributes to the persistence of fruit plants and epiphyte species and to the natural regeneration process within Atlantic forest remnants. in Portuguese is available at. © 2009 The Association for Tropical Biology and Conservation.

AB  - Fragments of Atlantic Rainforest and extensive eucalyptus plantations are part of the landscape in the southeast region of Brazil. Many studies have been conducted on litter ant diversity in these forests, but there are few reports on the nesting sites. In the present study, we characterized the ant communities that nest in twigs in the leaf litter of dense ombrophilous forests and eucalyptus trees. The colony demographics associated with the physical structure of the nest were recorded. In the eucalyptus forests, the study examined both managed and unmanaged plantations. During five months, all undecomposed twigs between 10 and 30 cm in length containing ants found within a 16-m2 area on the surface of the leaf litter were collected. A total of 307 nests and 44 species were recorded. Pheidole, Solenopsis, and Camponotus were the most represented genera. Pheidole sp.13, Pheidole sp.43 and Linepithema neotropicum were the most populous species. The dense ombrophilous forest and a eucalyptus plantation unmanaged contained the highest number of colonized twigs; these communities were the most similar and the most species rich. Our results indicate that the twigs are important resources as they help to maintain the litter diversity of dense rain forest and abandoned eucalypt crops. © 2012 Debora R. de Souza et al.

AB  - The results of a survey of non-timber forest products (NTFP) associated with tree species (CBH ≥ 15 cm) of riparian forest remnants in the upper Paraná river (Mata do Araldo) are presented. The species examined were ranked according to their potential value for sustainable exploitation (PVSE) of NTFP, applying the following information obtained from literature review: density, parts used, capacity for natural regeneration and growth, knowledge about reproductive biology and population dynamic, required processing and level of injury or toxicity. For a total of 58 species, 29 reached PVSE higher than 10, being considered of high potential for sustainable exploitation of NTFP. Among these, the most important were Inga vera and Lonchocarpus cultratus, with VPES = 14 as beekeeping, and with PVSE = 13, for ecological use, ornamental and food. In addition, Parapiptadenia rigida, also has PVSE = 13 as beekeeping and medicinal. The results show a promising basis for achieving goals of conservation and regional development, from sustainable alternative use of forest resources. In particular, the use of species as sources of medicinal, ecological, ornamental, beekeeping and biochemical resources was recorded as the primary vocation for the study area.

AB  - In this study, we examined the impacts of Attalea oleifera on the structure of seedling bank and discuss potential mechanisms of palm influence. Seed rain, seedling bank, and palm leaf fall were assessed beneath the canopy and in the vicinity of 16 adult palms across the edges of a large fragment (3500 ha) of the Atlantic forest. Moreover, we examined A. oleifera impacts on seed germination and seedling mortality by experimentally submitting seeds and seedlings to prolonged palm-leaf covering. As expected, seedling bank beneath the adults exhibited reduced abundance and species richness at local and habitat scale. Small to large seeds (3.1-30 mm) were underrepresented in the seed rain below adults palms, while experimental leaf covering drastically reduced both seed germination and seedling survivorship. A. oleifera leaf fall occurred over the whole year (3.6±2.7 leaves/individual/yr), which resulted in deep leaf litter mounds (10.7±9.2 cm). Finally, adult palm density (21.6±11.9 individuals/ha) correlated negatively with seedling density across Attalea clusters. Our results suggest that A. oleifera exerts negative effects on the seedling bank by reducing seedling abundance and richness as a consequence of two complementary mechanisms: impoverished and size-biased seed rain plus reduced seed germination and increased seedling mortality due to prolonged covering by fallen leaves. © 2009 The Author(s).

AB  - This study focuses on a forested area from southwestern Marajó Island, mouth of Amazon River, aiming to analyse the relationship between plant composition and the latest Quaternary evolution of a land-form with palaeochannel morphologies. A floristic survey aiming to characterize the inner and outer palaeochannel areas indicated similar phytossociological parameters. However, a large volume of species was exclusive to only one of these areas. Although the present-day forest is fairly uniform, a significant variation in floristic composition was recorded according to differences in lithology, topography and hydrology. These were determined by the evolution of the physical environment associated with successive stages of abandonment of a large fluvial drainage system during the latest Pleistocene to Holocene. The results derived from this study indicate that reconstruction of a physical environment is an important parameter to be taken into account before establishing models aiming to explain the distribution of modern plant species in tropical areas. © 2011 The Authors.

AB  - Natural regeneration and structure and their relationship to environmental variables were studied in three sections of a gallery forest, in Eastern Mato Grosso, Brazil (14°43'S and 52°21'W). The assumption was that natural regeneration is constrained by environmental determinants at all stages of development of the tree community. The objective was to analyse the forest structure and to verify the relationship between species distribution and abundance at different stages of regeneration and environmental variables. In each section, 47 contiguous (10x10m) permanent plots were established to sample trees (gbh≥15cm), following a systematic design. Seedlings (0.01 to 1m height), saplings (1.01 to 2m) and poles (from 2.01m height to gbh<15cm) were sampled in sub-plots of 1x1m, 2x2m and 5x5m, respectively. In each plot, soil properties, gaps projection, bamboos, rocky cover, declivity and depth of ground watertable were determined. The relationships between the environmental variables with trees and seedling communities were assessed by canonical correspondence analysis. In spite of the sections being near to each other, they presented large differences in floristics, structure and site conditions. The forest soil presented a low cation exchange capacity and a high level of Al saturation. The occurrence of bamboos and gaps and the depth of ground watertable limited the occurrence of poles and trees. The high degree of structural heterogeneity for each regeneration category was related primarily to a humidity gradient; but soil fertility (Ca+Mg) was also a determinant of seedling and sapling communities.

AB  - The present study aimed to quantify the stocks of volume, total biomass with bark and carbon in a fragment of Semideciduous Seasonal Forest in mid-secondary succession stage (capoeira) located in the Minas Gerais forest zone, in Viçosa, the State of Minas Gerais, Brazil. For the volume conversion in biomass, estimates of basic density of 10 species with higher IV (Importance Value) were obtained. The stock of carbon was determined considering that the dry biomass contains, approximately, 50% carbon. 31 tree species were registered, distributed in 29 genera and 21 families. The trees' average total biomass was 38.99 t.ha-1, which corresponded to a carbon stock of 19.50 ± 8.08 tC.ha-1. The value found is considered low when compared to other studies. Influences of prior use and edge effects may explain the low biomass and carbon stock found. The estimates obtained for the capoeira can be used as subsidies for the elaboration of afforestation/reforestation projects in the Clean Development Mechanism.

AB  - For animal species inhabiting heterogeneous landscapes, the tortuosity of the dispersal path is a key determinant of the success in locating habitat patches. Path tortuosity within and beyond perceptual range must differ, and may be differently affected by intrinsic attributes of individuals and extrinsic environmental factors. Understanding how these factors interact to determine path tortuosity allows more accurate inference of successful movements between habitat patches. We experimentally determined the effects of intrinsic (body mass and species identity) and extrinsic factors (distance to nearest forest fragment and matrix type) on the tortuosity of movements of three forest-dwelling didelphid marsupials, in a fragmented landscape of the Atlantic Forest, Brazil. A total of 202 individuals were captured in forest fragments and released in three unsuitable matrix types (mowed pasture, abandoned pasture and manioc plantation), carrying spool-and-line devices. Twenty-four models were formulated representing a priori hypotheses of major determinants of path tortuosity, grouped in three scenarios (only intrinsic factors, only extrinsic factors and models with combinations of both), and compared using a model selection approach. Models were tested separately for individuals released within the perceptual range of the species, and for individuals released beyond the perceptual range. Matrix type strongly affected path tortuosity, with more obstructed matrix types hampering displacement of animals. Body mass was more important than species identity to determine path tortuosity, with larger animals moving more linearly. Increased distance to the fragment resulted in more tortuous paths, but actually reflects a threshold in perceptual range: linear paths within perceptual range, tortuous paths beyond. The variables tested explained successfully path tortuosity, but only for animals released within the perceptual range. Other factors, such as wind intensity and direction of plantation rows, may be more important for individuals beyond their perceptual range. Simplistic scenarios considering only intrinsic or extrinsic factors are inadequate to predict path tortuosity, and to infer dispersal success in heterogeneous landscapes. Perceptual range represents a fundamental threshold where the effects of matrix type, body mass and individual behaviour change drastically. © 2010 The Authors.

AB  - The objective of this work was to compare a natural regeneration of two areas with Caatinga vegetation with different histories of use in the Agreste of Pernambuco. These studies were carried out in two areas: Area l, native forest, with no historical evidences of deforestation for agriculture purposes; and Area ll, which was previously occupied with the cultivation of forage cactus and was abandoned about 30 years ago at the stage of secondary succession. For data collection, it was used a total of 24 plots of 5 x 5 m dimensions, 12 plots in each area, and considering the plants with circumference at breast height (CBH) of 1.30 m from ground (CAP) < 6.0 cm and height ≥1.0 m as individuals in natural regeneration. It was identified in the structure survey of regenerating individuals structural survey in both areas, 581 plants of 14 botanical families, 26 genus and 30 species. The total densities obtained in this study were 11,200 and 8,116 individuals.ha-1 in Area l and ll, respectively. The species with the greatest densities of natural regeneration in Area l were the following: Croton argyrophyllus, Senegalia bahiensis, Croton blanchetianus and Coutarea hexandra and in the Area ll: Senegalia bahiensis, Poincianella pyramidalis, Zanthoxyllum sp, Croton blanchetianus and Croton argyrophyllus.

AB  - Morphologies related to paleochannels are widespread through large areas of the Brazilian Amazonia. Despite the relevance for reconstructing the evolution of the largest fluvial system on Earth, detailed mapping of most of these features is still unavailable. The lack of works emphasizing Amazonian paleochannels represents an enormous bias toward the understanding of both migrating dynamics of Amazonian rivers through time and processes (e.g. tectonics, climate, sea-level fluctuation) that might have promoted channel abandonment. A few previous studies have demonstrated the successful application of digital elevation model (DEM) collected during the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) for mapping morphologies related to paleochannels still preserved under forested lowland Amazonian areas. The present study applies different remote sensing techniques, including JERS-1 90m, SAR/SIPAM-6m, Landsat, and ASTER, to successfully unravel a myriad of paleochannels in Marajo Island (Amazon mouth), which were previously undetected using solely SRTM data. The results presented in this work are promising for mapping paleodrainage in other forested areas of the Amazonas basin. Considering the several problems involved on data acquisition aiming to approach the evolution of Amazonian rivers in space and time (e.g. large dimension, lack of natural geological exposures, difficult access, dense forest cover, and high cloud volume), a proper mapping of Amazonas paleodrainage using different remote sensing techniques is crucial to visualize potential paleochannel morphologies and patterns that are of high relevance for reconstructing the Amazonian fluvial dynamics through time. © 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - The floristic composition of vascular species present in an urban forest remnant in the Ibiporã Forest Park (23°15'71"S and 51°01'83"W, Park entrance), Southern Brazil, was studied from May 2006 to May 2008. The species were divided in life form and tree species were placed in successional categories. A total of 176 native species, 147 genera and 57 families were found. The majority of species were Angiosperms (98%) while 2% were Pteridophyta. The richest families were Fabaceae (19), Bignoniaceae, Malvaceae (nine), Meliaceae and Rubiaceae (eight). The tree species were majority (53%), following by herbaceous (16%), vines (14%), shrubs (13%) and epiphyte species (4%). The successional characterization of the tree species showed a slight predominance of the late secondary species (52%) over species of early succession (45%), indicating that the vegetation of the PFI is in the intermediate to advanced stage of ecological succession.

AB  - In some tropical regions, following the abandonment of agriculture and pastures, secondary forests can recover plant species richness and forest structure (e.g. canopy cover, biomass); however, the importance of these secondary forests for fauna is not clear. Secondary forests can benefit fauna by providing suitable habitats, connecting forests fragments, and increasing gene flow. Previous studies of forest regeneration have showed different levels of amphibian recovery. In Puerto Rico, 1-5. years old secondary forests achieved similar amphibian species richness and composition in comparison with old-growth forests, while in Brazil secondary forests from 14 to 19. years of recovery only recovered 60% of the species of old-growth forests. We evaluated amphibian recovery in secondary forests in northeastern Costa Rica, by assessing amphibian recovery in 12 secondary forests that vary in age of recovery and in three old-growth forests using visual and acoustic surveys. Our sites varied in terms of their landscape (e.g. amount of surrounding forest) and forest characteristics (e.g. forest age, aboveground biomass, basal area, number of tree species, number of stems, leaf-litter depth), but there was no relationship between these characteristics and amphibian species richness or species composition. We found that amphibians are recovering rapidly in secondary forests in Costa Rica, and even young forests (10-16. years) had similar species richness and composition in comparison with old-growth forests. These forests are providing suitable microhabitats conditions for amphibians. In addition, this study highlights the importance of landscape characteristics. The abundance of amphibian species sources (e.g. forest patches) and connections between forests appear to be helping the species colonize these sites. Worldwide, the area of secondary forests is increasing, and our results show that these habitats are suitable for a diversity of amphibian species, suggesting that these forests can help reduce amphibian population and species decline. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - São Paulo, Brazil, is the world's third most populous city with over 18 million residents, and population growth in southern São Paulo exceeds 8% per year. The Capivarí-Monos Environmental Protection Area (APACapivarí-Monos in Portuguese), a participatory governance system in which municipal officials and local representatives share authority for land use regulation, occupies the southernmost 25,000 ha of the city. The APACapivarí-Monos is intended, as defined by the enabling legislation, to "protect biodiversity [and] protect water resources and remaining tracts of Atlantic Forest." This area is an important source of environmental services: its watershed provides approximately 24% of the city's potable water, as well as wildlife habitat, carbon sequestration, and soil protection. Geographically, this area provides a buffer zone between São Paulo and the Serra do Mar State Park, the largest legally protected tract of Atlantic Forest, a global biodiversity hotspot. Land uses in the APACapivarí-Monos include small farms, native secondary forest, native primary cloud forest, natural grasslands, and active and abandoned commercial plantations of pines and eucaplypts. Because this area is recognized to be of unusual environmental importance, a complex mosaic of frequently contradictory land use regulations has developed, contributing to the lack of enforcement of, and voluntary compliance with, environmental law. One problem with the current legal system in this area is the frequent use of the term "sustainability" as defined in Brazilian legislation. In the APACapivarí-Monos, the most restrictive land use regulations are defined in terms of sustainability and are applied to zones that contain a large proportion of São Paulo's natural land cover and commercial plantation forestry. The question of what constitutes sustainable forestry management, however, is problematic, depending on management decisions and on the definition of sustainability used. This means that the term "sustainability" does not provide an adequate yes-or-no legal guideline, as would be necessary for current legislation to function. In this area, improving the coherence and enforceability of the legal structure, rather than its restrictiveness and enforcement per se, is key to improving environmental governance. Additional regulation of forestry activities would be needed in the APACapivarí-Monos because of its importance as a source of environmental services. Rather than create necessarily complex independent forestry regulations, the City of São Paulo should consider incorporating a forest certification system (such as that of the Forest Stewardship Council) into local legislation for zones in which the stated purposes of existing legislation aligns with certification requirements. © 2011 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

AB  - This study was conducted in a riparian area of Cerrado (savanna) in order to verify if a native plant community is positively or negatively infuenced by reforestation with a fast growing exotic species (Pinus el-liottii Engelm), on the basis of the ecological processes involved. Four treatments were compared: Pinus trees planted at 3 × 3 m, 3 × 2 m and 2 × 2 m, and a control (not planted). Every treatment consisted of four replications in randomized blocks and in 16 plots set along the stream. Variables related to growth for both planted and native species were evaluated, as well as the number of native species regenerating, dispersal syndrome, and also the ground cover by grasses. After eleven years from the beginning of the experiment, the higher the density of Pinus, the higher the density, number of species and diversity of native plants regenerating. Therefore the exotic trees facilitated the regeneration processes of native species. Analysis of explanatory variables showed that such facilitation was due to an indirect effect of the shading by Pinus trees, which reduced ground grass cover and prevented the inhibitory effect over plant community regeneration and growth. Further evaluations to detect competition between Pinus trees and the native community would be necessary to check if the facilitation effects persist in the long term.

AB  - The study was conducted at the Mata dos Godoy State Park in Londrina, state of Paraná, Brazil. Baited pitfall traps were installed in the forest, in adjacent abandoned pasture land, and on the borders between these two environments. Every two weeks, from June 1999 to May 2000, the traps were placed for 24 hours and the material was collected every 12 hours. The 4687 specimens of Scarabaeinae collected belong to 13 genera and 27 species. The most frequent species were Onthophagus catharinensis (Paulian, 1936) (22.1%), Onthophagus hirculus (Mannerhein, 1829) (20.1%), Dichotomius mormon (Ljungh, 1799) (13.1%), Sulcophanaeus menelas (Laporte, 1840) (12.8%), and Eurystemus parallelus (Dalman, 1824) (10.6%). The other species collected amounted to less than 4.7%. The difference in numbers of specimens collected in the three environments was not significant (K(2.72) = 0.63, p = 0.729). The distribution patterns of species composition for the different environments (ANOSIM R = 0.29, p < 0.01) and activity periods (ANOSIM R = 0.18, p < 0.01) were different. Sulcophanaeus menelas, Canthidium aff. trinodosum, O. hirculus, and E. parallelus were the most abundant species, being predominantly diurnal; the first three species were more active on abandoned pasture. Most of the Dichothomius assifer (Eschscholtz, 1822) and D. mormon specimens were captured at night. The latter species was the most abundant in edges, whereas D. assifer, Scybalochantum aff. zischkai, and O. catharinensis can be considered bioindicators because they were either exclusively or highly predominant in the best preserved areas. A larger number of individuals was observed from December 1999 through March 2000, which is the time of the year when adults of Scarabaeinae normally emerge and fly, in the studied region. The highest diversity (88.89%) was observed in February. © 2011 Sociedade Brasileira de Zoologia.

AB  - Secondary forests and exotic tree plantations are expanding across tropical landscapes. However, our current understanding of the value of these human-dominated forest landscapes for invertebrate biodiversity conservation is still very poor. In this paper, we use the leaf-litter ant fauna to assess invertebrate diversity in one commercially managed Eucalyptus plantation (four years old), two abandoned plantations of different regeneration ages (16 and 31 years), and one neighboring secondary Atlantic Forest in Southeastern Brazil. There was a clear gradient in species richness from the secondary forest to the managed Eucalyptus plantation; richness and diversity peaked in secondary forest and in the older regenerating Eucalyptus plantation. Significantly more species were recorded in secondary forest samples than in Eucalyptus plantations, but Eucalyptus plantations had a similar level of richness. Furthermore, a non-metric multidimensional scaling analysis revealed clear differences in species composition between the younger managed Eucalyptus plantation (understory absent) and habitats with sub-developed or developed understory. Eucalyptus plantations were characterized by an assemblage of widespread, generalist species very different from those known to occur in core forest habitats of southeastern Brazil. Our results indicate that while older regenerating Eucalyptus plantations can provide habitat to facilitate the persistence of generalist ant species, it is unlikely to conserve most of the primary forest species, such as specialized predators, Dacetini predators, and nomadic species.

AB  - The paper analyzed the floristic, wood volume and their biomass in two areas of the Atlantic Forest, located at the Reserva Biológica Sítio Palmares in Santa Maria de Jetibá county in state of Espirito Santo. It was measure each six plots in one preserved areas (primary forest) and in one 33 years old on natural regeneration process (secondary forest). It was measured all the trees with over 5 cm DBH. At the area primary forest were found 341 trees distributed in 70 species and 32 families. The tree population presented an average of 14.82 cm DBH and a basal area of 43.60 m2 ha-1, corresponding to wood trunk and branches of 518 m3 ha-1 equivalent to 397,674 kg ha-1. The secondary forest on natural regeneration had 195 trees distributed in 17 species and 14 families, with a DBH of 12.4 cm. The basal area was 12.5 m2 ha-1, corresponding to 93 m3 ha-1 of wood volume and 54,631 kg ha-1 of biomass.

AB  - Only 7% of the once extensive forest along the eastern coast of Brazil remains, and much of that is degraded and threatened by agricultural expansion and urbanization. We wondered if methods similar to those developed to establish fast-growing Eucalyptus plantations might also work to enhance survival and growth of rainforest species on degraded pastures composed of highly competitive C4 grasses. An 8-factor experiment was laid out to contrast the value of different intensities of cultivation, application of fertilizer and weed control on the growth and survival of a mixture of 20 rainforest species planted at two densities: 3 m × 1 m, and 3 m × 2 m. Intensive management increased seedling survival from 90% to 98%, stemwood production and leaf area index (LAI) by ∼4-fold, and stemwood production per unit of light absorbed by 30%. Annual growth in stem biomass was closely related to LAI alone (r2 = 0.93, p < 0.0001), and the regression improved further in combination with canopy nitrogen content (r2 = 0.99, p < 0.0001). Intensive management resulted in a nearly closed forest canopy in less than 4 years, and offers a practical means to establish functional forests on abandoned agricultural land. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Land use leads to massive habitat destruction and fragmentation in tropical forests. Despite its global dimensions the effects of fragmentation on ecosystem dynamics are not well understood due to the complexity of the problem. We present a simulation analysis performed by the individual-based model FORMIND. The model was applied to the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, one of the world's biodiversity hot spots, at the Plateau of São Paulo. This study investigates the long-term effects of fragmentation processes on structure and dynamics of different sized remnant tropical forest fragments (1-100. ha) at community and plant functional type (PFT) level. We disentangle the interplay of single effects of different key fragmentation processes (edge mortality, increased mortality of large trees, local seed loss and external seed rain) using simulation experiments in a full factorial design. Our analysis reveals that particularly small forest fragments below 25. ha suffer substantial structural changes, biomass and biodiversity loss in the long term. At community level biomass is reduced up to 60%. Two thirds of the mid- and late-successional species groups, especially shade-tolerant (late successional climax) species groups are prone of extinction in small fragments. The shade-tolerant species groups were most strongly affected; its tree number was reduced more than 60% mainly by increased edge mortality. This process proved to be the most powerful of those investigated, explaining alone more than 80% of the changes observed for this group. External seed rain was able to compensate approximately 30% of the observed fragmentation effects for shade-tolerant species. Our results suggest that tropical forest fragments will suffer strong structural changes in the long term, leading to tree species impoverishment. They may reach a new equilibrium with a substantially reduced subset of the initial species pool, and are driven towards an earlier successional state. The natural regeneration potential of a landscape scattered with forest fragments appears to be limited, as external seed rain is not able to fully compensate for the observed fragmentation-induced changes. Our findings suggest basic recommendations for the management of fragmented tropical forest landscapes. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Some Eucalyptus species are widely used as a plantation crop in tropical and subtropical regions. One reason for this is the diversity of end uses, but the main reason is the high level of wood production obtained from commercial plantings. With the advancement of biotechnology it will be possible to expand the geographical area in which eucalypts can be used as commercial plantation crops, especially in regions with current climatic restrictions. Despite the popularity of eucalypts and their increasing range, questions still exist, in both traditional planting areas and in the new regions: Can eucalypts invade areas of native vegetation, causing damage to natural ecosystems biodiversity?The objective of this study it was to assess whether eucalypts can invade native vegetation fragments in proximity to commercial stands, and what factors promote this invasive growth. Thus, three experiments were established in forest fragments located in three different regions of Brazil. Each experiment was composed of 40 plots (1m2 each one), 20 plots located at the border between the forest fragment and eucalypts plantation, and 20 plots in the interior of the forest fragments. In each experimental site, the plots were paired by two soil exposure conditions, 10 plots in natural conditions and 10 plots with soil exposure (no plant and no litter). During the rainy season, 2g of eucalypts seeds were sown in each plot, including Eucalyptus grandis or a hybrid of E. urophylla×E. grandis, the most common commercial eucalypt species planted in the three region. At 15, 30, 45, 90, 180, 270 and 360 days after sowing, we assessed the number of seedlings of eucalypts and the number of seedlings of native species resulting from natural regeneration. Fifteen days after sowing, the greatest number of eucalypts seedlings (37m-2) was observed in the plots with lower luminosity and exposed soil. Also, for native species, it was observed that exposed soil improved natural germination reaching the highest number of 163 seedlings per square meter. Site and soil exposure were the factors that have the greatest influence on seed germination of both eucalypt and native species. However, 270 days after sowing, eucalypt seedlings were not observed at any of the three experimental sites. The result shows the inability of eucalypts to adapt to condition outside of their natural range. However, native species demonstrated their strong capacity for natural regeneration in forest fragments under the same conditions where eucalypts were seeded. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Litterfall and litter decomposition are vital processes in tropical forests because they regulate nutrient cycling. Nutrient cycling can be altered by forest fragmentation. The Atlantic Forest is one of the most threatened biomes in the world due to human occupation over the last 500 years. This scenario has resulted in fragments of different size, age and regeneration phase. To investigate differences in litterfall and leaf decomposition between forest successional phases, we compared six forest fragments at three different successional phases and an area of mature forest on the Atlantic Plateau of Sao Paulo, Brazil. We sampled litter monthly from November 2008 to October 2009. We used litterbags to calculate leaf decomposition rate of an exotic species, Tipuana tipu (Fabaceae), over the same period litter sampling was performed. Litterfall was higher in the earliest successional area. This pattern may be related to the structural properties of the forest fragments, especially the higher abundance of pioneer species, which have higher productivity and are typical of early successional areas. However, we have not found significant differences in the decomposition rates between the studied areas, which may be caused by rapid stabilization of the decomposition environment (combined effect of microclimatic conditions and the decomposers activities). This result indicates that the leaf decomposition process have already been restored to levels observed in mature forests after a few decades of regeneration, although litterfall has not been entirely restored. This study emphasizes the importance of secondary forests for restoration of ecosystem processes on a regional scale.

AB  - Over the past forty years, Itacolomi State Park (ISP), located in the region of Ouro Preto/Minas Gerais, has been subject to several changes in its patterns of land use and occupation. These changes were recorded and quantified using remote sensing and GIS techniques, which allowed for the construction of four land use maps, representing the changes in the area during the last four decades. In order to evaluate these changes, the following classes of vegetation were defined: Seasonal Semideciduous Forest, Rocky outcrops and Anthropogenic Areas. First, land use maps from 1966 and 1974 were compared, defining the first period of analysis; then, 1974 and 1986 maps were considered in the second period of analysis, and finally the third period of analysis used 1986 and 2000 maps. The changes that occurred in ISP were predominantly of anthropogenic origin, with greater intensity in the seventies. As a result of the abandonment of these activities and also due to greater monitoring and control of human actions performed at ISP during the following decades, the abandoned areas are gradually being occupied by native plants such as "candeia" (Eremanthus sp), rehabilitating the region.

AB  - The knowledge of structure and composition of forest strata contributes to understanding the conservation status and dynamics of plant communities. The study of forest understory is important to the knowledge of the succession process. The Seasonal Subtropical Forest remnant named Mato do Silva (27° 55'26" S and 53° 53'15" W) was studied aiming to describe the structure of understory in the late successional forest (LF) and in the young secondary forest (SF), an 11 years old post-agricultural site with canopy dominance of Ateleia glazioveana Baill. The phytosociological survey was carried out through the point quarter method and included individuals of tree and shrub species from 0.5 to 3.0 m of height. The sampling consisted of 384 individuals in LF (67 species) and 284 individuals in SF (20 species). A total of 79 species were observed, and only eight species occurred in both areas. The specific diversity (H') was 3.45 and 2.42 nats in the understory of LF and SF, respectively. The Pielou's evenness index (J) was 0.85 to LF and 0.80 to SF, respectively. Cupania vernalis Camb. and Psychotria leiocarpa Müll. Arg. were the prominent species in the LF while A. glazioveana and Solanum mauritianum Scop. were outstanding in the SF understory. Shade-tolerant and late secondary tree species occurred in large proportion in the LF forest, while pioneers and early secondary tree species predominated in the SF. In addition, certain dominant species in the understory of the SF were absent in the LF understory, such as A. glazioveana, Solanum compressum L. B. Sm. & Downs, Helietta apiculata Bentham and Gledtisia amorphoides (Griseb.) Taubert, which indicates that such species are associated to early stages of forest succession. G. amorphoides is considered an endangered species, and the early successional stages could be necessary for conservation of this species. A decrease in the pH and mineral nutrient levels in the soil was linked to the successional process, indicating the transference of nutrients to the aboveground biomass.

AB  - This research aimed to identify the presence of floristic clusters in the mechanisms of natural regeneration and the influence of environmental factors on the distribution of species and plots in the seedling bank. The study was conducted in the National Forest of São Francisco de Paula, RS, using six conglomerates (1ha), with 16 plots (20 × 20m) each, disregarding the surrounding 10m. Seed rain (SR) was sampled in 96 circular collectors (1m 2), distributed in the center of each plot. The soil seed bank (SB) was collected, using iron templates (0.25 × 0.25 m) and 3m of each collector from CS. The seedling bank (SeB) was sampled in plots of 2 × 2m, located 4m from SR collectors, counting the number of individuals per specie, with height ≥ 30cm and diameter at breast height (DBH) < 1cm. Cluster analysis was performed by TWINSPAN (Two-way Indicator Species Analysis), associated with canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) for BP. The presence of the CS and BS clusters was verified by using the nonparametric test of the sum of the orders (Wilcoxon). Three groups were identified and CCA indicated the slope as the environmental variable with the greatest influence on the distribution of species and plots. The groups showed great relationship with its history of use; with the highest densities and lowest richness for the three mechanisms in the group related with the highest level of human interference. The presence of clusters indicates that the regenerative processes of the forest do not occur equally in the remaining forest; is necessary to know them to enable the planning of conservation and management strategies, appropriate to each species and the environment.

AB  - This study was carried out in a fragment of a Seasonal Semideciduous Forest, which belongs to the Universidade Federal de Viçosa, Minas Gerais, Brazil (20°35′-28°50′S e 42°45′-43°00′W), where ten 5 × 5m plots, 1m away from each other, were set up. A controlled burning was performed on the plots, following the wind-driven fire technique, according to the slope orientation. The natural regeneration layer was floristically and structurally characterized before and after the fire. The floristic survey was performed on the upper right corner of each plot aided by a 1 × 1m wooden square strung with rubber bands each 10cm, making up a net for mapping the sampled individuals in two distinct periods; before fire treatment and then two years after that. Twenty four species and 12 families were sampled for both inventories. The families with greater species richness were: Rubiaceae (6), Fabaceae (4) e Myrtaceae (4). The floristic similarity found was 35% and the species with higher cover value were: Sorocea bomplandii, Psychothria sessilis, and Anadenanthera macrocarpa. There was no meaningful reduction in the species density between the samplings, the same cannot be considered for the Shannon diversity index. The individuals sampled belonged to shrubby or woody vegetation, with resprouting being the key mechanism for this fragment regeneration.

AB  - The current study aimed to analyse the tree species natural regeneration floristic composition in a Mountain Seasonal Semideciduous Forest fragment in the domain of the Atlantic Forest, in southeastern Brazil (20°45'S, 42°55'W) in order to subsidize secondary natural forest management. Ten sites were selected based on their aspects, slopes and topographic positions. Natural regeneration indexes were estimated for each tree species per size classes to obtain the Total Natural Regeneration Index (TNR) for each species. It was sampled a total of 3,516 individuals of 140 tree species varying from 10 cm to 5 m height with diameter at the height of 1.3 m (DBH) smaller than 5 cm. The largest numbers of individuals were sampled in the families Rubiaceae, Fabaceae Mimosoideae, Monimiaceae, Fabaceae Papilionoideae, and the richest families were Fabaceae Caesalpinoideae, Fabaceae Papilionoideae, Euphorbiaceae, Lauraceae, Myrtaceae and Rubiaceae. Psychotria sessilis, Siparuna guianensis, Anadenanthera peregrina and Piptadenia gonoacantha presented the largest TNR. The comparison of the actual regeneration study with that of prior evaluations suggests a continuous substitution of species from initial to more advanced stages. These results indicate that the protection of the remaining forest fragments is important to maintain or improve the biodiversity in this region.

AB  - For the current study, 10 plots measuring 20×50 meters were created in the city of Frederico Westphalen, in the state of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. All plants within these plots with a diameter at breast height (DBH) of ≥ 5 cm were identified, resulting in a total of 1,461 plants per hectare. The floristic composition revealed 79 species belonging to 31 families and 69 genera. The Fabaceae was the richest family in this study, having 14 species. Other families which presented a great number of species were the Myrtaceae (8), Meliaceae (6), Euphorbiaceae (5), Sapindaceae (5), Rutaceae (4) and Salicaceae (4). The species with the greatest importance values (IV) were the Gymnanthes concolor, Nectandra megapotamica, Trichilia claussenii and Chrysophyllum marginatum. The Shannon Diversity index and the Pielou Equability index were 3.49 nats. ind. -1 and 0.79, respectively. A Twinspan classification analysis indicated three floristic subgroups in the forest patch. From these three groups, one was physionomically distinct because of its lower canopy and the predominance of tree fern species. The other two ones were characterized by tree species such as the Trichilia claussenii and Gymnanthes concolor, which are responsible for the large physiognomic group that characterized advanced secondary succession forests.

AB  - Perceptual range is one of the main determinants of dispersal success in fragmented landscapes, which are composed of scattered remnants of original habitat in a matrix of variable composition. How perceptual range varies according to land use is essential information to estimate the functional connectivity of landscapes. We determined for the first time how different types of land use affect the perceptual range of a species, using as model organisms two neotropical marsupials endemic to the Atlantic Forest in Brazil (Philander frenatus and Didelphis aurita). We released and tracked the movements of 196 individuals in three types of land use commonly found in fragmented landscapes: manioc plantation, mowed pasture and abandoned pasture. We also determined how orientation to the nearest forest fragment is affected by distance to the fragment, wind speed, body mass and sex using a model selection approach. The type of land use affected the perceptual ranges of both marsupials. The estimated perceptual ranges for P. frenatus and D. aurita were 100 and 200m in the mowed pasture, respectively, 50 and <30m in the abandoned pasture and 30 and 50m in the plantation. The orientation of both species decreased with increasing distance to the fragment, but for D. aurita orientation also increased with the wind speed and body mass. These results agree with previous studies depicting a general pattern of increased perceptual range with lower vegetation obstruction in the matrix and larger body mass and wind speed, depending on the use of visual versus olfactory cues by animals. Our findings allow more realistic estimates of functional connectivity in fragmented landscapes based on basic information on the biology of each species and the type of matrix. © 2011 The Authors.

AB  - This study was conducted in the Cachoeira River Natural Reserve, in Antonina, Paraná state, Brazil. The main goal was to assess the litter production of secondary tropical rain forests in different sucessional stages (initial, medium and advanced stages). The litter fall was collected every 3 weeks during four years (2004 to 2007), in circular litter traps of 0.25m2, distributed in 30 plots of 100m2 of area. A total of 60 litter traps were installed in an area of 3000m2. The litter fall collected at each retrieval date was dried, separated into fractions (leaves, twigs, reproductive organs and miscellaneous) and weighed. Leaves of some tree species were selected from the total litter for a specific study of their contribution to the total litter. The average annual litter production for the three years was 5201, 5399 and 5323 kg.ha-1.year-1, and the percentage contribution of the leaf fraction was 77, 75 and 68%, in the initial, medium and advanced sucessional stages, respectively. The leaf litter fraction produced in the initial stage was dominated by the species Tibouchina pulchra (jacatirão) (75%), but in the medium and advanced stages the dominance of only one tree species in leaf litter fraction did not occur. The production of twigs and reproductive organs did not differ statistically among the sucessional stages. The production of miscellaneous fraction was higher in the advanced stage and did not differ between the initial and medium stages. In general, the differences in litter production were little along the sucessional stage in the area of the study.

AB  - Riparian forests are important for the structure and functioning of stream ecosystems, providing structural components such as large woody debris (LWD). Changes in these forests will cause modifications in the LWD input to streams, affecting their structure. In order to assess the influence of riparian forests changes in LWD supply, 15 catchments (third and fourth order) with riparian forests at different conservation levels were selected for sampling. In each catchment we quantified the abundance, volume and diameter of LWD in stream channels; the number, area and volume of pools formed by LWD and basal area and tree diameter of riparian forest. We found that riparian forests were at a secondary successional stage with predominantly young trees (diameter at breast height <10 cm) in all studied streams. Results showed that basal area and diameter of riparian forest differed between the stream groups (forested and non-forested), but tree density did not differ between groups. Differences were also observed in LWD abundance, volume, frequency of LWD pools with subunits and area and volume of LWD pools. LWD diameter, LWD that form pools diameter and frequency of LWD pools without subunits did not differ between stream groups. Regression analyses showed that LWD abundance and volume, and frequency of LWD pools (with and without subunits) were positively related with the proportion of riparian forest. LWD diameter was not correlated to riparian tree diameter. The frequency of LWD pools was correlated to the abundance and volume of LWD, but characteristics of these pools (area and volume) were not correlated to the diameter of LWD that formed the pools. These results show that alterations in riparian forest cause modifications in the LWD abundance and volume in the stream channel, affecting mainly the structural complexity of these ecosystems (reduction in the number and structural characteristics of LWD pools). Our results also demonstrate that riparian forest conservation actions must consider not only its extension, but also successional stage to guarantee the quantity and quality of LWD necessary to enable the structuring of stream channels. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

AB  - Luehea divaricata Mart. & Zucc. of the Malvaceae family, is a forest tree species that has suffered great anthropic disturbance during the last decades. This fact has contributed to the reduction of natural populations and, consequently, of its genetic variability. This justifies studies related to the propagation of the species. As a means of vegetative propagation, micropropagation is an alternative for the regeneration of plants with difficult natural regeneration and a strategy for species conservation. The objectives of this study were to determine the most efficient type of explant and growth medium for in vitro establishment and verify the influence of different concentrations of BAP cytokinin in the multiplication of nodal segments of Luehea divaricata. The seeds used were collected and stored by the Fundação Estadual de Pesquisa Agropecuária - FEPAGRO/Florestas (Agriculture and Cattle Research State Foundation - FEPAGRO/Forests), in Santa Maria, RS, Brazil, and the seedlings obtained in vitro were used as sources of the explants. In the selection of the explants and growth medium, the shoot apical and nodal segments grown in the MS and WMP nutritive media were tested. Different concentrations of BAP (0, 5, 10 and 15 mg L-1) were evaluated in the in vitro multiplication of the species. In the in vitro establishment of Luehea divaricata, both shoot apical and nodal segments can be used and also both growth media. To maximize the growth of the species, the WPM growth medium should be used due to its reduced cost. In the in vitro multiplication of the species, cytokinin BAP should not be added because, besides reducing the costs in the in vitro cultivation of Luehea divaricata, the best response for the majority of the characteristics evaluated was observed in the absence of this regulator,.

AB  - Ants are among the most common arthropods that colonize termite nests. The aim of this study was to identify the ant fauna associated to termite nests found in a cacao plantation in the county of Ilhéus, Bahia, Brazil, with emphasis on the fauna that uses the nests as foraging and/or nesting environment. For this purpose, 34 active, decadent and abandoned nests of Nasutitermes corniger, N. ephratae and Nasutitermes sp., with different volumes and degrees of activity, were dissected. A total of 54 ant species, belonging to 23 genera and five subfamilies, was found in the constructions. The active, decadent and abandoned termite nests presented, respectively, six, eight and 48 ant species. Crematogaster acuta and Ectatomma tuberculatum were the most frequent species in the active and decadent nests, respectively, while the most frequent species in the abandoned nests were Solenopsis pollux, Thaumatomyrmex contumax and Thaumatomyrmex sp. Twenty-six ant species had true colonies within the termitaria. The Formicidae species richness in the nests was inversely related to the degree of termite activity in the nests. The occurrence of living, decadent or abandoned termitaria of Nasutitermes spp. in cacao plantations foments the heterogeneity of habitats available in the plantations and favors the maintenance of high diversity of organisms that use obligatory or opportunistically this substrate.

AB  - Uncertainties remain in the use of remote sensing technologies to provide validated model-derived estimates of the biomass of the secondary succession (SS) forests in the Amazon Basin. The objectives of this study were to develop a modeling framework for creating a valid spectrum-biomass model to estimate the SS biomass, to assess the utility of the framework and the accuracy and validity of the model, and to identify the model's determinants. Data sources for this study include 1992-1993 vegetation inventory data and 1991 Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) data on the Altamira region of Para, Brazil, and 1994-1995 vegetation inventory data and 1994 Landsat TM data on the nearby Bragantina region. The allometric approach was used to estimate the biomass of the sampled sites based on the vegetation inventory data. A framework for the spectrum-biomass regression model was developed based on the estimated biomass of the sampled sites and the Landsat data. The framework includes (1) the pooling of data from Bragantina and the use of ANCOVA to justify this approach; (2) image calibration; (3) biomass data age-adjustment, (4) selection of independent variables, (5) regression model development, and (6) model assessment and validation. The cubic regression model with TM Band5-related predictors was found to best fit the data as evidenced by an adjusted R-squared value of 0.865, mean square error (MSE) of the model, and the analysis of residuals. Residual analysis showed that the model might yield a better estimation on a lower biomass values than on higher biomass values. In addition, further analyses identified several determinants that can impact the accuracy of the spectrum-biomass model. ANCOVA confirmed that the relationship between the biomass and the spectrum is independent of the Altamira and Bragantina regions, and that it was appropriate to pool sampled data from both regions in the proposed model. The model development methodology and the model produced from this research will be of value to researchers using the spectrum-biomass modeling approaches to estimate the biomass and study the SS rates in moist tropical forests.

AB  - The ecosystems occurring on dystrophic soils, such as sandy soils, are highly dependent on nutrients from the atmosphere and those cycled by their own biota. Nutrient inputs from rainfall and throughfall were measured between October 2001 and August 2003 in a secondary Atlantic rainforest in southern Brazil. Canopy interception (rainfall minus throughfall) was 17.3% of the annual rainfall of 2,235 mm. Monthly interception ranged from 12 to 31% during the rainiest months (precipitation above 200 mm) and from 1 to 45% during the driest months (precipitation below 50 mm) indicating relatively high variability during this period. The studied site may be susceptible to water stress in this period due to the high permeability of the sandy soil. Approximately 80% of the Ca and Na and 57% of Mg were mainly from rainfall (bulk deposition) whereas the main input source for K was net throughfall (about 78%). Mean annual inputs via throughfall (in kg ha-1) were: 90.6 for Na, 29.1 for K, 7.1 for Ca, and 2.9 for Mg. The highest nutrient inputs occurred during the rainy season. Na fluxes were relatively high, while K, Ca, and Mg inputs were low, compared with other tropical and subtropical forests. Information on nutrient fluxes for different forest ecosystems are fundamental for building up a database that can give support to environmental diagnosis, to forest management, and to conservation and restoration techniques. © 2010 The Japanese Forest Society and Springer.

AB  - This study aimed to evaluate the structure of the tree community of a submontane atlantic rain forest at the Imbaú region, Silva Jardim, RJ. We tested the hypothesis that forest fragmentation causes a reduction in species richness and diversity in these fragments. Four replicate plots of 100 × 5 m were systematically located in each of the five forest fragments. All trees with DBH > 5 cm were measured (DBH and height) and identified. The most important families were Meliaceae, Sapindaceae, and Fabaceae. Amongst species, Guarea guidonia and Cupania oblongifolia occurred with high values of importance. These species had not been reported as important species in other fragments already analyzed for the same region. The fragments showed a predominance of early secondary species, as a consequence of forest fragmentation process, and indicating a secondary succession stage. The Shannon diversity index (H’) varied from 2.82 to 3.62 nats.ind-1 between fragments, and can be considered within the range found for other secondary Atlantic forests. However, when considered all fragments together, the diversity index was close to values found for mature forests (4.0 nats.ind-1), supporting the initial hypothesis. These results suggest that the Imbaú region still has an expressive species richness and diversity, indicating its importance for conservation of the local woody flora. © 2018 Instituto de Pesquisas Jardim Botanico do Rio de Janeiro.All right reserved.

AB  - Planting seedlings is a common technique for abandoned pastures restoration in the tropics, supposedly by increasing the seedling recruitment and accelerating succession. In this study we evaluated the role of a young restored forest (one year old) in enhancing seedling establishment from two sources (seed rain and seed bank), in the Atlantic Rainforest region in Southern Brazil. We compared abandoned pasture, young restored forest and old-growth forest with respect to the seedlings recruited from different sources, by monitoring 40 permanent plots (0.5m×0.5m) over 20 months. From the three studied areas a total of 392 seedlings of 53 species were recruited. Species were mainly herbaceous (85%), pioneers (88%), zoochorous (51%) and small-seeded species (60%). Seedling recruitment from the seed bank (density and species richness) was higher and dominated by herbaceous species in the abandoned pasture and in the young restored forest; on the other hand, the recruitment of woody species from seed rain was more pronounced in the old-growth forest. The young restored forest increased the species richness of woody seedlings recruitment from the seed bank (two-fold) and from seed rain (three-fold) compared to the abandoned pasture. Also, the seedling density in young restored forest was still higher than abandoned pastures (seed bank: four times; seed rain: ten times). Our results show that even young restored areas enhance the establishment of woody species and should be considered an important step for pasture restoration.

AB  - The objective of this research was to analyze the seed bank of a forest remnant and two pasture areas, with 17 and 27 years of age, in the city of Alta Floresta, Mato Grosso, Brazil. To evaluate the seed bank of the three areas, 8 samples were randomly collected for each area, with 4 subplots. Evaluations of the individuals regenerated on the 60th and 120th day were made. In the first evaluation, 448, 217 and 89 individuals m-2 germinated in the pasture with 27 and 17 years of age and in the forest remnant, respectively. On the 120th day, 285 individuals m-2 regenerated in the pasture with 27 years of age, 243 individuals m-2 in the pasture with 17 years of age and 264 individuals m-2 in the forest remnant. In pasture areas with 17 and 27 years of age the seed bank is dominated by herbaceous species, and there is no more seeds of tree species deposited in the seed bank, which could be used for reforestation of the disturbed land.

AB  - We know surprisingly little about the fate of seeds of the Brazil nut tree (Bertholletia excelsa) under natural conditions. Here we investigate seed removal, predation and caching of Brazil nuts by scatter-hoarding rodents in the wet and dry seasons, based on an experimental approach using 900 thread-marked seeds. We tracked the fate of seeds handled by these animals to examine how seasonal food availability may influence caching rates, dispersal distances and cache longevity. Most seeds exposed to dispersal trials were removed by scatter-hoarders during the first week in both seasons and seeds were generally buried intact in single-seeded caches within 10 m of seed stations. Seeds were removed significantly faster and buried at greater distances during the dry season. The proportion of seeds buried intact was considerably higher in the wet season (74.4%) than in the dry season (38.2%). Most (99.4%) of the 881 primary caches monitored were recovered, but these had a significantly shorter lifetime in the dry season. Our results show that rodents are highly skilled at retrieving buried Brazil nuts and that caching behaviour appears to be affected by seasonal resource abundance. Reduced seed availability due to intensive harvest could potentially create a dry-season scenario where most seeds succumb to pre-dispersal predation, thereby adversely affecting the natural regeneration of Brazil nut trees.

AB  - This work examines patches of Atlantic forests in Minas Gerais State where woolly spider monkeys (Brachyteles hypoxanthus) are inhabitants in order to understand the effects of forest structure, diversity, and succession in B. hypoxanthus abundance. This study was carried out in three reserves: Rio Doce State Park (PERD), Mata do Sossego (Sossego), and Serra do Brigadeiro State Park (PESB). Structural studies were carried out by means of point-centered quarter samples in areas used by woolly spider monkeys. Evenness was lower in PERD than in the other two communities. By means of successional functional groups analysis and diametric structure, the PERD forest sample was shown to be in the later, and PESB forest sample in the earlier, stages of secondary succession. We found that tree species evenness and structural traits driven by succession were important factors in determining spider monkey abundance patterns. The PERD forest sample had lower evenness and had lower density of woolly spider monkeys than the Sossego forest sample. The lowest density of these primates was in the PESB forest sample, the earlier successional stage of secondary succession of this study. © The Ecological Society of Japan 2009.

AB  - Studying the physical environment of a watershed is the basic condition for a successful planning of the riparian forest preservation, and for water production and conservation. The aims of the present study were to analyze and quantify the spatial and temporal evolution (1984 and 2010) using Landsat-5 satellite images of Cintra Stream sub-watershed, Botucatu, São Paulo State, Brazil, processed by the software IDRISI Andes, as well as to analyze the water quality through the parameters pH, EC, DO and BOD5 at 4 different sites in the years 1999, 2008 and 2009. Considering the 1076.48ha area of the sub-watershed, the pasture class of 1984 was reduced by 25.55% in 2010, resulting in an increase in the remaining classes. The most important class was native forest and reforestation since it had an increase of 5.08%, which indicates recovery of the riparian forest. Degraded areas were identified close to the inferior limit of the sub-watershed (P3 and P4), as well as local contamination (P1 and P2) with worsening of the water quality in the remaining sites in the periods 2008 and 2009. Recovery and management of the ecological succession of degraded areas and water quality monitoring at 1 and 2 sites will be necessary to reestablish the natural condition of the area studied.

AB  - Plantations of native-tree species are often recommended for ecological restoration, but the understanding of how these techniques catalyze natural ecological processes is limited. We investigated natural regeneration in five plantations of native trees in the Poço das Antas Biological Reserve (PABR) in the state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The plantations were 9-11 years old, and contained 8-14 native-tree species with different compositions and relative density of species. We analyzed floristic composition, structure (density and basal area) of overstory and understory strata, as well as other ecological attributes (dispersal syndromes, fruit or seed size, and the availability of fruit for frugivores). Zoochorous species comprised 77% of the community, with a prevalence of the two smallest size classes of propagules (< 0.6 and 0.6-1.6 cm) in natural regeneration. The density of zoochorous plants in the understory was positively correlated with their density in the overstory, indicating their influence on natural regeneration (r2 = 0.36; p < 0.0002). Fruit availability for frugivores (density and richness of plants fruiting during the year) was also positively correlated with the density of stems in the understory. Therefore, attributes such as dispersal syndrome and fruiting season should be considered in selecting species to be planted. The differences in natural regeneration observed in each of the native-tree plantations indicated that the performance of plantations as a restoration strategy may differ, depending on initial species composition, planting density, and site conditions. © 2009 Society for Ecological Restoration International.

AB  - We evaluated density and species composition of the soil seed bank in active pasture and in secondary forest on a 10 year-old abandoned pasture to identify changes in density, richness, diversity and species composition during secondary succession of abandoned pastures. The implications of those changes for the forest recovery process were also considered. Soil samples were collected at Porto Rico island, state of Paraná, in 2007. The seedling emergence method was used. Data on active pasture collected in 1996, published by Campos and Souza (2003) were used for comparative analysis. No evidence was found of a pattern of changes in density of the soil seed bank during succession of abandoned pastures. We observed increases in richness and diversity, in the contribution of tree and shrub species and dominance of herb species for the seed bank during the first 10 years of abandonment of pastures in riparian forests. At the end of succession, the soil used as pasture can result in systems that are different from the original environment, due to seed bank impoverishment and presence of exotic species.

AB  - Isolated forest fragments are subject to natural and anthropogenic disturbances that can alter forest properties. Native bamboo species are favored by disturbances. Few studies have attempted to demonstrate the influence of bamboos regarding the availability of soil seed bank and their implications for management. The present study aims to evaluate whether the dominance and the maintenance of the forest in the early stages of succession has been facilitated by the structure of the local seed bank within an urban fragment of Atlantic forest in Brazil. We also evaluated the forest regeneration potential of the soil seed bank under a bamboo-dominated area and a control area. A total of 5181 (units) seeds were germinated, corresponding to 81 plant species in 31 families. Miconia cf. cinnanomifolia was the most abundant species in the seed bank for both forests (72.6% in control and 43.9% in bamboo-dominant). Despite the low diversity and evenness found in both areas, the seed bank in the bamboo-dominated area had higher species richness and diversity, and a heterogeneous floristic composition of shrub and tree species when compared to the control area. In both areas early-successional species of trees and shrubs dominated the seed bank (>90%). The results are discussed in terms of the regeneration ability, and it is suggested that in spite the area being a remnant with disturbed forest patches invaded by bamboos, the soil seed bank still represents an important seed source for forest regeneration. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - During forest succession, litterfall nutrient fluxes increase significantly. The higher inputs of organic matter and nutrients through litterfall affects positively soil fertility and the species composition, which are essential components in forest restoration and management programs. In the present study, the input of nutrients to the forest soil via litterfall components was estimated for two sites of different development stages, in an early successional alluvial rain forest in Brazil. Litterfall returned to the soil, in kg/ha, ca. 93 N, 79 Ca, 24 K, 15 Mg, 6 P, 1.7 Mn, 0.94 Fe, 0.18 Zn, 0.09 Cu and 11.2 Al, in the site where trees were more abundant and had higher values of basal area. In the other area, where trees where less abundant and values of ba sal area were comparatively low, litterfall returned <50% of those amounts to the forest soil, except for Al. The amount of Al that returned to the soil was similar in both areas due to the high contribution of Tibouchina pulchra (82% of Al returned). Comparatively, high proportion of three dominant native tree species (Myrsine coriacea, T. pulchra and Cecropia pachystachya) explained better litter nutrient use efficiency (mainly N and P) in the site with the least advanced successional stage. Although litterfall of these species show lower nutrient concentrations than the other tree species, their nutrient fluxes were high in both sites, indicating a certain independence from soil essential nutrients. Such feature of the native species is very advantageous and should be considered in forest restoration programs.

AB  - Forest edges are permanently under pressure by natural factors and disturbances, such as fire, which can cause changes in plant communities. We studied nature and extension of damages and also the resilience of the plant community after fire in the seasonal semideciduous forest, at Estação Ecológica de Caetetus, Galia municipality, São Paulo State, Brazil. Vegetation survey comprised five transects 50 m long (10 m wide) from the edge to the forest interior in the burnt forest, and the same area in the unburnt continuous forest, used for comparisons. Every transect was divided in five 10 × 10 m plots. Tree species were identified and measured from a minimum height of 1.7 meter. Vegetation cover of every life form was assessed by line interception method in every plot. Data were collected at six, 15 and 24 months after fire and separately analysed for the external strip (0-20 m from the edge) and internal strip (20-50 m). Structural changes were larger at the external strip, where arboreal biomass was totally lost, while 11% remained in the internal strip. The difference in species number was high in the first evaluation after fire - 43 species less in the burnt forest, but decreased to only 14 species after 24 months, a demonstration of high resilience in terms of arboreal species richness. Biomass recovery take longer at the external strip (11 years estimated) compared to the internal strip (five years).

AB  - This study examines how habitat structure affects the home range use of a group of Brachyteles hypoxanthus in the Brigadeiro State Park, Brazil. It has been reported that most of the annual feeding time of woolly spider monkeys is spent eating leaves, but they prefer fruits when available. We hypothesise that the protein-to-fibre ratio (PF; best descriptor of habitat quality for folivorous primates) is a better descriptor of habitat quality and abundance for these primates than the structural attributes of forests (basal area is the best descriptor of habitat quality for frugivorous primates of Africa and Asia). We evaluated plant community structure, successional status, and PF of leaf samples from the dominant tree populations, both within the core and from a non-core area of the home range of our study group. Forest structure was a combination of stem density and basal area of dominant tree populations. The core area had larger trees, a higher forest basal area, and higher stem density than the non-core area. Mean PF did not differ significantly between these sites, although PF was influenced by differences in tree regeneration guilds. Large-bodied monkeys could be favoured by later successional stages of forests because larger trees and denser stems prevent the need for a higher expenditure of energy for locomotion as a consequence of vertical travel when the crowns of trees are disconnected in early successional forests. Forest structure variables (such as basal area of trees) driven by succession influence woolly spider monkey abundance in a fashion similar to frugivorous monkeys of Asia and Africa, and could explain marked differences in ranging behaviour and home range use by B. hypoxanthus.

AB  - In the present study, we describe the temporal and spatial variability in recruitment, growth, and mortality rates of seedlings and saplings of two low-density neotropical tree species, Dipteryx odorata and Copaifera reticulata in Eastern Amazonia, Brazil. As both species have important timber and non-timber uses, for each species we compare regeneration parameters among different management scenarios (sites used for timber logging, non-timber product extraction, and undisturbed forests). Results suggest that both species share similar natural regeneration characteristics. These include temporally and spatially asynchronous germination, existence of individuals that have more abundant and frequent fruit production than the average of the population and a positive influence of the mother tree crown on seedling and sapling density. The management activities analyzed did not influence the regeneration parameters of both species, which suggests that timber logging the way it was performed and current rates of D. odorata seed gathering and C. reticulata tapping at the study site are not sufficiently intense to threaten species population. However, some species characteristics, such as their reproductive strategies, light-demanding syndromes, low-dispersal ranges, and high-mortality rates of seedlings make both species vulnerable to exploitation. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - Fine root morphological traits and distribution, arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi, soil fertility, and nutrient concentration in fine root tissue were compared in sites under different successional phases: grass plants, secondary forest, and mature forest in Londrina county, Paraná state, southern Brazil. Soil cores were collected randomly at the 0-10- and 10-20-cm depths in three quadrants (50 m2) in each site. Plants from the different successional stages displayed high differences in fine root distribution, fine root traits, and mycorrhizal root colonization. There were increases in the concentration of nutrients both in soil and fine roots and decrease of bulk soil density along the succession. The fine root biomass and diameter increased with the succession progress. The total fine root length, specific root length, root hair length, and root hair incidence decreased with the succession advance. Similarly, the mycorrhizal root colonization and the density of AM fungi spores in the soil decreased along the succession. Mycorrhizal root colonization and spore density were positively correlated with fine root length, specific root length, root hair length, root hair incidence, and bulk density and negatively correlated with fine root diameter and concentration of some nutrients both in soil and root tissues. Nutrient concentration in root tissue and in soil was positively correlated with fine root diameter and negatively correlated with specific root length, root hair length, and root hair incidence. These results suggest different adaptation strategies of plant roots for soil exploration and mineral acquisition among the different successional stages. Early successional stages displayed plants with fine root morphology and AM fungi colonization to improve the root functional efficiencies for uptake of nutrients and faster soil resource exploration. Late successional stages displayed plants with fine root morphology and mycorrhizal symbiosis for both a lower rate of soil proliferation and soil exploration capacity to acquire nutrients. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - The expansion of agricultural and pasture areas over native forest areas has been broadly documented and represents the main cause of deforestation that has occurred for the last decades. Such reality is not different in indigenous lands, and has been considered as an important obstacle for individuals who directly depend upon the appropriate management of natural resources to maintain their traditions. We investigated the seed rain, seed bank and natural regeneration of native woody species within a degraded pasture land in different distances from an adjacent seasonal semideciduous forest fragment to define methodological procedures based on ecological processes that might subsidize forest restoration in an indigenous land. Most seeds and seedlings picked from the seed rain and seed bank belonged to anemochoric and autochoric dispersing shrubby and herbaceous species originated in the pasture land. The woody species regeneration, on the other hand, reached higher levels, in terms of abundance and richness, as the forest fragment became closer. Zoochoric dispersal was predominant among such species and was mainly detected closer to the forest fragment. Several woody species picked in the forest fragment were also found in the pasture land, thus reinforcing their important role in supplying propagules and easing the successional process. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This study describes changes within the Leguminosae plant family along two to 25 years of secondary succession after slash-and-burn agriculture and compares regrowth with mature rain forest legume species composition. Research was conducted on a 21-site (12.9 ha) chronosequence and covered all legume plants > 50 cm height. Legume biomass shares ranged from 4-8% in secondary regrowth and were two to four times higher in mature rain forest (17%, or 78 tons ha-1). Legume taxonomic composition differed strongly between secondary and mature rain forests, and floristic similarity (Jaccard's coefficient) of legumes between both forest types was only 34%. Successional changes in legume vegetation shares and taxonomic composition were weak within secondary regrowth, though repeated slash-and-burn did affect legume vegetation. Legume functional composition changed along succession with high shares of potentially N2-fixing lianas in young regrowth. We conclude that 1) the composition of legume species in the community differs strongly between secondary and mature rain forest but legume composition along regrowth does not provide an adequate criterion for the definition of optimum fallow periods, and 2) legume lianas assume a key functional role in biological N2- fixation and ecosystem N-cycling especially early along succession.

AB  - The loss of natural forests due to the anthropic pressure carried the secondary forests to occupy great proportions of areas in East of Amazon. With the aim to known the characteristics of a arboreal community and the population structure of the most representative species, it were investigated species richness, structure, and floristic composition of a 40 years old secondary forest in the municipality of Bragança (01° 11'S and 46° 40'W), Pará State, Brazil. It was sampled all individuals of arboreal species (except Arecaceae) with DBH ≥ 5 cm in 150 plots of 10×10 m. It was registered 2,934 individuals in 154 species, 101 genera and 40 families. The density was 1,956.00 ± 643.45 ind. ha-1 and the basal area of 17.358 ± 7.952 m2 ha-1 with a Shannon diversity index of 4,030 nats. ind.-1. The species with the highest abundance of individuals were Myrcia bracteata, Casearia arborea, and Maprounea guianensis. The species with the highest basal area were Tapirira guianensis, Croton matourensis, and Maprounea guianensis. The richness of species fitted to the lognormal distribution model just for basal area and not for number of individuals. In 40 years of succession, this forest shows high species diversity and low basal area.

AB  - Since the campus of the Federal University of Juiz de Fora, Minas Gerais State, Brazil, has different landscapes, it turns up to be a useful ecological model to evaluate the influence of habitat heterogeneity on bird communities. Our research goals were to know the local avifauna and compare its composition and bird diversity within the different landscapes. Species were identified in point counts without distance estimation, in four habitats: secondary woodlot, lake and surroundings, scrub/abandoned grazing areas and urban areas. One hundred and twenty-one species were identified, but no difference in diversity among the habitats was found. However, analyses indicated the existence of greater similarities among the sampling points belonging to the same kind of habitat. Results suggests that small and isolated forest fragments in urban areas fail to sustain a greater diversity than the adjacent areas, even though the environment's heterogeneous aspect favours local bird richness.

AB  - In November 2005 we found an active nest of Dendrocolaptes platyrostris inside the roof of a five-year-old research facility partly surrounded by forest remnants in the state of Parana, Brazil. The nest, measuring 1.8 × 1.0 m, was composed basically by pieces (up to 24.5 cm) of Araucaria angustifolia bark. Both parents fed insects to the three nestlings, whose fate could not be monitored. In September 2006 we examined the roof again and found an apparently abandoned egg (31.5 × 24.0 mm) in a reformed nest measuring 0.90 × 0.50 m. This seems to be the first breeding record of D. platyrostris in a semi-rural building.

AB  - In this work the re-fixation of mobilized copper (Cu) that was released from a deactivated pilot Cu ore dressing plant in the tropical rain forest at Southeastern Amazon (Carajás) was studied. Samples of top soils, decay leaf litter deposited on soils, roots and leaves of standing biomass were taken for the determination of Cu concentration in order to evaluate the distribution of it between different environmental compartments. In the sampling points near to the now extinct plant, total Cu concentrations in the soil reached an average value of 2140 μg g-1 above the natural level of about 40 μg g-1, being that bioavailable Cu estimated by DTPA method varied from 1.9 to 20.7% of this total. From the data was possible to calculate that the soil compartment is able to hold around 10 kg Cu/m2 of ground. Roots of the standing biomass in that area hold around 17 g Cu/m2, while the Cu content in leaves showed to be largely independent of the Cu level in the soil. Copper in the leaves was estimated as around 1 g/m2 of ground area. In turn, the decay leaf litter deposited on soil can hold about 1.6 g Cu/m2. The terrestrial system surrounding the abandoned pilot plant demonstrated great buffer capacity to retain mobile Cu released by anthropogenic activities in the area. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The role of seed bank, seed rain, and regeneration from seedlings and sprouts after swidden agriculture was compared in 5-, 10- and 20-year-old secondary forest and in a primary forest in Bragantina, Pará, Brazil. The seed bank (0-5 cm soil depth) was largest in the 5-year-old forest (1190 ± 284 seeds m-2) and decreased nearly ten-fold with age to 137 ± 19 seeds m-2 in the primary forest. The highest seed rain was in the 5-year-old forest (883 ± 230 seeds m-2year -1) and the least in the primary forest (220 ± 80 seeds m -2year-1). Large plants (≥5 cm dbh) had more individuals and species that regenerated from sprouts than from seeds and the most abundant tree species in the secondary forest stands of all ages appear to be maintained by sprouting. The smaller individuals (≥1 m tall, <5 cm dbh) in the 5-year-old forest were mainly from sprouts, but those in the older secondary forests originated mainly from seeds. These results show that at the beginning of succession, although many species can be introduced to swidden fallow from seed bank and seed rain, it is the sprout that is the main source of recruits of primary forest species in secondary forests in Bragantina. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - This study objective was to evaluate the effective revegetation in a Mogi Guaçu River degraded floodplain area, located at Luiz Antonio municipality (21° 31' S e 47° 55' W), São Paulo State, Brazil. Two native riparian forest remnants (RIP1 and RIP2) and three 10-year-old reforested areas, planted of native species (R1, R2 and R3), were analyzed by using phytosociological describers of the arboreal stratum (trees with DBH ≥ 5 cm) as indicators. The arboreal stratum inventory was accomplished by 180 plots (10 × 10 m each), 60 representing every native forest and 20 for every reforested area. A total of 60 arboreal species was recorded, only six species (Cecropia hololeuca, Crotón urucurana, Genipa americana, Inga striata, Nectandra megapotamica e Peltophorum dubium) occurring in all the five studied areas. Seventeen species were common to both native forests, and nine species were recorded in all the reforested areas. Sebastlania commersonlana and Guarea macrophyllawere recorded in the native forests (RlP1 and RIP2), and Cecropia hololeuca, Croton urucurana and Inga striata occurring in all the reforested areas, were the species that best characterize the physiognomy of local diversity and were the most important among the studied species. The results showed that the rehabilitation of the areas made by the reforestation created conditions to implant forests with similar structures of the adjacent natural remainders. The reforestation with native species performed in the degraded floodplain of Mogi Guaçu River, initially with the predomination of invasive grasses, has been effective at the first stage of the ecological restoration process. The reforestation is making possible the natural regeneration of species from the adjacent remnants, what indicates that the similarity between planted forests and the native ones are rising through the time. The phytosociology, accomplished ten years after the planting date, is adequate to evaluate the effectiveness of the reforestation during the restoration process of degradated areas in the Mogi Guaçu floodplain.

AB  - The Araucaria forest is Brazil's highly threatened sub-tropical forest ecosystem that has been disappearing in recent decades. Restoration programs involving this forest type are scarce, and there is a lack of scientific information on how ecological processes such as competition, facilitation, and seed dispersal influence natural forest restoration. This work aims to investigate how use of perches to attract seed dispersers and the influence of pioneer vegetation and soil fertilization could affect the colonization of woody species in a degraded area. An experiment was conducted in an abandoned field where the natural establishment of seeds and seedlings of woody species was monitored under factorial combinations of the following treatments: (1) pioneer vegetation (presence and absence); (2) soil fertility (addition of NPK and control); and (3) perches (presence and absence). Seed and seedling abundance, seed and seedling species richness, and seedling mortality were recorded monthly during 12 months. Seed abundance and species richness were significantly greater in places with perches than in control plots. These results were consistent over the year and more pronounced when the surrounding forest produced a higher amount of fruit. Species richness and abundance of seedlings were significantly greater in places with perches than in control plots, and in places with vegetation than without. Soil fertility did not influence seedling establishment. Facilitation and seed dispersal are important factors affecting the colonization of woody species in this subtropical area. Nutrient availability neither regulates the facilitation process nor influences species replacement during the early stages of Araucaria forest succession. © 2005 Society for Ecological Restoration International.

AB  - This study was conducted at Mata do Pau-ferro State Ecological Reserve, Brejo Paraibano, Areia, Paraiba. Six regenerating sites were selected to evaluate structure and floristic composition of the forest at different ages: two sites were seven years old (C7); two were 15 (C15) and two were 20 (C20). The shrub-tree stratum and natural regeneration were surveyed in three plots (4x35 m) at each site. All individuals ≥ 0.2 m in height were identified by common name; diameter at ground level and total height were measured. We recorded 4997 individuals in 40 families, 74 genera and 90 species, in a total area of 2520 m2. The basal area of the forest at different ages was 2.5, 11.5 and 37.6 m2 ha-1 for C7, C15 e C20, respectively. The species with highest importance values at the three sites were: Diplotropis purpurea (Rich) Amchoff, Machaerium aculeatum Raddi, Erythroxylum pauferrense Plowman, Albizia polycephala (Benth.) Killip, Verbensina diversifolia DC., Allophylus laevigatus Radlk., Guapira opposita (Vell.) Reitz, Malouetia cestroides Muell. Arg. and Talisia esculenta (A. St.-Hil.) Radlk. We observed an increment in community complexity related to time after disturbance, resulting from incoming new species (higher richness), increased biomass (basal area), density and equitability. Our results indicate that the structure of the 20-year-old forest, as revealed by height-class distribution, is close to that expected for mature forests.

AB  - The relationships between arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and root morphological characteristics were studied under greenhouse conditions of 78 tropical native woody species and 47 seedling species collected in the field. Seedlings of native woody pioneer and early secondary species that generally exhibited fine roots with a dense cover of long root hairs showed higher mycorrhizal response and root mycorrhizal colonization than late-secondary and climax species with coarse roots with a sparse cover of short root hairs. Root-hair length and incidence decreased with the progression among the successional groups while fine-root diameter increased, both in the greenhouse and in the field. The mycorrhizal response was highly correlated to root mycorrhizal colonization in the greenhouse and in the field. These parameters were inversely correlated with the seed mass and fine-root diameter, but directly correlated with root-hair incidence, both in the greenhouse and in the field. Mycorrhizal response and root mycorrhizal colonization were also directly correlated with the root-hair length and root/shoot ratio of uninoculated plants. The seedling mycorrhizal status of the early successional woody species suggests that the root traits of these fast-growing species can be more receptive to attraction, infection and colonization by arbuscular mycorrhizas than root traits of late-successional species.

AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate qualitative and quantitatively the seed bank of two natural forest remainders, one Eucalyptus robusta plantation and three reforestation areas with native species, located in a riparian area of Mogi-Guaçu River floodplain, in Luiz Antonio County (21°31'S and 47°55'W), São Paulo State, Brazil. The evaluation was carried out in 12 plots of 10 × 10 m systematically distributed in each area. Four subplots of 0.5 m × 0.5 m were randomly distributed in each plot. Two subplots were used to evaluate the seed bank in the litter and two in the soil sample at the 0 - 5 cm depth. The sampling was accomplished in September 2001 in the natural forest remainders and in the eucalyptus plantation and, in September 2002, in the reforested areas. The soil and the litter were conditioned in plastic pots, and incubated with periodic irrigations for the seed germination during seven months, in two greenhouse environment conditions: one at 100% sunlight and the other, under a screen that provides a 70% sunlight reduction. In the composition of all sample area seed banks, there was a predomination of pioneer species at the early successional stages. The most important arboreal species were Aloysia virgata and Cecropia hololeuca. The reforestation with native species provided a seed bank with a greater diversity of native arboreal species than the eucalyptus plantation. The present study indicates that the similarity between the planted and natural forest should be enhanced over the time.

AB  - Transplanting seedlings and saplings from natural forests has been considered an alternative to producing saplings of native species for forest restoration purposes, but the possible impact of this procedure on plant community regeneration has not been investigated. This work evaluates the impact of different treatments of shrub and tree-seedling (up to 30 cm) removal from a seasonal semideciduous forest fragment located in southeastern Brazil on the natural regeneration process. Eighty 2×2 m plots were installed in two habitats (forest edge and interior) and submitted to four seedling-removal treatments (I, II - 100% removal with or without soil mixing; III - 50% removal without soil mixing; and IV - control treatment without seedling removal). Regeneration density and richness were evaluated before treatment as well as 6, 12 and 18 months later. The results were compared among treatments for each evaluation period and among periods within treatments. There were similarities between edge and interior. The natural regeneration process did not improve with soil mixing. Plots submitted to seedling removal partially recovered plant density; however, these plots had lower species richness when compared to the control and to the initial values before treatment. Seedling removal has a negative impact on the regeneration process of low-density species, thus the use of natural regeneration as a sapling source for forest restoration purposes should focus only on highdensity species with well-known regeneration strategies and not on the community as a whole.

AB  - Forest restoration projects are usually planted with a reduced number of species as compared to standing forests, largely due to the low availability of native species in seedling nurseries. In the present study, the potential of the native seedling community as a source of seedlings for forest restoration is analyzed. To do so, the seedling community from a forest fragment located in the southeast of Brazil was evaluated. Individuals (tree and shrub species) up to 30 cm height were measured and identified in 20 4 × 4 m plots. Altogether, 6,136 individuals (17 individuals m-2) belonging to 119 species were sampled. The seedling community showed a spatial heterogeneity with respect to the density of individuals and composition of species, and also a spatial aggregation for the 10 most abundant species. Several species that occurred in high densities in the seedling community are not presently available in regional forest nurseries and are therefore not used in restoration projects. This result and the high number of individuals and species found in the fragment suggest a great potential of this type of forest remnants as a source of highly diverse seedling banks for use in restoration projects.

AB  - The emergence of Brazilian extractive reserves reinforced the notion that sustainable forest use could play a central role in conservation. Brazil nut is considered a model non-timber product for promoting conservation through use. Demographic studies, however, have demonstrated differential impacts of nut harvest on Brazil nut population structure. Comparing three populations with different forest use histories, degrees of road access, and recent levels of nut harvest, we asked: (1) Are they exhibiting regeneration failure? and (2) Are seedling/sapling densities explained by adult Brazil nut structure, fruit fate and/or overall forest structure? We installed four 9-ha plots in each site to census Brazil nut trees ≥10 cm dbh, and within each plot, 36 subplots (25 × 25 m each) to quantify regeneration, overall forest structure, and open and closed fruit counts. Approximately 29-55% of fruits was unharvested, and more than 90% of these was opened by scatterhoarding dispersers. Population structure approximated a reverse-J size class distribution, with seedling densities varying from 3.2 to 5.8 individuals ha-1. We conclude that within the current harvest context, regeneration is sufficient for population persistence in our sites, at least over the medium term. The socioeconomics of sustainably managing Brazil nut is the greater challenge, involving interlinked competitive land uses, nut quality, and substantial increases in local income from harvest. Some of these challenges are being addressed in Brazil, Bolivia and Peru, providing hope that this cornerstone extractive species will continue to play a prominent role in the ecological and economic landscape of Amazonia. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The Chapada Diamantina National Park (CDNP) was created in the midst of a densely populated area, and significant sections of the reserve are still undergoing processes of natural regeneration after intensive diamond mining activities were initiated in the mid-1800's. An up-to-date vegetation map was needed in order to indicate the types and distribution of regional vegetation assemblages in an easily interpretable manner and at an appropriate planning scale that could be easily consulted by decision makers and other interested groups at all levels of conservation (and development) planning. A vegetation map of the Chapada Diamantina National Park, and the areas immediately surrounding it, was prepared that: 1) delimits, describes, and maps the regional vegetation assemblages; 2) provides an indication of the degree of conservation of the mapped vegetation; 3) develops this information in a format that facilitates continued updating and revision as more information becomes available, enabling the monitoring of the evolution of the Park lands, and; 4) presents this information in a manner that can be easily interpreted and used for planning, management and conservation purposes. The resulting vegetation map revealed intensive anthropogenic disturbances in forested, savanna, and semi-arid areas subjected to intensive agricultural use outside of the Park boundaries. The National Park lands are generally well preserved but burning has replaced formerly extensive forest areas with open sedge meadows. In spite of intensive modification of the regional vegetation, two well preserved areas with high priority for conservation efforts beyond the National Park limits were identified and characterized. The vegetation mapping of the park itself can aid in the preparation of its management plan and in the reformulation of the existing boundaries of that reserve.

AB  - Secondary succession in degraded areas is little studied, especially where long-term observation of evolutionary processes is concerned. The aim of this work was to follow the qualitative and quantitative changes in vegetation throughout the regeneration process after fire in a cerrado with forest physionomy. The area under study is a reserve on CPPSE-EMBRAPA's farm, São Carlos region of São Paulo State, Brazil. In 1981, an especially destructive fire eliminated the aerial part of the vegetation and litter. From that time, the vegetation in three permanent quadrats of 2 x 20 m was recorded for twenty years. The results demonstrated the rapid growth of herbs, shrubs, climbers and trees successively, with a great species richness and, after a certain time, a decline in density at a rate similar to the initial recovery. Both the soil seed bank and sprouting subterranean organs played important parts in the recovery of the vegetation. Three phases were observed in the plant succession: plant growth, followed by intraspecific competition with a reduction in the number of individuals and finally interspecific competition with the disappearance of some species from the quadrats. The different populations behaved similarly and the rise and fall in density of each species over time reflected their ecological role.

AB  - This article examines transformations associated with changes in resource use and land cover dynamics in the community of São Manoel, Maranhão state, in the eastern Brazilian Amazon. The shifting cultivator peasants in São Manoel integrate swidden fields for annual cropping, the extraction of babassu palm products, and pastures for cattle ranching. Since the early twentieth century, predominant vegetative cover patterns have been altered from species-rich mature forests to secondary succession with babassu dominant to pasture or swidden fields containing palm stands of various densities. A grounded political ecology of resource use in the area suggests that management strategies and the resulting land cover dynamics integrate site-specific decisions of peasant producers. I discuss the trajectory of production strategies in São Manoel since the establishment of the community in the 1920s, and identify the multiple dimensions affecting resource use and environmental outcomes, with an emphasis on the period following land struggles and the recovery of peasant tenure rights in the mid-1980s. The analysis indicates that socionatural trajectories that optimize resource use and address the socioeconomic needs of the community include the maintenance of palm/pastures associations. © 2005 Springer Science + Business Media, Inc.

AB  - The relative importance of sexual reproduction (seed) and sprouting as sources for regeneration in Brazilian Atlantic Forest was evaluated in three different successional forest stages: young forest, immature forest, and late-successional forest. Young plants (10-100 cm tall) of tree species were classified into the following categories: (1) seedlings that are nonsprouting - plants that originated through sexual reproduction as seeds; (2) stem base sprouting - plants that sprouted at the base of an existing plant; and (3) underground stem sprouting - plants that sprouted from subterranean stems of an existing plant. A total of 1,030 individuals of 48 species were collected. Underground stem sprouting is the rarest form of propagation, with stem base sprouting somewhat more common and possibly associated with recovery of damaged parts. The greatest contribution to regeneration was due to seeds: 92% of the individuals counted in 67% of the plant species. However, 13 species were "facultative"sprouters as seedlings and sprouters were observed in this group. The three forest ages differed in the proportion of regeneration strategies; in immature forest, sprouting was more common (15%) than in young (7%) and late-successional (3%; p < 0.05) forest. In these three forest stages, germinating seeds are the major source of new plants; although sprouting as a reproductive strategy is rare, it is related to recovery after damage of an already existing plant and may be due to previous land use history (agriculture) and low soil fertility. Restoration using natural regeneration should consider these factors to understand seed arrival as seed is the main source of regeneration. © 2007 Society for Ecological Restoration International.

AB  - In sampling accomplished in the drought station of 2002 in three pure forest populations constituted by: sabiá (Mimosa caesalpiniaefolia), sombreiro (Clitoria fairchildiana) and pinus (Pinus sp.) and, an area in initial process of ecological succession, 25 samples of soils were collected by area in two depths: 0-5 cm and 5-10 cm. The studied universe is located at the Balneary "O Quebra", Areia Municipal district, PB. The biggest seeds density always happened in the 0-5 cm depth, independent of the studied environment. The population of sombreiro showed the biggest stock of seeds, being verified 1,012 and 405 seeds germinated/m2 in the depths 0-5 cm and 5-10 cm, respectively. The seeds bank floristic composition was dominated by species of the Urticaceae family with more than 40% in the two studied depths. The more abundant life form was herbs, independent of the depth, followed by bushes and trees, in all the environments, except in the sombreiro population, where predominated bushes, followed by herbs and trees. Except the sombreiro population, all the studied environments present different densities of the seeds bank of the soil, in spite of being similar in floristic composition.

AB  - Two species of hubbardiid microwhipscorpions (Schizomida: Hubbardiidae) are recorded from the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. Rowlandius linsduarteae sp. nov. is described and illustrated based on specimens from Mata do Buraquinho forest reserve, João Pessoa, state of Paraíba, northeastern Brazil. This species is apparently related to Rowlandius sul Cokendolpher & Reddell 2000, the only species of the genus known from continental South America, and represents new evidence of a biogeographic relationship between Amazonia and the northeastern Brazilian Atlantic Forest. Stenochrus portoricensis Chamberlin, a widely distributed species, is newly recorded from the states of São Paulo and Bahia, respectively, in southeastern and northeastern Brazil. The latter record refers to several female specimens associated with abandoned arboreal termite nests in a cocoa plantation. Copyright © 2008 Magnolia Press.

AB  - Riparian forests are key to protect water resources and biodiversity, so that efforts and funds have been directed towards its restoration. Nine areas, reforested on the basis of secondary succession with different ages (one to 13 years), as well as a naturally regenerated forest 23 years old, are compared in this study, in terms of stand structure. The parameters adopted in this analysis were related to arboreal layer (biomass and fitossociology) and understory layer (density and richness). Planted forests presented a recovery process faster than the naturally regenerated stand, in terms of biomass. In this case, the values observed in the naturally regenerated forest (basal area = 15,05 m2.ha-1 ; crown cover = 184,3%) were not different from that observed in the reforested area aged three yeas old (basal area ranging from 15, 1 to 16,2 m2.ha-1 and crown cover from 159,2 to 291,2). The eldest planted forest (13 years old) is structurally similar to mature riparian forests in the same environmental condition, but its species richness (26 tree species) is lower than the value of mature forest (68 species). On the basis of these results, natural regeneration can be considered as a good technical solution to recover riparian forests only when costs are very limitative. Natural regeneration of arboreal species in the understory starts about seven years after planting and regenerating species are predominantly animal dispersed (46,6 to 95,6% of the plants), other than those which were planted.

AB  - The objective of this study is to analyze the graphic representation of polarimetric signatures of airborne SAR-R99B data (L-band) in primary forest, secondary successions, forest with timber exploitation and those under recovery after a surface burning process. Additionally, another objective is an exploratory analysis of scattering mechanisms of forest typology in accordance with the alternative procedure of SAR image classification based on target decomposition. The area under study is located at the Tapajós region (Brazil). At the representation of polarimetric signatures, the normalized cross-section of the forest target (σ) was plotted on a three-dimensional graphic as a function of the orientation angle, ellipticity angle, referring to the ellipse of polarization. The resulting surfaces were visually compared and the configuration of each plot was analyzed with support of physiognomic-structural information collected during forest inventories. On the other hand, the distinction between simple and multiple scattering mechanism from the target decomposition was done by the association of entropy and alpha angle values for each sample area. Some results can be mentioned: (a) from the analysis of polarimetric signatures one can verify that the primary forest sections present a relatively high pedestal when compared to the secondary succession. (b) for all thematic classes studied the pixel distribution in the (H, α) bidimensional space was more frequent at zones 5, 4 and 6 (decreasing frequency order). This study improves the understanding of the interaction mechanisms between L-band SAR signals and structural parameters of tropical rainforest, subsidizing the inventory and the monitoring of land cover in the Amazon region. © 2008 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing.

AB  - Seedling survival was evaluated regarding transplanted saplings obtained from natural regeneration of a Semideciduous Seasonal Forest fragment, located at Bofete, São Paulo State, Brazil. Shrub and trees species seedlings up to 30 cm height were collected from samples sited on a forest remnant, transplanted to a nursery under 50% shade tissue, and evaluated periodically during nine months. A total of 2,424 seedlings, belonging to 110 species were transferred to the nursery. Average survival reached 69%, although this survival rate was quite variable according to the species, families and height classes of the evaluated individuals. In spite of the fact that pioneer species presented higher survival rate, several non-pioneer species also obtained high values of survival. Besides, many of the survivor species are usually not available in forest nurseries of the São Paulo State. The transference of seedlings from natural regeneration of forest fragments to forest nurseries seems to be a complementary and a viable method in order to produce saplings of native species, increasing diversity within nurseries with forest restoration purposes.

AB  - Twelve native woody species were studied to investigate the influences of soil fertility and root morphology on colonization by arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi during seedling establishment and growth. Seedlings were grown in soils of low and high natural fertility, uninoculated or inoculated with AM fungi, under greenhouse conditions. The mycorrhizal root colonization and plant responsiveness were higher among early successional species than late successional ones. Among early successional species, in both soils, mycorrhizal colonization provided significant increase in total dry mass, growth rates of shoot and root, root length, density of root tissues, root surface area and P concentration and content in the shoot. Early successional species grown with AM fungi displayed significant decreases in carbon allocation to roots, specific root length and the length and incidence of root hairs. Mycorrhizal colonization did not affect the root morphology of the late successional species in either soil. The growth of these woody species was influenced by differences in soil fertility. There was positive correlation between the degree of plant responses to AM inoculation with the percentage of root colonized by AM fungi. In both soils, plant responsiveness and mycorrhizal root colonization correlated positively to root-hair incidence and root-hair length and correlated negatively to fine-root diameter. The results suggest that during the establishment of seedlings, the large responses to the inoculation and colonization of roots by AM fungi are related to both the successional status and root morphological plasticity of the host plant, regardless of soil fertility.

AB  - Balancing timber production and conservation in tropical forests requires an understanding of the impacts of silvicultural manipulations on specific groups of organisms. Lianas are characteristic of many tropical forests, where they contribute to species diversity, ecosystem functioning, and biomass. However, lianas can also impede timber production by increasing logging damage and slowing tree growth. Cutting lianas prior to logging can mitigate the negative effects, but may adversely affect a forest's value for conservation. To evaluate the effects of forest management activities on lianas, this study assessed the impacts of logging, both with and without pre-logging liana cutting, on the relative abundance and population structure of five species of lianas that differed in primary reproductive strategies. Inventories of the five study species were conducted 10 years following logging in 4.4 ha plots in three adjacent treatment areas: (1) an old-growth forest reserve, (2) a selectively-logged forest that used conventional practices for the region, and (3) a forest that was logged using reduced-impact logging (RIL) techniques including complete liana cutting prior to logging. Liana species responses to logging varied according to their primary modes of reproduction. Croton ascendens, a pioneer species with a persistent seed bank, had a higher abundance in the two logging treatments relative to the old-growth forest, while Serjania caracasana, an early successional species lacking a persistent seed bank, showed abundant regeneration following conventional logging but negligible regeneration following RIL. In contrast, Acacia multipinnata, also an early successional species, showed abundant regeneration following RIL owing to the sprouting of persistent prostrate stems present on the forest floor prior to logging. In both logged areas, Bauhinia guianensis recruited abundant climbing stems from self-supporting seedlings that were present prior to logging, but it showed greatly reduced seedling density following RIL. By sprouting profusely from both fallen stems and stumps, Memora schomburgkii recruited abundant small-diameter climbing stems in both of the logging treatments. The results of this study demonstrate that there are interspecific differences in liana responses to different types of logging and that knowing species' primary modes of reproduction is a valuable first step toward predicting those responses. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Growth and mortality of Sterculia pruriens, Vouacapoua americana, Jacaranda copaia, Protium paraensis, Newtonia suaveolens and Tabebuia serratifolia regarding different gap sizes, had been evaluated in Moju - Pará - Brazil(2°07'30''S and 2°12'06''S and longitude 48°46'57''W and 48°48'30''W). Nine gaps from forest harvesting had been selected and grouped in small gaps(200m2≤Área<400m2), medium-sized gaps(400m2≤Área<600m2) and large gaps(Área≥600m2). Around the gaps square plots 5m side had been installed, starting in the gap border to forest inside, according to North, South, East and West directions. In these plots seedlings from natural regeneration of tree species were planted. In the each gap center was installed a square plot of 5m side as testimony, where the plantation was repeated. The total mortality average was 46.9%, not showing significant differences between the small gaps (41,05%) and medium-sized gaps (43,86%) but these had differed from the large gaps (54,96%). The small gaps environment was most favorable for the establishment of most species, except for J. copaia and N. suaveolens whose mortalities had been lesser in the medium-sized gaps, even so has not had significant differences in mortality between the different gap sizes. Mortality varied from 14,5%(S. pruriens) in the small gaps to 70,1%(V. americana) in large gaps, but S. pruriens showed lesser mortality in all sizes of gap. All species had shown greater mortality in large gaps, with remark for V. americana (70,1%), J. copaia (69,1%) and N. suaveolens (58,7%). The mortality are between those finding in literature and for its variability they allow to conclude that if it cannot classify accurately the species in ecological groups only on mortality or survival basis. In terms of growth, however, the results are more conclusive, with evident indication of the medium-sized gaps as the best sites for development of the species, with average height growth of 15cm and base diameter growth 0,16cm, followed for the large gaps and for small ones. In general terms, the height growth average was 11,34cm and the base diameter ones was 0,11cm, with maximum values of 32,5cm (height) and 0,24cm (diameter of base) for J. copaia. P. paraensis and V. americana only had not presented significant differences in height growth regarding to different gap sizes, but the values had been a little bigger in the medium-sized gaps. The species growth and mortality, in two years of monitoring, had presented variations in relation to the different gap sizes. J. copaia and N. suaveolens had presented performance better, as much in terms of mortality as of growth in height and diameter of base in the medium-sized gaps, however this mortality was high in comparison with S. pruriens. It must, therefore, be care when taking silvicultural decisions like as thinning, because it was verified differences even though between species considered of the same ecological group.

AB  - The soil seed bank was studied in a seasonal semideciduous forest, in the domain of the Atlantic Forest, Southeastern Brazil (20°45 Latitude South, 42°55 Longitude West and altitude of 689.7 m). A total of 120 soil samples (20 x 15 cm and depth of 5 cm), without the litter layer, were taken at the end of the rainy season in ten sites differing in slope, aspect and topographic position. The soil samples were placed to germinate in trays under 11.5 and 60% shade. The germinated seeds were classified as graminoids, herbaceous-lianas, shrub and arboreal groups. A total of 3,416 seeds germinated, being 30.2% of graminoids, 29.2% herbaceous-lianas, 17.5% shrub and 23.1% arboreal individuals. The shrub-arboreal individuals were distributed into 17 families, 25 genus and 31 species. Melastomataceae, Cecropiaceae and Piperaceae accounted for 31.8%, 10.0% and 8.8%, respectively, of the total shrub-arboreal species germinated seeds, being Miconia cinnamomifolia and Leandra purpurascens the predominant species (59.3% of the total germinated seeds). Pioneer species accounted for 61.3% of the shrub-arboreal species and 88.5% of the germinated seeds. There were no late secondary species. The average number of germinated seeds from all life habit and sites studied accounted for 949 seeds/m2. The number of shrubarboreal species and germinated seeds differed significantly by the Kruskal-Wallis test (P ≤ 0.05) between sites. The dominance of pioneer species in the soil seed bank of the studied forest indicates that the buried seeds can be considered satisfactory for natural regeneration in treefall gaps and clearcut areas. Therefore, in order to maintain a continuous forest succession, when there is predominance of initial and late secondary species, the soil seed bank is not satisfactory. In this situation, the management of the seedlings stock is required to sustain the natural regeneration.

AB  - Several factors, including the site where the colony was established and number of active nests can influence directly or indirectly the breeding success of colonial birds. The red-rumped cacique, Cacicus haemorrhous (Linnaeus, 1766), is a passerine (Icteridae) that breeds in colonies in different environments. The objective of this study was to evaluate the breeding success of red-rumped cacique in relation to three environments (lake edge, forest and swamp) in which colonies were established in an Atlantic Forest reserve in southeast Brazil. Seven colonies from the three environments were monitored during the breeding season of 2001. Overall probability of nest survival was 40.5%. We found that colonies established in the swamp presented higher nest survival than the others and the ones in the lake edge had lower survival. Nest predation was the most important cause of nest failure, representing 46.5% of all nest losses. Other failure causes were abandonment and fall of nests, representing 6.6% and 6.1% of the losses, respectively. Red-rumped cacique had higher success breeding in colonies located in the swamp.

AB  - Brazil's BR-319 Highway linked Manaus, in the state of Amazonas, to Porto Velho, Rondônia, until it became impassable in 1988. Now it is proposed for reconstruction and paving, which would facilitate migration from the "Arc of Deforestation" in the southern part of the Amazon region to new frontiers farther north. The purpose of the highway, which is to facilitate transport to São Paulo of products from factories in the Manaus Free Trade Zone, would be better served by sending the containers by ship to the port of Santos. The lack of a land connection to Manaus currently represents a significant barrier to migration to central and northern Amazonia. Discourse regarding the highway systematically overestimates the highway's benefits and underestimates its impacts. A variety of changes would be needed prior to paving the highway if these potential impacts are to be attenuated. These include zoning, reserve creation, and increased governance in various forms, including deforestation licensing and control programs. More fundamental changes are also needed, especially the abandonment of the long-standing tradition in Brazil of granting squatters' rights to those who invade public land. Organizing Amazonian occupation in such a way that road construction and improvement cease to lead to explosive and uncontrolled deforestation should be a prerequisite for approval of the BR-319 and other road projects for which major impacts are expected. These projects could provide the impetus that is needed to achieve the transition away from appropriation of public land by both small squatters and by grileiros (large-scale illegal claimants). A delay in reconstructing the highway is advisable until appropriate changes can be effected. © 2006 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.

AB  - The central focus of this study is to characterize and compare the livelihood strategies of two coastal communities from the estuarine region of Ribeira Valley (São Paulo State, Southeastern Brazil), analyzing the interplay among four economic activities: small-scale agriculture, fishing, tourism-related jobs, and extraction of non-timber vegetal resources. The local people of these communities are mostly Caiçara, the native inhabitants of southeastern Brazilian coast, in an Atlantic forest area. The miscegenation of Amerindians, European colonizers, and African Brazilians gave rise to the Caiçara people, whose subsistence was originally based on small-scale itinerant agriculture, small-scale fishery, and some extraction of forest products. Their livelihoods activities changed through time: agricultural practices were gradually abandoned, while fishing grew in importance. Recently, tourism-related jobs and the extraction of non-timber vegetal resources acquired a key role in the estuarine Caiçara livelihood. After an historical overview, we focus our analysis on the local factors and external pressures affecting the combination of these activities.

AB  - The ability to map and monitor leaf area index throughout the Amazon Basin is important to assess and predict environmental degradation. This study measured leaf area index (LAI) values at 64 locations characteristic of many different cover types including mature forest, secondary succession, pasture, cropped land, barren land, and urban area throughout the Santarem, Brazil area. The field data were used in conjunction with ASTER visible and infrared data to compare the accuracy of multiple regression and artificial neural network models for LAI prediction. Assessments of model accuracy were determined by calculating RMSE. Results indicate that artificial neural networks are more accurate than traditional statistical techniques to estimate LAI in this part of the Amazon Basin. In addition, it was found that lower LAI values modeled the poorest because of a mix of spectral signature. Copyright © 2007 by V.H. Winston & Son, Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - A new Sciophilinae - Azana atlantica, sp.n.-is described from the Atlantic Forest in southeastern Brazil. The species has a number of distinctive apomorphic features, including loss of the mid ocellus, reduced mouthparts, Sc short and incomplete, first section of Rs missing, r-m elongated, longitudinal in position, aligned with the second section of Rs (R5), unforked medial and cubital veins, R4 missing, M4 entirely absent, gonostyle triangular, with an inner row of elongated spines and a basal, digitiform inner projection. Some of these features are shared with other genera of the Azana-group of Sciophilinae. The shape of the scutum and the strong spines on the gonostyle make it clear that the species belongs in Azana, despite the features that are distinctive from the remaining species in the genus. There are ten species described in Azana to date, from United States, Europe, Sri Lanka, Canary Islands, tropical Africa and Baltic amber. This is the first Neotropical species belonging to the genus. The complete loss of M4 and the separated gonocoxites suggest that Azana atlantica, sp.n. forms a monophyletic group with the Afrotropical species of the genus. Azana, Morganiella, Neoaphelomera, Neotrizygia, and Trizygia are shown to compose a small clade within the Azana-group of genera. The division of the genus into two subgenera - A. (Azana) and A. (Jugazana) - most probably renders A. (Azana) paraphyletic and it is suggested that this should be for the time being abandoned. Copyright © 2008 Magnolia Press.

AB  - Some seeds rely on fleshy lipid-rich appendages as attractants to ants. By carrying those seeds to their nest, ants play a major role as seed dispersers and can provide suitable conditions for seed germination. Ricinus communis (the commonly known castor) seeds are primarily dispersed by autochory but probably present secondary dispersal by ants, once they bear a lipid-rich elaiosome. The following questions were addressed: (1) are ants legitimate dispersers of castor seeds?; (2) which ant species interact with the seeds?; and (3) is germination success higher in a predicted scenario met by seeds discarded from ant nest? We compared the removal of seeds with and without elaiosome and we determined which ant species interact with castor seeds and whether there was seed predation by ants. We performed experiments under controlled conditions to evaluate seed germination responses to light, temperature and elaiosome. Seeds with elaiosome were removed preferentially and no predation was found, indicating that ants are legitimate seed dispersers. A large coterie of ants (20 species) interacts with castor seeds, especially Myrmicinae species. Elaiosome removal enhanced germination success, as well as alternated temperatures and absence of light. Such conditions are a mixture of two of the three scenarios we assumed for castor seed germination, and are met by seeds discarded from ant nest, but covered by a thin layer of litter, or eventually abandoned inside the nest, but in shallow depths. Therefore, by discarding seeds without elaiosome on the pile mound, ants may submit castor seeds to conditions that enhance germination.

AB  - Deforestation and habitat loss are widely expected to precipitate an extinction crisis among tropical forest species. Humans cause deforestation, and humans living in rural settings have the greatest impact on extant forest area in the tropics. Current human demographic trends, including slowing population growth and intense urbanization, give reason to hope that deforestation will slow, natural forest regeneration through secondary succession will accelerate, and the widely anticipated mass extinction of tropical forest species will be avoided. Here, we show that the proportion of potential forest cover remaining is closely correlated with human population density among countries, in both the tropics and the temperate zone. We use United Nations population projections and continent-specific relationships between both total and rural population density and forest remaining today to project future tropical forest cover. Our projections suggest that deforestation rates will decrease as population growth slows, and that a much larger area will continue to be forested than previous studies suggest. Tropical forests retracted to smaller areas during repeated Pleistocene glacial events in Africa and more recently in selected areas that supported large prehistoric human populations. Despite many caveats, these projections and observations provide hope that many tropical forest species will be able to survive the current wave of deforestation and human population growth. A strategy to preserve tropical biodiversity might include policies to improve conditions in tropical urban settings to hasten urbanization and preemptive conservation efforts in countries with large areas of extant forest and large projected rates of future human population growth. We hope that this first attempt inspires others to produce better models of future tropical forest cover and associated policy recommendations. © 2006 by The Association for Tropical Biology and Conservation.

AB  - The Atlantic forests of southern Bahia in Brazil present great species richness and a high degree of endemism. A large part of these native forests were transformed into cacao plantations in an agroforestry system known locally as cabrucas, where native trees were culled and cacao was planted under the shade of remaining trees. The present study analyzed the influence of time of implantation (age) and time of abandonment of management practices on tree species diversity of cabruca plantations to evaluate the capacity for conservation and recovery of species richness of native Atlantic Forest trees in cabrucas. Phytosociological surveys were conducted in five cabrucas with different conditions of age and state of abandonment. All trees, including hemiepiphytes and excluding the cacao plants, with a minimum stem diameter of 10 cm at breast height, were surveyed within a 3-ha sampling area in each plantation. A total of 2514 individual trees belonging to 293 species and 52 families were recorded in the five cabrucas. The Shannon diversity index varied from 3.31 to 4.22 among the cabrucas and was positively correlated with the time of abandonment (r = 0.97). The new cabrucas showed the highest values of estimated total richness (Chao) and the highest proportion of late successional species than the old ones. All areas preserved a very high proportion of native forest species while the three old cabrucas showed a higher proportion of exotic species than the two new ones. Thus the exotic species seem to replace more of the native species in the long run because of management practices and local preferences. The cabrucas presented also a high capacity for the regeneration of tree species richness after abandonment. Simple alterations in management practices could improve the recruitment of late successional species in these areas. Economic incentives may be necessary for the farmers to adopt management practices to retain native species which bring no economic returns. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.

AB  - The Capetinga gallery forest is located at Agua Limpa Farm, in the Federal District, Brazil. The floristic composition and structure of the natural regeneration at the edges and in the interior of the gallery forest at the watershed of the Capetinga stream was studied to detect floristic and structural patterns related to the forest environments. Thirty (5x5m) plots were placed in each environment to sample saplings, individuals from 1,0m high with diameter at the steam base under 5,0cm. Within these plots, (2x2m) sub-plots were allocated to sample seedlings, individuals lower than 1,0m height. The sampled plots were distant to the stream bank to minimize the humidity effect. Shannon & Wiener diversity index varied from 2,86 (seedlings at the edges) to 3,51 (saplings at the interior) and it was higher in the interior for both categories. Sørensen's similarity index varied from 0.474 for seedlings (comparing edges with interior) to 0.735 (seedlings and saplings at the edges). Czekanowski indices were low and reflected the high differentiation in structure from plot to plot in the same gallery forest. TWINSPAN classification suggested two distinct communities for saplings for both conditions, formed by species accordingly to their requirements for light and water. No differentiation was detected for seedlings between the environments indicating a low response of plants at an early stage to the environmental conditions within the forest. The Capetinga gallery forest suffered disturbances by fire and the small variations in species composition and vegetation structure between environments suggests that most of the natural regeneration is tolerant to light.

AB  - Microbiological soil-quality indicators, especially related to C and N cycles, and microbial diversity may be useful tools to determine whether a particular environment responds to an imposed management or reclamation strategy. External influences such as forest clearance and soil management affect biological indicators making them useful to point out whether the land use strategy is sustainable. Accordingly, the aim of this work was to assess the utility of some soil chemical and microbiological properties and 16S rDNA diversity in bacteria domain and their significance as soil-quality indicators in different land use systems in southern Brazil, Paraná State. Nine sites with soil originated from basalt (Rhodic Ferralsol), previously covered with the Atlantic native forest were evaluated: a native forest tract as reference; three sites artificially reforested with native species, but with understory differently managed; secondary forest naturally regenerated from abandoned pasture; artificially reforested with eucalyptus; two wheat-cropped sites at differing vegetative stages; one site in fallow. Twenty-four chemical and microbiological properties and their derivatives were assessed, in addition to molecular diversity of bacteria domain based on denaturating gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) analysis. Amongst all variables, the most dissimilar along the sites were total organic C, microbial biomass C and N, and ammonification rate. Total organic C was highest in the native forest, followed by secondary forest, eucalyptus and the artificially reforested sites; the wheat-cropped and fallow sites produced the lowest values. This trend was also observed for ammonification rate, which was closely correlated to organic C. Microbial biomass C and N were also higher in the reforested sites, whereas for microbial N biomass, the eucalyptus site resembled to the wheat-cropped and fallow sites. The DGGE analysis revealed that the fallow, eucalyptus and wheat-cropped sites had less bacterial diversity. All the sites reforested with native species grouped with the native forest, while the eucalyptus, fallow and wheat-cropped sites formed separate clusters. A similar clustering pattern was observed when all chemical and microbiological properties were considered in a grouping analysis. The results for reforestation employing native species tended to be similar to those of the stable native forest, while the use of an exotic species (eucalyptus) tended to be similar to those of the cropped sites. In addition, the fallow site showed general unfavorable trends in microbiological indicators and less bacterial diversity, suggesting that such soil management is not sustainable at least in subtropical areas. In this case, would be preferable provide the soil with vegetal covering that increase the organic C inputs and consequently microbial diversity and activity. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The anthropic exploration of native areas and the introduction of exotic species resulted in the process of biological contamination, responsible for environmental and economical damages. Biological invasions are considered the second worst threat to biodiversity. This work had the objective of identifying the infestation index of the invader exotic species Tecoma stans. It is aggressive and hard to control and spreads easily by winged seeds and vegetative structures. The work was carried out in the county of Bandeirantes - PR, and the T. stans infestations patches were identified by GPS after field visits. The informations were processed in the Georeferenced Information Processing System - SPRING 4.1. There were identified 72 patches, predominantly in the pastures areas, river adjacent forests and forest fragments borders. Among the 16 microbasins of the county, infestation patches were identified in 10. There were 20, 17, 11, 7 and 7 patches with higher incidence, in Água do Cateto, Água da CabiÚna, Ribeirão dos Índios, Água das Perobas and Água das Antas, respectively. The analysis of spatial distribution revealed that the patches present the tendency to group up to 2.000 m away. The actual situation found in the analyzed areas is concerning, due to the high levels of T. stans infestations. The species is present in many of the neglect areas and puts in risk the forest remainders close to these areas.

AB  - The gallery forest along the stream in the Cerrado region of Brazil is the most rich and diverse community of the biome, mainly due to remarkable variations on their physical environment. The Pitoco gallery forest is located at the IBGE Ecological Reserve, in the Federal District, Brazil, and had its tree regeneration evaluated six years after an accidental fire. For this purpose 100 plots were placed in contiguous transects from the stream right margin to the forest-savanna boundary. Within these plots, 5×5m2 sub-plots were allocated to sample saplings, 1,0m or higher individuals showing basal diameter, Db 30cm≥5cm. Within the lasts there were placed 2×2m2 sub-plots to sample seedlings, individuals lower than 1m height. The assessment was based on comparisons among saplings, seedlings and trees floristic composition and phytossociology. Trees were assessed before the 1994 fire. In the total 118 species of 47 families were found, among which 77 seedling species of 38 families and 111 sapling species of 45 families. The most important (DR+FR) seedling species were: Symplocos mosenii, Inga alba, Alibertia macrophylla, Myrcia rostrata, Copaifera langsdorffii, Xilopia sericea, Cardiopetalum calophyllum, Maprounea guianensis, Pera glabrata and Vitexpolygama. Among saplings the most important (IVI) were Siparuna guianensis, Matayba guianensis, Symplocos mosenii, Cupania vernalis, Cheiloclinium cognatum, Myrcia rostrata, C. langsdorffii, I. alba, Tapura amazonica and Pseudolmedia laevigata. The Shannon & Wiener diversity index were 3,22 (seedlings) and 3,93 (saplings). There were considerable floristic differences among seedlings saplings and trees layers. The reduced representation of tolerant species and increased representation of light demanding species after the fire suggests changes in the light balance within the gallery forest.

AB  - The objective of this paper is to evaluate the interaction between backscatter (σ°) from Polarimetric L-band SAR data (collected by the airborne sensor R99-B/SIPAM) and biophysical parameters of the primary forest and secondary succession sites. The area under study is located in the region of Tapajós (Brazil), where SAR data were collected in May 2005. Another approach under investigation is the evaluation of the contribution from basic backscatter mechanisms, using the Freeman-Durden decomposition technique, applied to complex SAR images, where the physiognomic-structural characteristics of the forest stands give a significant contribution. In brief, it was possible to verify that the variable "tree height" has better relations with the backscatter values, when compared to other biophysical variables, especially when the model also includes variations of the incidence angle of the stripes imaged. The decomposition technique showed that the volumetric scattering component has the strongest influence on the SAR response at primary and secondary tropical forests. © 2007 IEEE.

AB  - Provisioning weaned young is an important part of the cooperative rearing system of marmosets and tamarins (family: Callitrichidae). Juvenile callitrichids receive a substantial proportion of their diet from all adult group members, whereas juveniles of most other primate species only receive food from the mother infrequently via scrounging. We conducted a longitudinal study of provisioning to 21 young wild golden lion tamarins through their first year of life in two Brazilian reserves. Juveniles were predicted to experience higher provisioning rates at the site with mature forest (the presumed ancestral habitat) and in territories that contained a higher proportion of preferred habitat within the mature forest reserve. Key measures of provisioning did not differ substantially between habitat types. The rates at which juveniles begged for food were very similar across habitats, while the influence of habitat on the rates at which juveniles received food was small and varied across age groups. The most pronounced differences between the reserves were: adult resistance to food-transfer attempts was less frequent, food-offering calls before food transfer were more frequent, and the proportion of prey provisioned was higher in the reserve in which earlier successional-stage forest predominated. Within the mature forest reserve, begging success of young juveniles covaried positively with preferred habitat. Rather than overt caretaker-offspring conflict, an information-feedback loop between juveniles and adults appears to drive provisioning changes as juveniles mature. Direct measures of resource abundance are needed to help clarify the mechanisms by which forest successional stage influences provisioning. © Springer-Verlag 2006.

AB  - We evaluated floristic and ecological changes in plant communities after disturbance in Southern Atlantic Rain Forests, in the Brazilian states of Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo, Paraná and Santa Catarina. We compiled data for 410 tree species from 18 forests ranging from 4 to 120 years after disturbance, and classified them by dispersal mode (animal vs. non-animal), successional group (pioneer vs. non-pioneer), vertical position (understorey vs. non-understorey) and geographic distribution (Atlantic Forest vs. widespread). We found that both geographical location and time since disturbance affect species distribution and β-diversity. Regression analyses showed significant, positive and strong relations (0.26 ≤ r2 ≤ 0.63; P < 0.05) between fragment age and species richness, proportion of animal dispersed species, of non-pioneer species, of understorey species and with restricted distribution. Applying our data to values found in literature we predict that a forest needs about one to three hundred years to reach the proportion of animal-dispersed species (80% of the species), the proportion of non-pioneer species (90%) and of understorey species (50%) found in mature forests. On the other hand much more time is necessary (between one and four thousand years) to reach the endemism levels (40% of the species) that exist in mature forests. Our findings indicate that disturbance results in significant changes in species composition (decrease in endemic species) and ecological guilds (decrease in zoochory and in non-pioneer and understorey species), but forests can gradually recover over time spans of hundreds of years. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Aiming to provide primary data to be used in restoration programs, data from a floristic and phytosociological survey at a Submontane Ombrophilous Dense Forest remnant around São Bento river dam (Siderópolis municipality, Santa Catarina State, southern Brazil) are presented. All tree individuals with a diameter at breast height (DBH) ≥ 5 cm were recorded (1 ha plot). 1,715 individuals belonging to 107 species and 42 botanical families were identified. Euterpe edulis Mart., Casearia sylvestris Sw. and Bathysa australis (St.-Hil.) K.Schum. were the species with higher values of structural importance. High index of zoophily and zoochory were registered among the identified species. From the floristic composition and litter abundance, it can be assumed that the studied area corresponds to an advanced stage of natural regeneration.

AB  - Marajó Island shows an abundance of paleochannels easily mapped in its eastern portion, where vegetation consists mostly of savannas. SRTM data make possible to recognize paleochannels also in western Marajó, even considering the dense forest cover. A well preserved paleodrainage network from the adjacency of the town of Breves (southwestern. Marajó Island) was investigated in this work combining remote sensing and sedimentological studies. The palimpsest drainage system consists of a large meander connected to narrower tributaries. Sedimentological studies revealed mostly sharp-based, fining upward sands for the channelized features, and interbedded muds and sands for floodplain areas. The sedimentary structures and facies successions are in perfect agreement with deposition in channelized and floodplain environments, as suggested by remote sensing mapping. The present study shows that this paleodrainage was abandoned during Late Pleistocene, slightly earlier than the Holocene paleochannel systems from the east part of the island. Integration of previous studies with the data available herein supports a tectonic origin, related to the opening of the Pará River along fault lineaments. This would explain the disappearance of large, north to northeastward migrating channel systems in southwestern Marajó Island, which were replaced by the much narrower, south to southeastward flowing modern channels.

AB  - Understory bird communities have been studied in a series of Amazonian rainforest fragments near Manaus, Brazil for about 20 years. Previous analysis of standardized mist-net samples revealed considerable temporal dynamism in capture rates, with communities in fragments responding to growth or cutting of the second growth matrix. This pattern was superimposed on expected fragment size effects among the 1-, 10-, and 100-ha fragments. Here we extend our earlier analysis of landscape effects by separately considering 1- and 10-ha fragments, with the goal of describing the recovery of bird communities in fragments surrounded by abandoned second growth. Most guilds, with the exception of terrestrial insectivores, appear to be on a trajectory to return to pre-isolation abundance in 10-ha fragments within about 40 years. Although some guilds showed similar recovery in 1-ha fragments, these were mostly species also common in second growth. Our results suggest that matrix development can allow bird communities to approach pre-isolation structure in fragments of at least 10 ha, but we emphasize that this conclusion represents a best-case scenario facilitated by the proximity to primary forest of the fragments we studied.

AB  - This work aimed to describe physiognomy and structure of a Dense Ombrophyllous Forest fragment located in Catende, Pernambuco. All trees with DAP (breast height diameter) ≥ 4.77 cm were measured in 40 10 x 25 m plots, systematically installed in five transects. A total of 1049 individuals were observed, distributed in 91 species, 64 genera and 37 botanical families. Mimosaceae and Lauraceae were the families with higher species number, while Anacardiaceae and Moraceae had the highest individuals numbers. Shannon index (H′) was 3.83 nats/ind. Total basal area, height and diameter (average and maximum) were 23.59 m2/ha, 13.57 m (± 7.13), 45 m, 13.20 cm (± 10.60) and 127.32 cm, respectively. The species with higher importance values were Tapirira guianensis Aubl., Dialium guianense (Aubl.) Sandwith, Helicostylis tomentosa (Poepp. & Endl.) Rusby, Thyrsodium spruceanum Benth., Plathymenia foliolosa Benth., Brosimum discolor Schott, Parkia pendula (Willd.) Benth. ex Walp., Schefflera morototoni (Aubl.) Maguire, Steyerm. & Frodin, Eschweilera ovata (Cambess.) Miers and Cecropia palmata Willd. Diametric distribution had an inverted-J-like curve, predicted for a forest unequal in ages in a secondary succession stage.

AB  - Spanish cedar (Cedrela odorata L.) and Yellow poui (Tabebuia serratifolia Nichols.) are economically valuable tropical tree species that have been threatened by predatory logging and by forest fragmentation. Their seeds are wind-dispersed and both the species colonize and grow-up in pastures. This study compared the genetic diversity in a pasture-established population to a forest population. Thirty yellow poui trees were genotyped with five isozyme loci and fifty four spanish cedar trees were genotyped with four microsatellite loci. Genetic diversity was high in both the populations. In yellow poui, genetic diversity was higher in the pasture population. It was observed loss of alleles in cedar pasture population (Â = 11,75 alleles/locus) in relation to the forest population (Â = 14,50).Moreover, 31% of the cedar alleles were private to the forest population. Genetic divergence was null in yellow poui populations, but significant in the cedar ones (2,2%). Pasture populations don't show evidence of severe genetic bottleneck for both the species. Colonization of anthropogenic areas by these species was efficient, but it requires continuous gene flow, through successive generations, in order to restore (for spanish cedar) and maintain (for yellow poui) the levels of genetic diversity observed in the forest population.

AB  - The effect of the introduction of an agrosylvopasture (SASP) system on the changes in the carbon (C) of the soil and its lability were studied. Since 1993, this system has been annually implanted in Paracatu, MG. It was planted under eucalyptus forest abandoned after three cuts, when the brachiaria grass was established. The eucalyptususes were planted at 10 × 4 m spacing, and the following crops have been grown between the lines: rice in the first year, soybean in the second, and brachiaria in the third. After the third year, pasture of the meat cattle begins on brachiaria and remains until the end of the system cycle that was foreseen for the 11th year. A savannah area and another one with eucalyptusus under a conventional system were used as references to natural condition and the way the area is used before plantation of the SASP, respectively. Some samples aged 1, 2, 3, 6, and 10 years were collected in SASP. According to the obtained results, the following conclusions were drawn: (i) the C contents and stocks were affected before and during the plantation of the SASP by the use and management of SASP, as they were reduced in the first years of the system establishment but improved at the 10th year; (ii) the C from the particulate free light fraction (CFLLP) that was extracted by potassium permangate (KMnO4) was sensitive to the use and management, and so reflected the changes in total organic C (TOC); (iii) the more labile fractions of C that were extracted at different concentrations of sulfuric acid (H2SO4) satisfactorily reflected the changes in both use and management, whereas the less labile fractions were just slightly affected; and (iv) the C management index (IMC) calculated from CFLLP was the most sensitive to the changes in use and management. However, when calculated from the C fraction 1 extracted by 3M H2SO4 (CF1), it showed better reliability. Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The relationships among floristic, structural and physiognomic variables of the tree component, flooding regime variations and soil fertility were investigated in a riparian forest fragment (ca. 43 ha) in the Rio Botucaraí watershed near the confluence with the Rio Jacuí, southern Brazil. All the trees with a dbh ≥ 15 cm were surveyed in 100 contiguous 10 × 10 m plots and soil chemical and textural variables were obtained from the analyses of 15 topsoil samples (0-20 cm depth) collected at different locations. The sample sites encompass all the topographic variation of the area. We used canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) to seek correlations between environmental variables and tree component distribution. The 1,547 surveyed individuals belonged to 30 species and 16 botanical families. The Shannon diversity index (H′) and the Pielou equability (J′) were 1.995 and 0.586 nats ind.-1, respectively. Sebastiania commersoniana, Casearia sylvestris, Eugenia uniflora and Eugenia hyemalis presented the highest importance values. Species' densities chiefly correlated with site elevation, flooding regime and soil chemical fertility. The analyses of ecological categories (EC) revealed that most species are heliophylous and typical of early successional stages. Richness and diversity (P < 0.001) variations from different topographic positions reflect that at the local scale, flooding was a limiting factor for the establishment of certain species suggesting that local processes control species richness and diversity. © 2006 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - In this paper I examined the usefulness of tree population size distributions in evaluating the conservation status of populations of an endangered tree species. I set expectations derived from two complimentary views of the ecology of rainforest trees and examined whether they were met by size distributions of populations of the South American dominant conifer Araucaria angustifolia and its relationship with forest structural characteristics. Specifically, I evaluated the expectations that (i) A. angustifolia trees have larger diameter than average angiosperm trees and form a higher monospecific canopy layer above the shorter angiosperm canopies; (ii) A. angustifolia populations are characterized by size distributions with many large individuals and a long tail of relatively rare, small individuals (have symmetry coefficient <0); (iii) the symmetry of the size distribution of A. angustifolia populations is negatively related to the abundance of large (d.b.h. ≥ 10.0 cm) individuals in the population; and (iv) the abundance of A. angustifolia trees is negatively related to the abundance of angiosperm trees, as the successional accumulation of angiosperm stems would not be accompanied by the recruitment of new A. angustifolia. These expectations were evaluated using data on 25 populations of A. angustifolia sampled in the Rio Grande do Sul State in southern Brazil. The first, third and fourth expectations were met, while the second one was only partially met. This was because populations showed a bimodal distribution regarding symmetry in size distribution, with most populations showing normal or negative symmetry, and those logged, adult-depleted populations showing positive skewness. © 2007 Ecological Society of Australia.

AB  - Studies concerning the use of multiple natural resources by Amazonian indians are scarce. This work presents a portrait of how the Deni Indians, inhabitants of an area between two of the most important white-water rivers of the Amazon basin (Juruá and Purus Rivers), exploit natural resources in their territory. The Deni exploit both the upland and floodplain forests. They are a mix of horticulturalists and hunter-gatherers, using their whole territory to obtain what they need to live. As a rule, they move their settlements periodically, avoiding local resource depletion. The Deni modify the landscape at a local level, causing an increase in resource availability. Abandoned villages, fruit orchards and crops are places where floristic and faunistic resources concentrate and are systematically exploited. The impacts of such management are apparently minimal. For the Deni society natural resources are the only way to get goods for survival, but it is inserted in the periphery of a capitalist system which exploits and will continue to exploit natural resources in order to produce a surplus for the acquisition of industrialized products, independently of external judgements. This should be the starting point to evaluate sustainability in this local management system.

AB  - The goal of restoration is to accelerate ecosystem recovery, but in ecosystems that naturally regenerate rapidly restoration techniques need to be selected carefully to facilitate rather than impede natural recovery. We compared the effects of five restoration techniques, such as plowing the soil, removing grasses, adding forest litter, seeding, and planting nursery-growing seedlings, on the regeneration of seasonal deciduous forest trees in four abandoned pastures in central Brazil. We monitored all woody stems immediately prior to treatments and again 14 months after the treatments. We recorded an average of 16,663 tree stems per hectare and a total of 83 species before implementing treatments. Planting strongly increased species richness; adding litter and seeding had weaker positive effects on richness; and plowing and grass removal had no effect. Plowing substantially reduced the density of naturally established stems. Despite the high survival of planted seedlings, stem density in planting treatments did not change because the tractor and digging holes to plant seedlings caused mortality of naturally regenerating seedlings. Tree stems grew more in the grass release plots than in the control plots. Our results suggest that early succession of seasonal deciduous forest in pastures in the region studied does not need to be stimulated once the perturbation is stopped and that intensive restoration efforts may actually slow recovery. We recommend only enrichment planting of seedlings that are not able to resprout. © 2007 Society for Ecological Restoration International.

AB  - The increased forest cover loss in the tropical and subtropical regions has stimulated the development of restoration methods through tree plantations. Based on the successional model of forest development the use of different successional groups can be seen as a strategy to accelerate the re-composition of forests and an attempt to recover ecological conditions prior to disturbance. Tree species have particular growth rates and ecological needs, and this knowledge is important in the development of high diversity models of forest restoration. The objective of this study was to compare the initial growth and litterfall of native pioneer versus early secondary tree species in a mixed plantation system, and to determine the relationships between guilds and measurements. The comparison among species and guilds was made based on dendrometric and allometric parameters, and in terms of annual litterfall. The study was carried out in the Guarita Indian Area, Tenente Portela, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. Dendrometry of seven species was evaluated, including the pioneer tree species Mimosa scabrella Bentham, Trema micrantha (L.) Blume, Schinus molle L., Enterolobium contortisiliquum (Vell.) Morong, and the early secondary tree species Peltophorum dubium (Spreng.) Taub., Cedrela fissilis Vell. and Tabebuia alba (Cham.) Sandwith. The litterfall was quantified for the first six species. The pioneer tree species exhibited higher average height, stem diameter and crown width than the early secondary tree species. The pioneer species (except E. contortisiliquum) showed also higher values of average annual litterfall. A positive interspecific correlation between stem diameter and annual litterfall was observed. The data indicate that the choice of the species and guilds is significant to the quality of the restoration. Nevertheless, the aboveground architecture may depend on species-specific allometric characteristics and a distinction among guilds was not observed.

AB  - Phytosociological parameters, as the frequency of height and diameter classes, are commonly used to make inferences about secondary succession in given phytocenoses. Shrub and tree individuals higher than 1.5 m and with a bole length of at least 1.3 m were sampled in 2,600 m2 of semideciduous seasonal forest in the Municipal Botanical Garden of Bauru (JBMB). Information on the diameter class frequencies of five species with the highest Importance Value Index (Ocotea pulchella, Protium heptaphyllum, Copaifera langsdorffii, Platypodium elegans and Trichilia pallida) and the more numerous species' successional classification were analyzed to make inferences about the successional features of the studied community. The diameter class frequencies of savannic species Vochysia tucanorum were also studied. The information obtained allowed to consider that the forest of the JBMB is at an intermediate successional stage, and that, although it used to be periodically burnt, some of its populations are able to renew themselves.

AB  - The extent to which secondary forests occupying degraded and abandoned lands provide suitable habitat for forest-adapted species is an important conservation issue in times of vanishing old growth forests. We used ants (Hymenoptera: Formicidae), a functionally important and diverse group of invertebrates, to investigate the recovery of soil taxa during secondary forest succession in the Atlantic Forest of Southern Brazil. We compared the resilience of epigeic vs. hypogeic ant assemblages. For this purpose we established 27 sites that encompassed a chronosequence from pastures to old growth forests on two contrasting soil types. Our results are based on a collection of 35 508 individuals in 40 genera. Richness and composition of ant assemblages in secondary forests have recovered slowly and have not approached conditions typical of old growth forests. The distribution of genera along the successional stages was arranged in a nested pattern where ant genera of younger successional stages were a subset of genera present in older stages. Edaphic conditions had no influence on the recovery process. Overall, richness of ants was lower at study sites with water-logged soils than at sites where soils did not exhibit hydromorphic properties. The hypogeic ant assemblage recovered more slowly than the epigeic assemblage. Our results show that secondary forests do not act as refuges for many forest-adapted animals which are currently restricted to discontinuous patches of old growth forest in the highly endangered Atlantic Forest of Brazil. Moreover, estimated recovery times of 50 to several hundred years suggest it would take much longer than previously presumed for complete recolonization. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The present study aims to characterize the distribution of bromeliads height preference at four sucessional stages ("capoeirinha", "capoeira", "capoeirão" and secondary forest) on Atlantic Rainforest slopes, in Santa Catarina Island, relating them to forest development, individual and phorophytes characteristics. Importance values were calculated for each bromeliad, and their dispersal agent types and nutrient capture strategy were determined. Each of the 60 phorophytes selected through the point-centered quart method in each of the secondary succession stages was considered a sampling unit and divided in two-meter height intervals, starting from the soil. The species of Tillandsia with CAM activity presented the highest importance values in the two most developed succession stages, where bromeliads were recorded. In all stages of succession was detected, in the vertical stratification, a tendency of greater richness and frequency of bromeliads in heights next to morphological inversion point average, related to availability of larger surface area to colonization and growth. At capoeirão and secondary forest, juvenile bromeliads grew in all phorophytes height intervals, showing different mortality rates when adults and juveniles distribution were considered. The microclimatic changes in the progressive sucessional stages cause displacement and change of bromeliads species, with increase of individuals and tank-forming species.

AB  - Deforestation and conversion of forests to pasture is one of the most degrading activities impacting the Atlantic Rain Forest. We analyzed pastures abandoned for 8, 14, 48, 50 and 96 months in Antonina (Paraná state; 25°19′15″ S; 45°24′24″ W) to verify if herb cover reduces the natural regeneration of the Atlantic forest. We identified species and assessed shoot biomass of herbaceous species (in 24 1 m2 plots), and calculated the volume of all woody species (height ≥ 1m; in 24 25 m2 plots). We collected 59 herbaceous species (1,062 individuals) most of which were allochthonous species (95%), including Brachiaria decumbens and B. humidicola. We also sampled 104 woody species (2,234 individuals). There were significant floristic and structural changes in the community during the first four years since the pasture was abandoned. Woody vegetation development was negatively related to herb species' biomass, suggesting that grasses (B. decumbens) inhibited forest regeneration. Our results suggested that management, including Brachiaria spp removal, is necessary for the restoration of abandoned pastures in the Atlantic Forest region.

AB  - The organic matter dynamics in Atlantic forest ecosystems must be understood to ensure the efficiency of conservation programs. Chemical characteristics of humic substances are important because they reflect the soil genesis processes and soil management, and can be used as indicator of the organic matter quality. The purpose of this study was to test the organic matter quality as a marker of the soil environment in areas of native Atlantic forest developed on a distrophyc Gleysol and a distrophyc Cambisol and in abandoned plantations of eucalyptus of different ages, at the União Biological Reserve, RJ, Brazil The distribution of the humified fractions of the soil organic matter and humic acids were evaluated by chemical and spectroscopic methods, in two soil layers (0-0.10 and 0.10-0.20 m). Soil fortility of the Biological Reserve was very low, representing a limiting factor for the humification process. Humic substances represented less than 50 % of the oxidized carbon, indicating that most of the organic matter consists ofnon-humic substances. Consequently, forest litterfall plays a central role in the plant/microorganism nutrition. The relative distribution of the humic fraction was not altered by the plant cover or soil class. The chemical nature of the humic acids was similar to fulvic acids. These characteristics were expressed by a low carbon content, high H/C and O/C ratios and high acidity values which resulted in humified material with low chemical evolution. Infrared spectroscopy indicated the effect of the soil class and plant cover on the chemical quality of the humic acids. The fluorescence intensity of humified material isolated from the Atlantic forest area was high, suggesting higher lability and capacity to release electrons for chemical reactions in the soil.

AB  - The objective of this study was to analyze the composition and the dynamics of the natural regeneration of the Gama gallery forest at the Fazenda Água Limpa, in the Federal District, over a period of 13 years (1986-1999) and to detect patterns associated between edge and interior of the forest. A total of 151 plots of 10×20 m were allocated continually along ten lines, used for sampling the arboreal vegetation. Each (10×20 m) plot, contained sub-plots of 5×5 m (saplings) and of 2×2 m (seedlings) for sampling natural regeneration. Ten additional plots were sampled at the edge of the forest for comparison of the floristic diversity. The predominant families were practically the same for seedlings and saplings: Myrtaceae, Melastomastaceae, Proteaceae and Lauraceae. Metrodorea pubescens A. St.-Hil. & Tul. and Amaioua guianensis Aubl. were the species with greater relative density in both regeneration stages. The species in the plots at the edge were practically the same found in the interior of the forest except for some species like Bauhinia rufa and Campomanesia eugenioides. Two different communities composed by different species according to their water requirementes, were identified for plots at the forest edge and also for plots at the interior. The forest has not been suffering disturbances and the great majority of the species was present in both size categories and in similar levels of density with few exceptions, indicating stability in the floristic composition and structure over time, in spite of a reduction in density. © 2017, Sociedade Botanica do Brasil.

AB  - Assessing patterns of abundance and distribution of Amazonian species is still an overwhelming task that requires integration of multiple disciplines. This work is based on background information gathered from previous reconstructions of the geological history of the lower Amazon drainage basin, in order to analyse biodiversity patterns within the context of landscape transformation. A highly dynamic geological scenario is depicted for this area during the Plio-Pleistocene and Holocene, which consisted of a large palaeovalley formed as a response of tectonic reactivation. This palaeovalley was filled with sediments transported by a north/northwest orientated palaeo-Tocantins River. The palaeodrainage became abandoned as the main river course was deviated to the northeast, initiating the separation of Marajó Island from mainland. Geology had a direct impact on the modern physiognomy, with open vegetation dominating in areas with Holocene sedimentation, while closed forests prevailing in older Quaternary and, probably also, Pliocene terrains. Data from fossil and modern mammalian groups indicate the connection of Marajó Island to the mainland during the Last Glacial Maximum, when open vegetation seems to have dominated. Tectonic subsidence was responsible for the maintenance of this vegetation pattern on the eastern side of the Marajó Island, keeping it as a habitat favourable for savanna adapted faunal elements. Based on this kind of information, this work attempts to highlight the importance of integrating studies combining geological and biological events as the key to understand biodiversity patterns in Amazonia. It is expected to open new lines of research dealing with the comprehension of ecology, species and genetic diversity, biogeography, evolutionary scenarios, and speciation mechanisms. © 2006 The Authors.

AB  - The state of Rio Grande do Sul has, up to the present, records of 38 of the 168 bat species known to occur in Brazil, and several of its regions are severely understudied. In this study, a list of chiropteran species of the municipality of Frederico Westphalen, in the northernmost region of Rio Grande do Sul, is provided, as well as information on the use of human buildings and abandoned mines for seven of the 25 species recorded in the municipality. From October, 2004 to June, 2008, sampling was carried out in eleven areas of the municipality in order to survey the local chiropterofauna. The presence of species was recorded based on captures using mist nets, active searches in shelters, and specimens obtained from local residents. The recorded species belonged to 13 genera, of which 11 belonged to the family Vespertilionidae, whereas the families Molossidae and Phyllostomidae were represented by seven species each. The results obtained in the present study place the Upper Uruguay among the regions of highest species richness in Rio Grande do Sul.

AB  - Changes in the forest structure were analyzed considering two harvest intensities in 108ha of primary forest in the Rio Capim Forest Management Unit, belonging to Cikel Brasil Verde Madeiras Ltda., in the municipality of Paragominas, Pará. Data were collected in 2003 (before harvesting) and 2004 (after harvesting) in 36 0.25ha permanent sample plots, randomly distributed in the area (12 in unlogged forest, 12 in logged forest and 12 in logged forest plus extraction of coarse woody debris). Before logging (2003), 4469 trees with DBH ≥ 10cm were recorded in the 36 plots (9ha sample). Seven months after logging (2004), the number of trees increased to 4531 but only 4330 were found alive. Lecythis idatimon, Poecilanthe effusa, Rinorea flavescens, Eschweilera grandiflora, Eschweilera pedicellata, Inga sp., Protium spp., Vouacapoua americana, Guatteria poeppigiana and Eschweilera coriacea were the ten most important species both before and after logging. Forest structure, in the two harvest intensities, had significant changes due to the logging. But there were no significant changes between the two logged areas, suggesting that the extraction of the coarse woody debris after logging did not cause significant damage to the remaining forest. Forest structure changed slightly after logging but these changes were not significant among the three communities. Despite the reduction in adult tree stock of commercial species due to logging and coarse woody debris extraction, the stand kept characteristics similar to the original forest. Studies on natural regeneration (DBH ≤ 10cm), pos-harvesting silviculture and growth of the forest are recommended.

AB  - There has been growing concern about land use/land cover change in tropical regions, as there is evidence of its influence on the observed increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration and consequent climatic changes. Mapping of deforestation by the Brazil's National Space Research Institute (INPE) in areas of primary tropical forest using satellite data indicates a value of 587,727 km2 up to the year 2000. Although most of the efforts have been concentrated in mapping primary tropical forest deforestation, there is also evidence of large-scale deforestation in the cerrado savanna, the second most important biome in the region. The main purpose of this work was to assess the extent of agriculture/pasture and secondary succession forest in the Brazilian Legal Amazon (BLA) in 2000, using a set of multitemporal images from the 1-km SPOT-4 VEGETATION (VGT) sensor. Additionally, we discriminated primary tropical forest, cerrado savanna, and natural/artificial waterbodies. Four classification algorithms were tested: quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA), simple classification trees (SCT), probability-bagging classification trees (PBCT), and k-nearest neighbors (K-NN). The agriculture/pasture class is a surrogate for those areas cleared of its original vegetation cover in the past, acting as a source of carbon. On the contrary, the secondary succession forest class behaves as a sink of carbon. We used a time series of 12 monthly composite images of the year 2000, derived from the SPOT-4 VGT sensor. A set of 19 Landsat scenes was used to select training and testing data. A 10-fold cross validation procedure rated PBCT as the best classification algorithm, with an overall sample accuracy of 0.92. High omission and commission errors occurred in the secondary succession forest class, due to confusion with agriculture/pasture and primary tropical forest classes. However, the PBCT algorithm generated the lower misclassification error in this class. Besides, this algorithm yields information about class membership probability, with ∼80% of the pixels with class membership probability greater or equal than 0.8. The estimated total area of agriculture/pasture and secondary succession forest in 2000 in the BLA was 966 × 103 and 140 × 10 3 km2, respectively. Comparison with an existing land cover map indicates that agriculture/pasture occurred primarily in areas previously occupied by primary tropical forest (46%) and cerrado savanna (33%), and also in transition forest (19%), and other vegetation types (2%). This further confirms the existing evidence of extensive cerrado savanna conversion. This study also concludes that SPOT-4 VGT data are adequate for discriminating several major land cover types in tropical regions. Agriculture/pasture was mapped with errors of about 5%. Very high classification errors were associated with secondary succession forest, suggesting that a different methodology/sensor has to be used to address this difficult land cover class (namely with the inclusion of ancillary data). For the other classes, we consider that accurate maps can be derived from SPOT-4 VGT data with errors lower than 20% for the cerrado savanna, and errors lower than 10% for the other land cover classes. These estimates may be useful to evaluate impacts of land use/land cover change on the carbon and water cycles, biotic diversity, and soil degradation. © 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - The phytosociology of the woody stratum of both young regenerating individuals and seed banks are quality indicators of heterogeneous reforestations. The objetive of this research was to evaluate the structure of regeneration of the arboreal species in two natural remainders, in three areas reforested with native species and in a Eucalyptus robusta settlement located in a floodplain of Mogi-Guaçu river in Luiz Antônio County (21° 31'S and 47° 55'W), São Paulo, Brazil. Sampling was collected in 40 subplots of 2 m2in of each natural remainder and each eucalyptus sub-forest, as well as 60 subplots of 3.5 m2in each area reforested. All individuals with height ≥10 cm and diameter at breast height (DBH) << 5.0 cm were measured and analyzed separately in four height classes according to floristic diversity, similarity, density, frequency, dominance, importance value and natural regeneration. A total of 2,010 individuals were identified, belonging to 24 families, 46 genera and 51 species. The species with greater importance values were Cabralea canjerana, Psidium cattleyanum, Nectandra megapotamica, Acacia polyphylla and Syzygium cumini, well represented in the four height classes. Reforestation with native species in a degraded Mogi-Guaçu River floodplain promoted natural regeneration with more biodiversity than in natural remainders submitted to border effect, and contributed to the forest ecosystem restoration process. The 20-year-old Eucalyptus robusta plantation promoted the regeneration of climax and secondary species.

AB  - Sorocea bonplandii is a pharmacologically interesting tree characteristic of the sub-canopy stratus of the Atlantic Forest. In 13 forest remnants in the Alto Uruguai River region, individuals of this species with DBH ≥5 cm have been evaluated using the point-centered quarter method. In five of the remnants, all individuals of the species have been analysed using the permanent sample plots method. The parameters analysed were plants ha -1, DBH, total height, and height at first bifurcation. Absolut diameter varied from 15 to 148 S. bonplandii plants ha -1 (DBH ≥5 cm), corresponding to approximately 10% of all woody plants. When all plants independent of DBH were examined, 1834-6074 plants ha -1 were found. While the absolute number of plants ha -1 exhibited a great variation, the relative distribution of height classes was similar in all remnants, indicating typical seedling bank behaviour. S. bonplandii exhibited a characteristic clumped spatial distribution based on Morisita index. The current work is part of a larger study of the ecologically and economically important Subtropical Atlantic Forest in Southern Brazil. The only way to protect the last remainders of this ecosystem is to define knowledge-based ways of sustainable uses. S. bonplandii clearly is one of the most promising candidates for phytopharmocological, non-timber uses of Subtropical Atlantic Forest plants.

AB  - The objective of this work was to select indigenous vegetal species for restoration programs aiming at the regeneration of ombrophilous dense forest. Thirty-five spoil piles located in the county of Sideropolis, Santa Catarina, that received overburden disposal for 39 years (1950-1989) were selected for study because they exhibited remarkable spontaneous regrowth of trees compared to surrounding spoil piles. Floristic inventory covered the whole area of the 35 piles, whereas survey on phytosociology and natural regeneration studies were conducted in 70 plots distributed along the 35 piles. Floristic inventory recorded 83 species from 28 botanical families. Herbaceous terricolous plants constituted the predominant species (47.0%), followed by shrubs (26.5%), trees (19.3%), and vines (7.2%). Results from surveys on phytosociology and natural regeneration, focused on shrubs and trees, recorded incipient ecological succession. In addition, the most adapted species recorded on the overburden piles, as ranked by index of natural regeneration (RNT) plus importance value index (IVI), were as follows: Clethra scabra (RNT = 23.93%; IVI = 17.28%), Myrsine coriacea (RNT =20.93%, IVI = 11.26%), Eupatorium intermedium (RNT = 7.56%, IVI = 0.40%), Miconia ligustroides (RNT = 5.84%, IVI = 2.37%), Ossaea amygdaloides (RNT = 3.84%, IVI = 1.30%), Tibouchina sellowiana (RNT = 3.29%, IVI = 1.94%), Eup. inulaefolium (RNT = 2.65%, IVI = 0.80%), and Baccharis dracunculifolia (RNT = 2.28%; IVI = 0.56%). High values of IVI and RNT exhibited by the exotic species Eucalyptus saligna (IVI = 21.73%, RNT = 51.41%) indicated strong competition between exotic and indigenous species. Severe chemical (acidic pH and lack of nutrients) and physical (coarse substrate and slope angle of 40-50°) characteristics displayed by the overburden piles constituted limitations to floristic diversity and size of indigenous trees, indicating the need for substrate reclamation prior to forest restoration. © 2007 Society for Ecological Restoration International.

AB  - Galling insects may represent an excellent tool to evaluate habitat quality and restoration. We used galling insect species richness to evaluate the success of a project on reforestation in an Atlantic Forest area in southeastern Brazil. We selected 18 study sites from three distinct environments under succession: early stage (3-5 years old abandoned pasture), intermediate stage (10-15 years old), and intermediate stage sites under Myracrodruon urundeuva trees (10-15 years old). The highest galling species richness was found in the intermediate stage sites, followed by areas of early stages, while intermediate sites under M. urundeuva trees supported the lowest richness. The significant difference between areas under M. urundeuva and the other two suggests that this plant negatively impacts the plant community. Personal observations suggest an allelopathic activity of M. urundeuva, decreasing native species establishment, consequently reducing associated herbivore richness. Our results indicate that galling species were efficient tools to evaluate environmental quality in a degraded area of Atlantic Forest. © 2007 Instituto de Ciências Biológicas - UFMG.

AB  - An area's innate potential to regenerate represents a crucial factor for its conservation and management. The seed rain and seed bank are important agents in the regeneration process. Seed banks are particularly important in communities where there is a high proportion of obligate seeders. Rocky outcrops are habitats where most part of the plant species depends on their seeds to reproduce and maintain viable populations. Therefore, seed banks ought to be important in this vegetation physiognomy. We test the hypotheses that the seed bank of the rocky outcrops found in the rupestrian fields of "Serra do Cipó", Brazil, is richer in species and denser than those formed on different vegetation physiognomies neighboring the outcrops. We then compared species abundance, species richness and composition in the rocky outcrops' seed banks with those of sandy and peaty bogs, forests, gallery forests, and "cerrados". Furthermore, we report on the natural regeneration potential of these soils by assessing a greenhouse study on seedling emergence. Soil samples were collected from 0 to 5 and 5 to 10 cm of depth. Rocky outcrops had the poorest in species and less dense seed bank and showed segregation in species composition. Emergence was greater in the most superficial layer. However, soils on rocky outcrops showed the greatest proportion of endemic threatened species in their seed banks, demonstrating their importance for biodiversity conservation of the "Serra do Cipó" rupestrian fields.

AB  - Leaf-cutting ants (species of Atta and Acromyrmex) are dominant herbivores and play a key role as ecosystem engineers of tropical and subtropical America (Fowler et al. 1989, Weber 1972). Not only are they among the most polyphagous and voracious herbivorous insects, cutting up to 15% y1 of the leaf standing crop (Urbas et al. 2007, Wirth et al. 2003), but also they strongly affect the light environment and the nature of plant assemblages via ant-nest-mediated disturbances (Farji-Brener & Illes 2000, Hull-Sanders & Howard 2003, Moutinho et al. 2003). Some leaf-cutting ant species have turned into an omnipresent feature of present-day neotropical landscapes and a wealth of studies has documented their abundance to drastically increase with increasing agricultural land use, disturbance and deforestation/fragmentation (Fowler et al. 1986, Jaffe 1986, Terborgh et al. 2001, Vasconcelos & Cherrett 1995, Wirth et al. 2007). In view of their ecosystem engineering capacity and the ever-increasing conversion of tropical forests into agricultural landscapes (Wright 2005), it has been concluded that disturbance-driven accumulation of Atta colonies leads to far-reaching and deleterious consequences in present-day neotropical landscapes (Wirth et al. 2008). But what about the opposite scenario of regenerating forests? Is disturbance-mediated hyper-abundance of leaf-cutting ants a reversible phenomenon? We believe that this question is highly relevant because (1) knowledge of the dynamics of leaf-cutting ant populations during forest regeneration is lacking and (2) natural secondary succession has become a widespread phenomenon after land is abandoned or temporarily fallowed (Wright 2005). In the Brazilian Amazon during the 1990s, for example, secondary forests have reclaimed 31% of the once deforested land (Perz & Skole 2003). Copyright © 2009 Cambridge University Press.

AB  - Recent discussions of local knowledge emphasize its dynamic nature invoking local peoples' ability to effectively integrate traditional or local with science-based or "modern" knowledges. The smallholder timber industry of the Amazon's estuarine floodplain provides an outstanding example of local patterns of resource management and economic activities transformed from within by smallholder farmers who participated in the industrial timber boom of the 1970s and 1980s. These farmers of eastern Amazonia have developed a vertically integrated local industry based on expertise reflecting profound locally developed knowledge of specific forests and management of ecological processes, individual observation and experimentation, as well as concepts and practices derived from temporary employment by large-scale industrial timber firms. At each stage of the smallholder forestry process - from managing natural regeneration to running small sawmills and marketing lumber - local managers apply an innovative set of practices reflecting their diverse experiences. This combination of technical, market, and ecological knowledge results in forests, timber markets, and economic patterns that do not correspond to many of the widely-held generalizations concerning either local or industrial tropical timber exploitation. This article uses data from 7 years of research in the Amazon floodplain. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2007.

AB  - Advanced recruitment and neutral processes play important roles in determining tree species composition in tropical forest canopy gaps, with few gaps experiencing clear secondary successional processes. However, most studies are limited to the relatively limited spatial scales provided by forest inventory plots, and investigations over the entire range of gap size are needed to better understand how ecological processes vary with tree mortality events. This study employed a landscape approach to test the hypothesis that tree species composition and forest structural attributes differ between large blowdown gaps and relatively undisturbed primary forest. Spectral mixture analysis on hyperspectral satellite imagery was employed to direct field sampling to widely distributed sites, and blowdown plots were compared with undisturbed primary forest plots. Tree species composition and forest structural attributes differed markedly between gap and non-gap sites, providing evidence of niche partitioning in response to disturbance across the region. Large gaps were dominated by classic Neotropical pioneer genera such as Cecropia and Vismia, and average tree size was significantly smaller. Mean wood density of trees recovering in large gaps (0.55 g cm-3) was significantly lower than in primary forest plots (0.71 g cm-3), a difference similar to that found when comparing less dynamic (i.e., tree recruitment, growth, and mortality) Central Amazon forests with more dynamic Western Amazon forests. Based on results, we hypothesize that the importance of neutral processes weaken, and niche processes strengthen, in determining community assembly along a gradient in gap size and tree mortality intensity. Over evolutionary time scales, pervasive dispersal among colonizers could result in the loss of tree diversity in the pioneer guild through competitive exclusion. Results also underscore the importance of considering disturbance processes across the landscape when addressing forest carbon balance. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - This work is a taxonomic study of woody taxa of Papilionoideae in “cerrado” and seasonal semideciduous forest at the Estação Ambiental de Volta Grande. This environmental station is localized within the Triângulo Mineiro, to the southwest of the state of Minas Gerais, and belongs to the Companhia Energética de Minas Gerais, covering 391ha and portraying 30 years of natural regeneration. Fourteen taxa distributed in 11 genera and four tribes were reported for the subfamily. Dalbergieae, with Centrolobium, Dalbergia, Machaerium and Platypodium; and Sophoreae, with Acosmium, Bowdichia, Myroxylon and Ormosia were the most representative tribes, followed by Dipterygeae, with Dipteryx and Pterodon and Robinieae, with Sesbania. Three species of Machaerium, and two species of Acosmium were found, while the other genera were represented by one species each. An identification key, descriptions and illustrations are presented for the taxa studied, as well as comments regarding their geographical distribution. © 2007 Instituto de Pesquisas Jardim Botanico do Rio de Janeiro.All right reserved.

AB  - Plantation forests and second-growth forests are becoming dominant components of many tropical forest landscapes. Yet there is little information available concerning the consequences of different forestry options for biodiversity conservation in the tropics. We sampled the leaf-litter herpetofauna of primary, secondary, and Eucalyptus plantation forests in the Jari River area of northeastern Brazilian Amazonia. We used four complementary sampling techniques, combined samples from 2 consecutive years, and collected 1739 leaf-litter amphibians (23 species) and 1937 lizards (30 species). We analyzed the data for differences among forest types regarding patterns of alpha and beta diversity, species-abundance distributions, and community structure. Primary rainforest harbored significantly more species, but supported a similar abundance of amphibians and lizards compared with adjacent areas of second-growth forest or plantations. Plantation forests were dominated by wide-ranging habitat generalists. Secondary forest faunas contained a number of species characteristic of primary forest habitat. Amphibian communities in secondary forests and Eucalyptus plantations formed a nested subset of primary forest species, whereas the species composition of the lizard community in plantations was distinct, and was dominated by open-area species. Although plantation forests are relatively impoverished, naturally regenerating forests can help mitigate some negative effects of deforestation for herpetofauna. Nevertheless, secondary forest does not provide a substitute for primary forest, and in the absence of further evidence from older successional stands, we caution against the optimistic claim that natural forest regeneration in abandoned lands will provide refuge for the many species that are currently threatened by deforestation. © 2007 Society for Conservation Biology.

AB  - Nearly all published rates of secondary forest (SF) regrowth for Amazonia are inferred from chronosequences. We examined SF regrowth on abandoned pastures over a 4-year period to determine if measured rates of forest recovery differ from chronosequence predictions. We studied the emergence, development and death of over 1300 stems in 10 SFs representing three age classes (<1-5, 6-10 and 11-14 years old). Mean tree biomass accumulation in both the <1-5 and 6-10 years old (4.4 and 5.7Mg ha-1yr-1, respectively) abandoned pastures was lower than predicted and deviated significantly (57% and 41%) from rates estimated from the chronosequence. The older SFs, with a mean growth rate of 9.9Mg ha-1yr-1 followed the rate predicted by the chronosequence. Understocking was the primary cause of low biomass recovery rates in the youngest forests; although the youngest stands had a diameter at breast height increment three times the oldest stands, the youngest stands lacked sufficient density to cumulatively produce high biomass accumulation rates. Four years of measurement indicated that the youngest stands had developed 59% of the stems measured in the older stands during the same time period. The 6-10-year-old stands were rapidly self-thinning and approached stem density values measured in the same aged stands at the onset of the study. Mortality was high for all stands, with 54% of the original stems remaining after 4 years in intermediate-aged stands. The forests were dominated by the tree Vismia, which represented 55-66% of the biomass in all stands. The Vismia share of the biomass was decreasing over time, with other genera replacing the pioneer. Our measured rates of regrowth indicate that generalized estimates of forest regrowth through chronosequence studies will overestimate forest regrowth for the youngest forests that were under land use for longer time-periods before abandonment. Certified Emission Reductions under the Clean Development Mechanism of the Kyoto protocol should consider these results when predicting and compensating for carbon sequestered under natural forest management. © 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Analysis of floristic similarity relationships between plant communities can detect patterns of species occurrence and also explain conditioning factors. Searching for such patterns, floristic similarity relationships among Atlantic Forest sites situated at Ibiúna Plateau, São Paulo state, Brazil, were analyzed by multivariate techniques. Twenty one forest fragments and six sites within a continuous Forest Reserve were included in the analyses. Floristic composition and structure of the tree community (minimum dbh 5 cm) were assessed using the point centered quarter method. Two methods were used for multivariate analysis: Detrended Correspondence Analysis (DCA) and Two-Way Indicator Species Analysis (TWINSPAN). Similarity relationships among the study areas were based on the successional stage of the community and also on spatial proximity. The more similar the successional stage of the communities, the higher the floristic similarity between them, especially if the communities are geographically close. A floristic gradient from north to south was observed, suggesting a transition between biomes, since northern indicator species are mostly heliophytes, occurring also in cerrado vegetation and seasonal semideciduous forest, while southern indicator species are mostly typical ombrophilous and climax species from typical dense evergreen Atlantic Forest.

AB  - Aquaculture grew rapidly in economic importance for many Latin and South American countries from 1978 to 1998. At least six countries in Latin and South America (Ecuador, Nicaragua, Honduras, Belize, Guatemala, and Brazil) derived over a third of their annual export income from shrimp in the late 1990s. However, the entry of Taura syndrome virus (TSV) in 1989 and white spot syndrome virus (WSSV) from Asia in early 1999 created a series of severe economic issues that came close to bankrupting some countries; for example, the production of shrimp in Ecuador, once the largest shrimp aquaculture producer in the world, fell 75 percent in a single year. In countries such as Ecuador, the value of shrimp had been 52 percent of the total export value balance of trade in 1997, and the loss of 65 percent of the crop production precipitated default on International Monetary Fund (IMF) loans and the failure or closure of virtually every bank in the country (Rosenberry 2000). A retrospective on the economics of the "shrimp disaster of 1999" (Clifford and Cook 2002) showed that while shrimp disease was the immediate trigger to economic failure of the industry in general and several countries, in particular, the root of the problem extended back over a decade to a foreign money policy that could be supported only if growth in the industry continued indefinitely, in a kind of biological Ponzi scheme. Even more revealing was the fact that the same economic outcome had been produced by the earlier TSV outbreak of 1989. The economic lessons that might have been learned from that were ignored as developing countries moved toward globalized marketing of one of their principal exports. Chief among the many economic problems that surfaced was that the IMF loans were made based on a series of unrealistic assumptions regarding the profitability of shrimp production. With the massive increase-7,600 percent between 1978 and 1989-in the monoculture of white shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei), the world supply exceeded demand for shrimp, generating a commensurate and predictable decrease in average price (figure 27.1a). From 1989 to 1999, excessive production had decreased the value of the crop to the point where the interest on debt could not be serviced. This is quite similar to the situation with bananas discussed in chapter 9 and with many other commodities exported by developing countries, such as coffee and peanuts. The TSV outbreak of 1989 reduced shrimp supplies and stabilized prices for a time. However, it ignored the decreased value margin in the white shrimp fisheries and the biological reasons for the increased likelihood of disease transmission. The IMF continued to loan money to "repair" the losses of the TSV outbreak. The land area involved in shrimp production trebled between 1990 and 1995, at great expense to the salt marsh areas and, to a lesser extent, to natural mangrove areas in the coastal zones of Latin America. The destruction of 35 percent of the mangrove areas (in Ecuador, Panama, Guatemala, Nicaragua, and Honduras) in a 20-year period reduced the production areas for wild shrimp and all but destroyed the small, but stable, shrimp trawl fishery that had been in existence for 150 years. A detailed study conducted by Auburn University has shown that roughly 30 percent of the mangrove forest destruction was directly attributable to shrimp farming development (Massaut 1999). Ecuador, for example, had lost 25 percent of its mangroves since 1970, with an annual deforestation rate of 0.78 percent. By 1994, prices fell again as production again reached record levels, yet the debt service of the initial IMF loans made in the 1978-92 period remained fixed. By 1998, Ecuador was almost totally dependent on shrimp (20 percent of all Ecuadorian exports, with a record of $872 million) and oil (about 50 percent of all exports) as export products to bring foreign currency into the country, most of which had to go to service previous foreign debt. For every dollar of shrimp production added between 1990 and 1999, growers had to import some $0.68-0.72 worth of foreign goods, such as feed and construction equipment. Thus, the net foreign exchange gained was only about 30 percent of the gross! Shrimp reached an amazing 52 percent of the gross export value for the country (this percentage is related to the $1.6 billion of trade with United States only, not with the total Ecuadorian exports of $4.2 billion), yet the profitability of shrimp production to these countries, even from what had become the largest shrimp-producing export nation in the world, was inadequate to service even the interest on the international debt. The inability to service this debt led the IMF to decline further investment in supporting the Ecuadorian economy in 1998, forcing the closure of all banks and seizure of private assets on deposit to temporarily service the existing debt. This, in turn, eliminated further investment in shrimp farming, and those farms without their own hatcheries could not even afford to restock the farms in the fall of 1998. More than 140,000 jobs were lost in a period of only three months. Farmers who could afford to restock were literally reduced to eating their own crop to survive. By 2002, only 200 hatcheries were active, there were only about 126,000 remaining shrimp workers, and 175,000 ha of shrimp ponds had been abandoned, representing 60 percent of land used in 1998. The shrimp exports had dropped from the record of $872 million in 1998 to $280 million in 2001. Unlike their response to the TSV, IMF, and WSSV economic disasters of the past, a newly emerging Ecuadorian industry is focused on solving the real biological/environmental problems that precipitated the disease outbreaks and is decoupling shrimp production from the more sensitive estuarine environments (by moving to environments such as salt flats or dry forest areas), by moving toward policies of decreased water exchange, and by increasing biosecurity. But in Ecuador, the salt flats were all occupied by 1995, and the attempt to use freshwater systems have met little success, even adding to the country's woes by generating salt contamination of groundwater supplies. Nevertheless, the implementation of these environmental policies by Latin and South American shrimp-producing countries has allowed the new generation of shrimp growers to recognize the true environmental costs of shrimp production and reduce the direct impact on the environment The new generation of shrimp growers in Ecuador certainly has increased biosecurity; however, the production costs have greatly increased for semiintensive farms from about $6,000-$8,000/ha (1998) to $27,000/ha (2003). This increase in production costs has discouraged small and mediumsize growers, so that only large enterprises can afford to continue in the business. Sadly, this World Bank-sponsored fiasco in Ecuador, followed by IMF foreign investment rescue scenarios, has been repeated in Honduras, Nicaragua, and Panama, as well, in the last three decades. We will look at the shrimp industry and current developing measures, which place greater value and recognition on the true environmental costs of conducting business in a developing country, independent of outside investments focused on global markets. We also examine what the "blue revolution" has contributed and future prospects for better aquaculture technology. © 2007 by the University of New Mexico Press. All rights reserved.

AB  - Increasing energy use, climate change, and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from fossil fuels make switching to low-carbon fuels a high priority. Biofuels are a potential low-carbon energy source, but whether biofuels offer carbon savings depends on how they are produced. Converting rainforests, peatlands, savannas, or grasslands to produce food crop-based biofuels in Brazil, Southeast Asia, and the United States creates a "biofuel carbon debt" by releasing 17 to 420 times more CO2 than the annual greenhouse gas (GHG) reductions that these biofuels would provide by displacing fossil fuels. In contrast, biofuels made from waste biomass or from biomass grown on degraded and abandoned agricultural lands planted with perennials incur little or no carbon debt and can offer immediate and sustained GHG advantages.

AB  - Fire is commonly used to establish and maintain pastures in the Amazon. Fire is also known to induce soil water repellency but few published data exist for the humid tropics. The objectives of this study were to characterise the intensity and spatial variability of water repellency on previously burned pasture soils in the Amazon, and its effect on the nutrient status of the forage grass Brachiaria brizantha (Hochst.) Stapf. Surface soils of pastures and forests in north-western Mato Grosso, Brazil, were found to exhibit soil water repellency using MED and WDPT tests. Soil water repellency was found only within 0-0.01 m of the mineral soil surface, with soil below 0.01 m found to be hydrophilic in all cases. Spatial variability of repellency was high for both pasture and forest soils. For pasture soils, soil water repellency was strongest on recently burned pastures, which exhibited some extremely high values (MED >8 M). Repellency decreased rapidly with time following burning. Increasing soil water repellency was associated with decreasing N:P ratios of B. brizantha above-ground biomass (r2 = 0.66, P = 0.004). These findings indicate that soil water repellency and pasture productivity are inversely related. Since pasture abandonment fuels continued deforestation, disrupting the processes causing pasture degradation may lead to more sustainable land use in the Amazon. © CSIRO 2005.

AB  - The knowledge about the morphological aspects of both seeds and seedlings has several applications, such as in taxonomy, interpretation of the germination tests under laboratory conditions, in nurseries, as well as in ecological studies. Therefore, the goals of this work were to describe and illustrated both internal and external morphologies of the fruits and seeds as well as the germination phases and seedling development of mulungu (Erythrina velutina Willd.). The fruits and seeds were collected in the soil, which were dispersed by trees distributed throughout different forest fragments in the district of Areia in the State of Paraiba, Brazil. One hundred units were randomly selected for the morphological description of the fruits, seeds and germination phases. The results showed that the seed was reniform; had axial embryo with pulpous cotyledons; epigeal phanerocotylar and showed the presence of heterophylly at the seedlings phases. The described and illustrated aspects were homogeneous and reliable for the identification of the species. Thus, the results are useful in the technological work for evaluation of the physiological quality of the seeds as well as for evaluation of seedling morphology during germination tests. In addition, the results are useful for identification of the species in nurseries and in natural regeneration studies.

AB  - This research represents one of the first studies in Amazonia to examine soil moisture and water-use efficiency (WUE) in secondary forest (SF) vegetation regrowing on abandoned pastures subjected to reduced nutrient constraints via a nutrient addition experiment. Extensive forested areas (about 80% of deforestation) have been converted to pastures in Amazonia, which were later abandoned following soil degradation and reduction in grass productivity. Colonization of these areas proceeds through species adapted to adverse edaphic conditions, such as low soil nutrients. Yet there is little data from such environments showing the interaction of soil nutrients and water availability on plant physiological processes. The objective of this study was to test whether three common SF tree species have positive physiological responses, e.g. increased photosynthesis and water-use efficiency, when nutrient limitations are relaxed through fertilization. The experiment was conducted on an abandoned pasture in central Amazonia with 6-year-old secondary vegetation following the application of four treatments: control; +phosphorus (P); +phosphorus and lime (P + Ca); and +phosphorus, lime and gypsum (P + Ca + G). The control had higher mean soil moisture at 140 and 180 cm depth at the end of the dry season, indicating that the treatment plots responded positively to fertilizer additions by taking up additional water. Trees of Vismia japurensis and Bellucia grossularioides growing on the fertilized plots had the highest net photosynthesis rates (A) (18.7 and 20.4 μmol m-2 s-1, respectively). The three species utilized different strategies with regard to physiological and nutritional response, with V. japurensis, regardless of treatment, using these limiting resources most efficiently to colonize abandoned pastures. Trees growing on the P + Ca but not +P alone plots increased A rates, indicating that Ca is an important limiting nutrient in post-pasture secondary succession. The addition of Ca as ash by burning primary and secondary vegetation could explain the rapid growth and dominance of V. japurensis in abandoned pasture areas in central Amazonia. The efficiency of Vismia to use limiting resources could lead to a restructuring of SF and altered rates of stand-level productivity. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Caesalpinia echinata Lam. (Caesalpiniaceae) is a tree species that naturally regenerates in the forest understory and reaches the upper canopy through small gaps. We conducted a study with the objective of comparing some aspects of leaf morphology of adult individuals, in which the leaves were exposed to full sunlight, and saplings, grown in the forest understory. The study was conducted in a semidecidual forest in Jussari, southern Bahia, Brazil. Initially, eight adult and eight sapling individuals were selected and marked. In September/October, 2004 and April, 2005 eight leaves for each adult and three leaves for each sapling individual were collected and analyzed. In general, the area of leaves, rachis and leaflets, the length of rachis, the width of leaves, the number of pinnes and the dried mass of leaves were significantly higher in young individuals. Notwithstanding, the specific mass of leaves and leaflets were significantly higher in the adults. For both, adults and saplings, strong relationships were observed between the leaf dried mass and leaf area. Based on the results, we conclude that the leaves of C. echinata present characteristics that allow the maximization of light absorption in environments in which light radiation is a limiting factor, at the same time allocating carbon to the support tissues. The results obtained in the present study were in accordance with the successional status of this tree species and its strategies to occupy small canopy gaps of the semidecidual forest environments.

AB  - Failures in reforestation are often attributed to nutrient limitation for tree growth. We compared tree performance and nitrogen and phosphorus relations in adjacent mixed-species plantings of contrasting composition, established for forest restoration on Ultisol soil, originally covered by tropical semi-deciduous Atlantic Forest in Southeast Brazil. Nutrient relations of four tree species occurring in both planting mixtures were compared between a legume-dominated, species-poor direct seeding mixture of early-successional species ("legume mixture"), and a species-diverse, legume-poor mixture of all successional groups ("diverse mixture"). After 7 years, the legume mixture had 6-fold higher abundance of N2-fixing trees, 177% higher total tree basal area, 22% lower litter C/N, six-fold higher in situ soil resin-nitrate, and 40% lower in situ soil resin-P, compared to the diverse mixture. In the legume mixture, non-N2-fixing legume Schizolobium parahyba (Fabaceae-Caesalpinioideae) had significantly lower proportional N resorption, and both naturally regenerating non-legume trees had significantly higher leaf N concentrations, and higher proportional P resorption, than in the diverse mixture. This demonstrate forms of plastic adjustment in all three non-N2-fixing species to diverged nutrient relations between mixtures. By contrast, leaf nutrient relations in N2-fixing Enterolobium contortisiliquum (Fabaceae-Mimosoideae) did not respond to planting mixtures. Rapid N accumulation in the legume mixture caused excess soil nitrification over nitrate immobilization and tighter P recycling compared with the diverse mixture. The legume mixture succeeded in accelerating tree growth and canopy closure, but may imply periods of N losses and possibly P limitation. Incorporation of species with efficient nitrate uptake and P mobilization from resistant soil pools offers potential to optimize these tradeoffs. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - It has been reported that forest fragmentation modifies the richness and/or the abundance of communities. To test this hypothesis it was evaluated the fauna of termites of six fragments of stationary semideciduous forest and an area in early succession. In each one it was designed a transect (100 m x 2 m), divided into 20 plots (5 m x 2 m). In ten of these plots the collections were conducted under stones, in the nests, trunks and branches, over/under trunk barks and in five soil samples (340 cm3) of the A-horizon by plot with a sampling effort of 60 minutes/plot. The composition, the observed and estimated species richness, the relation between area and observed richness, as well as the occurrence and dominance patterns of each species were analyzed. Eleven species from nine genera and two families (Kalotermitidae and Termitidae) were collected, rising the number of species registered in the state from 14 to 18. The subfamily, Apicotermitinae with the upper species richness (S=6), was found in five of the seven areas, while Nasutitermitinae, with the second highest number of species (Sobs=4), was collected in all areas. The richness varied from two to six species, and was not related to the area size. Five species were considered rare, but the others were intermediate. The areas were grouped in four groups with 60, 57, 50 and 40% of similarity, with the species composition as the highest difference between them, suggesting that fragmentation of the local forest influenced more the composition than the richness of termites.

AB  - Litter fall and leaf decomposition represent important functional processes, yet we have a limited understanding of these processes in disturbed and regenerating tropical habitats. Litter production, litterfall phenology and leaf decomposition were examined in primary forests, 14-19-year-old secondary forests and 4-5-year-old Eucalyptus urophylla plantations in the north-east Brazilian Amazon. Total annual litter fall was similar in primary and secondary forests, and lower in plantations. Leaf fall in primary and secondary forests was negatively associated with rainfall, and was highest in the dry season. Leaf fall in Eucalyptus plantations showed an opposite response, and peaked during the wet season. Decomposition experiments were carried out in the three habitats using 1200 litter bags (1 mm mesh) filled separately with leaves from four different species of tree, including an exotic plantation species (E. urophylla) and trees typical of secondary (Bellucia spp. and Vismia spp.) and primary forests (Bertholettia excelsa). Litter bags were re-weighed at 3-month intervals 3, 6, 9 and 12 months after being placed on the forest floor. A repeated measures General Linear Model showed that litter decomposition was similar in the primary and secondary forest, and slowest in the Eucalyptus plantations. Leaves decomposed, from fastest to slowest, in the following order: E. urophylla > B. excelsa > Vismia spp. > Bellucia spp. There was no significant interaction between leaf species and habitat type. Our results indicate that secondary forests regenerating on abandoned and degraded Amazonian lands can be effective at restoring ecosystem processes such as litterfall and decomposition. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) species diversity and mycorrhizal inoculum potential were assessed in areas representative of stages of secondary succession in the Brazilian Atlantic Rain Forest. Within each stage - pioneer, 'capoeirinha' and 'capoeirão'- four transects were established and three soil samples were taken along each transect. The plant community was dominated by Pteridium aquilinium in the pioneer stage, while Dodonaea viscosa and P. aquilinium were co-dominants in the 'capoeirinha' stage. In capoeirão, Miconia cinnamomifolia was dominant followed by Euterpe edulis. Total spore number per 100 g soil was significantly larger in the 'capoeirinha' stage than in the other stages, although the number of viable spores was similar among stages. Acaulosporaceae and Glomeraceae were the predominant families accounting for 83% of the total spores recovered. Of the 18 spore morphotypes, 10 were allocated to known species, with Acaulospora sp. and Glomus sp. being the dominants recovered in all samples. Simpson's index of diversity and evenness for AMF species were not significantly different among the successional stages and AMF species richness was negatively correlated with plant species richness. Soil from 'Capoeirinha" showed the highest inoculum potential (37%). Dominance of the mycorrhizal community by few sporulators and the relationship between plant and fungal diversity are discussed.

AB  - Mixed plantations of indigenous tree species aims to catalyze forest regeneration in the ecological restoration of degraded areas. This work analyzes the performance of 26 tree species planted in the lowland areas at the Reserva Biológica de Poço das Antas, in Silva Jardim municipality, Rio de Janeiro State, Brazil. Three experimental plantings, with áreas ranging from 0.64 to 1.17 ha were evaluated. A successional planting model divided species into four functional groups: pioneers and early secondaries (shading species), and late secondaries and climax (shaded species). In order to evaluate the performance of the species, we evaluated survival rate and development (growth rate and diameter at the plant base - DAS) of the seedlings planted. All the early species used had a good performance, both for the survival and growth rates, especially Citharexylum myrianthus, Schinus terebinthifolius and Trema micrantha. After early species shaded the degraded site, late species grew faster, as could be observed for Calophyllum brasiliense, Copaifera langsdorffii and Guarea guidonia, suggesting the successional model is effective in accelerating Forest regeneration. Jacaratia spinosa and Plathymenia foliolosa are late species which showed fast growth, as early species do, and may be classified as anthropogenic pioneer species. The model using indigenous tree species showed an excellent performance, both for survival and growth rates, and have a great potential to restablish ecological processes in degraded areas at the Reserva Biológica de Poço das Antas and in similar areas surrounding. © Instituto de Pesquisas Jardim Botanico do Rio de Janeiro.

AB  - We assessed seed fate of six tree species in a seasonally deciduous forest of Central Brazil. Seed germination, predation, removal and death caused by pathogens or dessication were followed in an undisturbed forest site, a logged forest site, and an active pasture. In both forest types we sowed seeds under patches of liana tangles (Low Forest habitat) and under patches of mature forest (High Forest habitat). Seeds were monitored weekly for up to 8 months. Overall, small-seeded species (Astronium fraxinifolium and Tabebuia impetiginosa) had high germination, although germination was lower in the pasture due to insect predation. The hard-coated seeds of Erythrina sp. had higher germination rates in the pasture. The large-seeded Cavanillesia arborea and Swartzia multijuga had high seed removal (ca. 90%) in the pasture and under High Forest, but only 23-34% under Low Forest in the logged site. Lower removal of large seeds in Low Forest suggests that this habitat conceals the seeds and constrains the movement of large mammals. Both species were favored in Low Forest, suggesting that caution should be used when managing lianas. When protected from predation, seeds with a soft coat and high water content, such as the seeds of Eugenia dysenterica and S. multijuga, died from desiccation in the pasture. Restoration efforts must take into consideration high mortality caused by desiccation or insect predation in abandoned pastures of dry forests. © 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - This ammonia pipeline is about 30 km long and links the Fertilizer Plant (FAFEN-BA) to the Urea Marine Terminal (TMU) at the Port of Aratu in Candeias (Bahia State, Brazil). In this study, we characterize the remnants of vegetation and quantify the Permanent Preservation Areas. Furthermore, we propose areas and techniques for their recovery and / or management. The methodology was based on the Rapid Ecological Assessment, which combines selection of areas through remote sensing image analysis, with rapid field campaigns in the selected points. This methodology, successfully applied in Petrobras refineries, is first applied in a pipeline influence area. During these campaigns, the main aspects of vegetation, such as phytophysiognomy and ecological succession stages, were registered in field data sheets prepared for this purpose. The most representative remnants of vegetation that could be quantified were Atlantic Forest fragments, as well as those in the Permanent Preservation Areas.

AB  - Soil seed banks are considered an important mechanism for natural regeneration in tropical forest ecosystems. This paper investigated the soil seed bank in two semideciduous seasonal tropical forest fragments with different disturbance histories in Botucatu, southeastern Brazil. In each study site, 40 superficial soil samples (30 cm × 30 cm × 5 cm) were taken at the end of both the dry and rainy seasons. The seeds were estimated by the germination method. Average soil seed density was 588.6 and 800.3 seeds m-2, respectively, for site 1 (less disturbed) and site 2 (more disturbed). Seed density and diversity (H′) were significantly higher in site 2 in both seasons. Non-woody taxa predominated in both fragments, but pioneer tree species were better represented in the less disturbed forest. Both ecosystems have a potential for regeneration from soil seed banks, but this potential is higher in the less disturbed site. Low richness and density of pioneer tree species in the seed bank indicate that the ecosystem has lost its resilience. The seed bank is not as important in these ecosystems as in other forests. Results indicate that management strategies to restore these forests should take into account the possibility of recovering soil seed bank processes and dynamics. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The galling insect community in a disturbed area of Atlantic rain forest is described for the first time in the context of environmental restoration in the RPPN Fazenda Bulcão, Minas Gerais, Brazil. We provide information on the external morphology of the galls, their occurrence on host plant organs, host plant species, and habitat types were they were collected. We sampled galls in three different habitats: abandoned pasture, secondary succession vegetation, and secondary succession vegetation dominated by Miracruodon urundeuva (Anacardiaceae), totaling 22 sites. Within these sites we encountered 29 gall morphotypes associated to 24 host-plant species. The majority of the galls (93%) were induced by Cecidomyiidae (Diptera). Abandoned pastures contained the greatest gall-species richness (19 morphotypes), followed by secondary succession vegetation dominated by M. urundeuva (16 morphotypes) and secondary succession vegetation (10 morphotypes). The diversity of galling insects encountered at Fazenda Bulcão was considered very low in comparison to that of the entire mid Rio Doce region. © 2006 Instituto de Ciências Biológicas - UFMG.

AB  - Recent studies indicate that after protection from human pressures (fire, cattle grazing and agriculture), structural changes occur in the cerrado vegetation, changing open physiognomies into more closed savannas. We analyzed the dynamics of vegetation types along 44 years, at Assis Ecological Station, one of the rare conservation units protecting the cerrado biome in the southeastern São Paulo State, Brazil, with the aim of characterizing and quantifying those changes in space and time. Protected against human pressures since a long time, field observations have shown an upgrade of local cerrado physiognomies, through a successional process whose structural climax can be a forest physiognomy, with a continuous arboreal stratum. The dynamics of the vegetation types was analyzed by using aerial photographs (1962, 1984 and 1994), Quick Bird satellite images (2006) and field surveys. During this 44 years period, field physiognomies were reduced from 23% to less than 1% of the total area studied. In the other extreme, woodland savanna increased from 53% to 91% of the area. Changes did not happen at the same rhythm across the area, and that is apparently correlated to microclimate and edaphyc differences. We believe that field and savannic physiognomies initially existing were mostly maintained due to heavy human pressures, constraining the secondary succession towards an edapho-climatic climax of greater biomass. Confirming the observations of cerrado areas elsewhere, protection against fire, cattle grazing and agriculture allowed the evolution of open vegetation types into more closed ones, tending to be locally extinct the first if new disturbances do not occur. Consequences of these changes related to management strategies, biodiversity conservation and carbon sink are discussed.

AB  - We describe the tree structure of three Atlantic Forest fragments on the coast of Paraná, in order to detect differences in community structure throughout the succession process and to support future vegetation restoration projects. The study area was the Reserva Natural Rio Cachoeira, where three sites were chosen based on length of time since the last manmade disturbance (mostly agriculture and lodging); these were, respectively, 20-, 80- and 120-year-old forests. The 20-year-old forest had the lowest richness, diversity, basal area and volume. The 80-year-old forest had the highest density and richness. The 120-year-old forest had the highest diversity, equitability and volume. Diversity, basal area and volume were significantly different among the three sites. There were no important differences among structures of populations of species shared by the three areas. On the other hand, structural characteristics of exclusive species were important to determine differences among sites.

AB  - The floristic composition of the natural regeneration in a secondary Seasonal Semideciduous Forest fragment in the Atlantic Forest domain, Southeastern Brazil, was studied in the years 1992, 1995 and 2000. The sampling unit sizes were 0.5x10m, 0.5x20m and 1x20m, respectively, for plant size class 1 (height up to 1 m), class 2 (height from 1 to 3 m) and class 3 (height > 3m and DBH < 5cm). A total of 4,149 individuals were sampled over the inventory period, comprising 42 families and 160 species, being 11.7 % pioneer, 62.1 % early secondary, and 26.2 % late secondary species. Family number did not change and number of species increased with time. Fabaceae, Myrtaceae, Rubiaceae and Lauraceae were the predominant families. Species ingrowth was higher than mortality. Shannon-Weaver diversity index was significantly lower (P ≤ 0.05) only for the plant size class 1 as compared to the other size classes, in 1992, and it increased significantly from 3.45 (average of all plant size classes), in 1992, to 3.67 and 3.64 in 1995 and 2000, respectively. The Pielou equability index per inventory date varied from 0.71 to 0.74, and it was 0.71; 0. 79 and 0.82 for the size classes 1, 2 and 3, respectively. Overall, the results showed that monitoring the natural regeneration over an age sequence is important to understand the dynamics of the secondary forest fragments.

AB  - The effects of neighboring vegetation and soil fertility on the establishment, survival and growth of tree species were studied in a subtropical old-field area in south Brazil. Seed damage, germination and seedling establishment of four tree species plus growth and survival of two transplanted tree species were monitored under factorial combinations of the following treatments: (1) pioneer vegetation (presence and absence); (2) soil fertility (addition of NPK and control). Facilitation was the main process affecting plant performance. The presence of pioneer vegetation significantly improved germination, establishment, growth and survival of most study species. Around 90% of sown seeds were damaged and the removal of pioneer vegetation significantly increased seed damage for all species studied, decreased germination in three out of four species, and decreased establishment in one species. Moreover a significantly higher seedling growth rate of Inga virescens was found after the first year of the experiment in plots where vegetation was present. The presence of vegetation significantly increased seedling survival of I. virescens by protecting seedlings from leaf loss due to winter frosts. Competition was detected by the second year when a higher growth of transplanted seedlings of the species Araucaria angustifolia occurred in plots where vegetation was present and fertilizer were applied. A lower growth rate was detected in plots where vegetation was present but fertilizer was not applied. These results indicate a balance between competition for soil nutrients and protection by neighbor vegetation. Damage of seedlings by leaf cutter ants was an important barrier for plant survival. Damage occurred in 80% of the A. angustifolia seedlings and 58% of these damaged seedlings died. The presence of neighboring vegetation tended to protect seedlings from ant damage. Although competition occurred, facilitation seems to be the main process driving early successional changes in this subtropical old field. This was mainly due to the improvement of local microclimatic conditions and protection against herbivores by neighboring vegetation. Facilitation occurred during establishment and growth phases in a subtropical area that is considered a productive, low stress environment. Our results indicate that facilitation may be more frequent in productive environments than previously thought. © Springer 2006.

AB  - Turvo Park in the Alto Uruguay River region of the State of Rio Grande do Sul is the last intact remnant of the Seasonally Deciduous Forest in southern Brazil. This forest once covered large parts of southern Brazil but it is now reduced to less than 3% of its original size due to intensive logging caused by its exceptional richness in tree species with commercial timber value. The current study presents results on the diversity of timber species inventored in Turvo Park and in a number of small and scattered forest remnants in its vicinity. All timber plants with DBH ≥5 cm were included in the forest inventory on 540 sampling points, established using the point-centred quarter method. On average, 313 plants ha-1 were recorded, belonging to 57 different species from 25 families. Timber species of commercial value represented 64% of all woody species and 36% of all woody plants. Nectandra megapotamica and Apuleia leiocarpa were the main dominant species. Twenty percent of all plants showed a DBH greater than 40 cm, representing 67% of the total log volume. Differences in species diversity and plant density among the forest remnants were detected. The few forest remnants represent an enormous richness of timber species, being the maintainers and propagule repository for all the biodiversity of that ecosystem. A knowledge-based forest management plan is therefore required to secure their vital role in forest enrichment programs or in projects aiming at recovering abandoned and degraded areas, and in breeding programs for the timber production improvement. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The objective of this research was to analyse RADARSAT images for forest types and land cover classification. Image processing techniques used to enhance RADARSAT images and forest types discrimination are presented. An area including the Tapajós National Forest and its immediate surroundings, located in Pará State, Brazil, was chosen for this investigation. The area to the east of the national forest is comprised of numerous small agricultural plots and abandoned areas with early secondary successional forest while the national forest itself is mainly undisturbed primary forest. RADARSAT standard and fine mode images were used in this study. Generally, the RADARSAT standard mode images showed good association with an existing vegetation map as characterized primarily by topographic features. Also, these images show recent clear cut areas, especially the S7D image which has a high incidence angle. Several other image enhancement techniques were applied to the RADARSAT data for land cover assessment. For a more detailed analysis, the same methodological approach was applied to the RADARSAT fine mode images acquired over a small portion of the Tapajós National Forest. RADARSAT data present much more information through visual inspection than one can attain by using digital classification algorithms that are based on per-pixel classifications. This study shows the potential of RADARSAT (standard and fine mode) images for refining the vegetation cover type classification and for updating the land cover class boundaries of an existing vegetation map. © 1998, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The economy of the northern Bolivian Amazon has historically been based on rubber and other non-timber forest products (NTFPs). In the late 19th century, the upcoming rubber boom lead to the establishment of rubber estates. Following World War I, a first rubber crisis forced some estate owners to abandon their land, favouring the emergence of independent communities. A second rubber crisis after World War II, along with the Agrarian Reform in 1953, accelerated the disintegration of rubber estates and the foundation of independent communities. In the early 1990s, the conclusive halt of Bolivian rubber production fuelled rural-urban migration and the differentiation of rural settlements. This paper examines the evolution from pure rubber estates to a wide array of settlement types. A settlement typology distinguishes four types of estates and six types of independent communities with varying trade-offs between extractivism and peasant agriculture. The findings have important implications for NTFP-based development. First, extraction-based livelihoods are socially acceptable only when access to basic services, like schooling, health care, and transportation is ensured. Second, in the region's remote areas the supply of such services needs to rely on a forest concession system within which the private sector bears the investments needed. Finally, indigenous communities participating in NTFP trade need to demarcate their sphere in between the remote forest concessions and the non-tribal peasantry in the vicinity of town.

AB  - Two pioneer woody plant species with differential growth habits, Cecropla latiloba and Senna reticulata, form monospecific stands during secondary succession in Amazonian floodplains. The 'fugitive strategy' of Cecropia latiloba enables vertical evasion from competition by continuous height growth without branching. This establishment strategy is aided by high submergence tolerance. In contrast to this, the 'possessive' Senna reticulata shows fast height growth only in the first non-flooded period, with extreme lateral branching and effective shading of competitors. This strategy is efficient only on higher elevations in the flooding gradient where complete submergence does not occur and on sites with supposedly high nutrient availability. The present study describes the two establishment strategies for floodplain pioneers based on structural, physiological and reproductive characteristics of the two species, measured in the lower Rio Solimões/Amazon River, Brazil, and in experiments performed at the INPA (Amazon Research Institute, Manaus). Despite several traits shared by the two species (many small seeds, high germination rates, high CO2-assimilation, fast initial growth, low maximum age, wood with high increments and low density), most physiognomic, structural and reproductive traits indicate two distinct establishment strategies which represent two extremes within a continuum of possible growth habits, and emphasize that also in ecosystems which have adverse growth conditions with prolonged flooding of up to 230 days every year and a water column of more than 10 m, the guild of pioneer trees does not necessarily form a homogeneous group.

AB  - Analysis of remotely sensed data at the level of individual farm properties provides additional insights to those derived from a landscape approach. Property-level analysis was carried out by overlaying a property boundary grid in a GIS. Data were derived from aerial photographs for 1970 and 1978 and Landsat Thematic Mapper images for 1985, 1988, and 1991. The study area contains approximately 3,800 properties, but this paper is based on a subset of 398 properties in the Brazilian Amazon. Analysis at the property level found patterns of land-cover classes that reflect differences in farming strategies of households. Data analysis at the household level was useful in explaining apparent mature forest to advanced secondary succession degradation in three years, not readily apparent from landscape analysis of remotely sensed data. The change was due to property-specific selective logging and the spread of fire from pastures into the adjacent forest.

AB  - Leaf-cutting ants (Atta spp.) often increase in abundance following deforestation and may have an important effect on forest succession on abandoned land. In this study, we evaluated the effects of leaf-cutting ant (Atta sexdens) activity on physical and chemical properties of soil, root distribution, and tree growth in a 17-yr-old secondary forest in eastern Amazonia, Brazil. We compared the soil properties and root distribution in shafts excavated into five mature nests and at 15 m distanced from each nest mound. We evaluated the nest effects on vegetation measuring the stem diameter growth of nine tree species and predawn leaf water potential of the tree species, Banara guianensis, along a gradient of increasing distance from the nest mounds. The growth of seedlings (Cecropia sp.) in pots containing different proportions of mineral soil and organic matter removed from nest refuse chambers was also compared. The deep soil beneath A. sexdens nests at different depths (100, 200, and 300 cm) presented a low (fivefold, P < 0.01) resistance to penetration and was rich in Ca (three- to fourfold, P = 0.06-0.02), K (7-14-fold, P < 0.05), and Mg (two- to threefold, P = 0.09 for 200 cm depth) when compared to non-nest soil. These changes in nest soil properties were accompanied by increases in coarse root biomass (>2 mm diameter, three- to fourfold) and fine root biomass (<2 mm, 10-50 fold). However, stem diameter growth was generally not affected by distance from the nest. The growth of Cecropia sp. seedlings in a pot experiment was favored by the addition of organic matter from the refuse chambers. Banara guianensis trees experienced greater water stress (low predawn water potential) close to the nest mound, perhaps indicating increased competition for soil water that may have accompanied the proliferation of roots of several species in the nest. The competing Atta effects of defoliation vs. deep soil tillage and nutrient enrichment upon secondary forest growth are difficult to compare. Atta's modification of soil physical and chemical properties point to its potential role in facilitating the rapid recovery of deep root systems and soil water uptake previously observed in this secondary forest.

AB  - The economy of the northern Bolivian Amazon has historically been based on rubber and other non-timber forest products (NTFPs). In the late 19th century, the upcoming rubber boom lead to the establishment of rubber estates. Following World War I, a first rubber crisis forced some estate owners to abandon their land, favouring the emergence of independent communities. A second rubber crisis after World War II, along with the Agrarian Reform in 1953, accelerated the disintegration of rubber estates and the foundation of independent communities. In the early 1990s, the conclusive halt of Bolivian rubber production fuelled rural-urban migration and the differentiation of rural settlements. This paper examines the evolution from pure rubber estates to a wide array of settlement types. A settlement typology distinguishes four types of estates and six types of independent communities with varying trade-offs between extractivism and peasant agriculture. The findings have important implications for NTFP-based development. First, extraction-based livelihoods are socially acceptable only when access to basic services, like schooling, health care, and transportation is ensured. Second, in the region's remote areas the supply of such services needs to rely on a forest concession system within which the private sector bears the investments needed. Finally, indigenous communities participating in NTFP trade need to demarcate their sphere in between the remote forest concessions and the non-tribal peasantry in the vicinity of town.

AB  - Forest structure and floristic composition were studied in a series of 0.5 ha natural forest plots at four sites near Porto Trombetas in Pará State, Brazil, 11-12 years after being subjected to differing levels of above-ground biomass harvest and removal. In addition to undisturbed control plots, experimental treatments included: removal of most trees ≥45 cm DBH (low intensity harvest); removal of trees <20 and ≥60 cm DBH (moderate intensity harvest); clear-cutting (100% above-ground biomass removal). Post-harvest basal area growth generally increased with harvest intensity, and total basal areas for trees ≥5 cm DBH were, at the time of our study, 60% (in the clear-cut) to about 80% of those in the control plots. Biomass harvests stimulated recruitment and growth of residual trees, particularly in the smaller diameter classes, but had little effect on species richness for small trees, seedlings, vine, herbs, and grasses. Species richness for trees ≥15 cm DBH was greater in the control and low-intensity (74-75 species) than in the moderate intensity (47 species) and clear-cut (26 species) treatment plots. While the tree flora within all harvest treatments was broadly similar to the undisturbed (control) plots and included similar numbers of species of the major plant families typical of the surrounding forests, the more intensive harvest treatments, especially the clear-cut, were dominated by a higher proportion of short-lived, early successional tree species. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - Development activities in Altamira, Para, Brazil began with the construction of the Transamazon Highway in 1970. In the early years land use emphasized annual crops, followed by pasture development. During the second decade of settlement, land cover in the region shifted from 'degraded pastures' or early stages of secondary successional vegetation to increased dominance of intermediate and late secondary succession. This finding is a result of recent research using Landsat TM satellite data and detailed field studies of vegetation stand structure. Close to 40% of the forest had been removed by 1985, but between 1985 and 1991 there is clear evidence for twice as much regrowth as there is new deforestation. Land use has a significant effect on the vegetation's total height, stem height, and basal area. The use of satellite data in combination with detailed studies of vegetation stand structure and land use histories gathered from households provide a multilevel approach that allows integration of local, regional, and global patterns of secondary succession in agricultural areas, and informs restoration strategies for Amazonia.

AB  - The Amazon Basin has suffered extensive deforestation in the past 30 years. Deforestation typically leads to changes in climate, biodiversity, hydrological cycle, and soil degradation. Vegetation succession plays an important role in soil restoration through accumulation of vegetation biomass and improved soil/plant interaction. However, relationships between succession and soil properties are not well known. For example, how does vegetation succession affect nutrient accumulation? Which soil factors are important in influencing vegetation growth? What is the best way to evaluate soil fertility in the Amazon basin? This paper focuses on the interrelationships between secondary succession and soil properties. Field soil sample data and vegetation inventory data were collected in two regions of Brazilian Amazonia (Altamira and Bragantina). Soil nutrients and texture were analyzed at successional forest sites. Multiple regression models were used to identify the important soil properties affecting vegetation growth, and a soil evaluation factor (SEF) was developed for evaluating soil fertility in Alfisols, Ultisols, and Oxisols, which differ in the ways they affect vegetation growth. For example, the upper 40 cm of soil is most important for vegetation growth in Alfisols, but in Ultisols and Oxisols deeper horizons significantly influence vegetation growth rates. Accumulation of vegetation biomass increased soil fertility and improved soil physical structure in Alfisols but did not completely compensate for the nutrient losses in Ultisols and Oxisols; however, it significantly reduced the rate of nutrient loss.

AB  - Scientific and public attention concerned with natural rubber (Hevea brasiliensis) production in the Amazon has focused on the high-tech practice of double-grafted, leaf blight resistant and high-yielding rubber clones on the one hand, and the low-tech practice of extractive use of natural rubber stands on the other. The intermediate, traditional practice of enriching slash-and-bum plots with rubber trees and managing them in a secondary forest environment, in association with other timber and non-timber species, has largely been overlooked. We present results from a survey of 51 farmer families conducted on the eastern bank of the Tapajós river in the central Brazilian Amazon, focusing on the population zone of the Tapajós National Forest and its northern vicinity. Actively managed rubber agroforests were most common on the sandy river banks and on humus- and clay-rich and ferralitic soils near the edge of the plateau at a few kilometers from the river. There was a gradient in management intensity between the proximity of the villages at the river, where rubber was often a component of homegardens, and the distant groves on the plateau, which often resembled secondary forests. The spatial separation of access to water at the river and more fertile soils on the plateau, the historical practice of abandoning the rubber groves at times of low rubber prices, and a substantial risk of losing plantations to abiotic and biotic threats, especially fire, are identified as factors that have presumably favored the development of agroforests with low management intensity in the region. Although about half of the interviewed farmers expressed a preference for weeded plantations, almost 90% of them extracted vegetal products other than rubber from the agroforests or used them as hunting grounds, and 80% believed that associated vegetation had no negative influence on rubber yields. The often good health of old rubber trees in Amazonian agroforests is explained with lower pressure from root rots, the periodic abandonment and especially a tapping technique that is well adapted to a moist forest environment. © 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - This work was carried out at Viçosa (20º45’S, 42º07’W) in the Southeastern region of Minas Gerais. The study examed the changes occurred in the stand between surveys done in 1984 and 1998. Species were then classified as pioneers, early secondary and late secondary. Changes in diametric distribution and absolute density were also investigated. Means were compared through student’s t and square-chi (χ2) tests. The stand showed to be constituted of nine pioneers, 56 early secondary, and 29 late secondary. Except for Plinia glomerata Berg.) Amshoff and Sorocea bonplandii (Daill.) Burger. Lanjow & Boer, no increase in absolute density could be detected for the individuals from the group of early secondary. The same trend was observed with in the pioneer species, without exceptions. These findings point out a tendency for decreasing importance of these ecological groups. Protium warmingianum March., the only late secondary to be analyzed, showed a significant increase in its absolute density. Overall, these facts suggested an improvement in the conditions of the area for the support of more advanced ecological groups in the successional scale. © 2017, Sociedade Botanica do Brasil.

AB  - The floristic composition and structure of vegetation in natural regeneration were studied in a degraded area in Matupá County, Mato Grosso State, Brazil, originally occupied by Tropical Rain Forest. Three plots were used in the shape of a 20m x 160m transect, divided into 10m x 20m sub-plots, placed parallel to a remnant fragment. Transect 1 was 0-20m from the fragment; Transect 2, 20-40m, and Transect 3, 40-60m from the forest fragment. The total height and diameter at soil height of all the shrubs and tree individuals (height≥0.50m) were measured to the 5, 13 and 18 months after the area had been systematized and abandoned. Floristic and structural alterations occurred in space and time. The number of individuals, species, families and diversity increased during the time interval studied and decreased with distance from the remnant fragment. These floristic and structural alterations in the community as a whole and in the populations of the most important species, Trema micrantha (L.) Blume and Schizolobium amazonicum Huber ex Ducke, showed the tendency of a succession model by facilitation, where these pioneers would be improving the ecological conditions and thus easing the regeneration of late species. The conservation of the forest fragment in the surroundings was essential for the natural regeneration process of the forest in the degraded area. © 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The temporal evolution of L-band microwave backscatter for several land cover types in the Tapajós natioanal Forest is analysed using JERS-1. Five images were acquired from 1993 to 1997. Samples of the studied land cover types were identified after analysis of a Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) dataset of 12 images obtained from 1984 to 1999. The following land cover types were investigated: bare soil, agriculture, pastures, forest regrowth from 1 to 23-years-old and primary forest. Backscatter behavior of regrowth stands is influenced by the previous land use and by human impacts such as fire and selective logging. This selective logging can be mechanized or not, because people who live in the Amazon usually cut trees to build houses, bridges, fences, etc. Backscatter of young regrowth stands on sites immediately abandoned after slash and burn increases at a faster rate than young regrowth on sites abandoned after some years of agriculture. Backscatter of old regrowth stands also behaves differently where there are disturbances such as fire or selective logging. In the presence of such disturbances, one finds an oscillating pattern over time, while undisturbed forest shows either a progressive trend or a stable pattern, depending on the age of the stand.

AB  - Conversion of tropical forests into pastures and agriculture have serious impacts on carbon allocation in ecosystems and releases carbon to the atmosphere, mainly as CO2 and CH4. The abandonment of these land uses typically results in secondary forest growth which can serve as a sink for carbon. To determine the relative importance of this sink for the western portion of Brazil's arc of deforestation in Acre State, we measured the aboveground biomass of six secondary forests (51 to 136 Mg/ha) with ages ranging from 6 to 35 years. Based on a negative exponential model, the biomass accumulation into secondary forests in Acre is approximately 6.2*e-0.0251 Mg ha-1 yr-1, of which approximately 50 percent is carbon. This simple model underestimates rates during the first ten years, but demonstrates the decreasing rate of carbon uptake with time, consistent with the classical pattern of secondary succession where slower growing tree species replace fast growing pioneer species. The time necessary to achieve half of primary forest biomass is about 30 years. Recent estimates of deforestation of Acre range between 40,000 and 50,000 ha yr-1. For secondary forests to compensate for the carbon loss from deforestation, 80,000 to 100,000 ha would need to be abandoned each year and left to accumulate carbon for 30 years. Pilot studies indicate that secondary forests are not increasing but rather decreasing in area in Acre. Consequently, secondary forests in Acre are insignificant sinks of carbon at present.

AB  - Commercial exploitation of non-timber forest products has been playing a major role in the northern Bolivian Amazon for more than a century. Initially relying on the exploitation of rubber, the regional economy underwent a first diversification as a consequence of the post-World War 1 rubber crisis: rubber tapping became supplemented with subsistence agriculture and Brazil nut extraction. This mode of making one's living prevailed in the region for several decades until Bolivian rubber trade came to a standstill in the early 1990s. The recent rubber crisis called again for substantial modifications of the regional economy. This paper examines the conversion from a rubber-based economy into production modes making broader use of forest resources. A village-level survey conducted in 163 rural settlements gave evidence that increased commercialization of Brazil nuts, palm hearts, and timber largely offset progressively lower incomes from rubber exploitation. In addition subsistence and market-oriented agriculture were expanded. Palm heart and timber extraction is likely to exceed natural regeneration rates, and therefore socio-economic needs and ecological requirements are yet to be reconciled in the post-rubber era of the northern Bolivian Amazon.

AB  - Land tenure has been considered one of the key factors that define patterns and change in land-use systems. This paper examines the implications of land reform for household decisions regarding patterns of land use, agricultural intensification, and forest conservation. We look at an Amazonian caboclo settlement in the Lower Amazon that had experienced land reform by the end of the 1980s. Results show that defined land tenure is not enough to guarantee agricultural intensification and forest conservation. In fact, several factors working at different scales are affecting land-use change in the region. At the settlement level, privatization of upland forest has led to an overall increase in cultivated land-pasture and annual crops-and increasing deforestation rates. However, at the farm-property level, different systems of agricultural production-intensive, extensive, or abandonment of land-occur according to availability of labor, and capital, and access to different natural resources.

AB  - A time-series of Landsat and SPOT sensor data was used to approximate the age of tropical forests regenerating on abandoned agricultural land north of Manaus, Brazil, and to estimate the period of active land use prior to abandonment. Based on field data, two distinct regeneration pathways, dominated by the pioneer genera Cecropia and Vismia, respectively, were described, with the former regenerating on the least intensively used sites. Forests of mixed species composition and lacking numerical dominance by pioneer species were also observed. Transformed Divergence Analysis of Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) radiance data revealed that forests of varying age and following different regeneration pathways were best discriminated using mid infrared (1.55-1.74 μm) wavelengths. As rates of carbon sequestration by forests vary with age and regeneration pathway, the potential exists for refining spatial estimates of the carbon balance of tropical forests regenerating on abandoned agricultural lands.

AB  - Estimating the contribution of deforestation to greenhouse gas emissions requires calculations of the uptake of carbon by the vegetation that replaces the forest, as well as the emissions from burning and decay of forest biomass and from altered emissions and uptakes by the soil. The role of regeneration in offsetting emissions from deforestation in the Brazilian Legal Amazon has sometimes been exaggerated. Unlike many other tropical areas, cattle pasture (rather than shifting cultivation) usually replaces forest in Brazilian Amazonia. Degraded cattle pastures regenerate secondary forests more slowly than do fallows in shifting cultivation systems, leading to lower uptake of carbon. The calculations presented here indicate that in 1990 the 410 × 103 km2 deforested landscape was taking up 29 × 106 t of carbon (C) annually (0.7 t C ha-1 year-1). This does not include the emissions from clearing of secondary forests, which in 1990 released an estimated 27 × 106 t C, almost completely offsetting the uptake from the landscape. Were the present land-use change processes to continue, carbon uptake would rise to 365 × 106 t annually (0.9 t C ha-1 year-1) in 2090 in the 3.9 × 106 km2 area that would have been deforested by that year. The 1990 rate of emissions from deforestation in the region greatly exceeded the uptake from regrowth of replacement vegetation. © 1996 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - We summarize early research on land-cover, land-use, and biophysical properties of vegetation from the Large Scale Biosphere Atmosphere (LBA) experiment in Amazônia. LBA is an international research program developed to evaluate regional function and to determine how land-use and climate modify biological, chemical and physical processes there. Remote sensing has played a fundamental role in LBA in research planning, land-cover mapping and in long-term monitoring of changes in land-cover and land-use at multiple scales. This special issue includes 12 papers that cover a range in spatial scales from regional mapping to local scales that cover only a portion of a Landsat scene. Several themes dominate, including land-cover mapping with an emphasis on wetlands and second-growth forest, evaluation of pasture sustainability and forest degradation and the impact of land-cover change on stream chemistry. New techniques introduced include automated Monte Carlo unmixing (AutoMCU) and several new approaches for mapping land-cover. A diversity of sensors are utilized, including ETM+, IKONOS, SPOT-4, Airborne P-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR), and L-band SAR. Census data are fused with an existing land-cover map to generate spatially explicit estimates of land-use from historical data. Several papers include important, new field measures of species composition, forest structure and biomass in mature forest and secondary succession. © 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - The objective of the present work was to study the structure of a stand of Submontane Semi-deciduous Forest, in Rio Doce State Park (19°29’-19°48’S e 42°28’-42°38’W). In order to sample the tree component, the point-centered-quarter method was employed according to two different protocols: in one including the dead individuals, and in the other excluding them. A total of 200 sampling points were allocated in 20 parallel lines, along a hillside. A total of 143 species, belonging to 109 recognized genera and 38 botanical families was found. The main species were Bixa arborea, Guatteria schomburgkiana, Joannesia princeps, Aparisthmium cordatum, Pseudopiptadenia contorta and Carpotroche brasiliensis. The size of the populations and their distribution throughout the environment determined the prominence of these species, with the exception of P. contorta, which was represented by few large individuals. The diameter and height distributions evidenced few individuals of great size, a fact probably linked to a history of burning a 1967. The fire history and the low occurrence of climax species suggest that the forest stand studied is in a medium stage of secondary succession. © 2002, Sociedade Botanica do Brasil.

AB  - A Landsat TM scene from July, 1991 was analyzed for an area of the Amazon estuary in Ponta de Pedras, Marajo Island, Brazil. Distinctive spectral signatures were determined for 14 land-cover classes, including upland and floodplain forest, three stages of secondary succession, palm forest, mangrove, pasture, and three types of savanna. Image classification (unsupervised and supervised using a hybrid maximum-likelihood/texture algorithm) of the study area was conducted using the 14 class spectral statistics inforined by 1992 vegetation inventories and field studies documenting historical land use. The use of field-based information supportive of classification resulted in individual test field class results which ranged from 81 to 100 percent individual class accuracy. Historically, attainment of good accuracy for many of these classes using satellite data has been difficult, but this research indicates suitable accuracy can be obtained using TM data when carefully integrated with detailed ground surveys. Elements of the classification were focused on addressing the difficult problem of identifying the conversion of "natural" to "managed" floodplain forest. The combination of feature classification using computer-analyzed TM data in conjunction with detailed ground measurements/surveys permitted identification of subtle changes in natural forest that was associated with conversion to managed floodplain forest.

AB  - We studied the conditions that permit the shrub, Cordia multispicata, to establish in Amazon pastures and the potential role of this shrub as a 'succession facilitator' near the town of Paragominas, Pará State, Brazil. Local disturbances that reduce cover such as grazing and burning helped C. multispicata establish in pastures in active use. Germination of C. multispicata was significantly improved on sites subjected to simulated grazing and seedling growth was hastened following pasture burning. We found that below-ground competition, evaluated using root ingrowth cores, was reduced by burning and grazing. Recently abandoned pastures are frequently composed of a mix of forbs and grasses but as succession proceeds a mosaic of more discrete vegetation patches appears. At our site, a five-year-old abandoned pasture, grass patches (primarily Panicum maximum) and shrub patches (mainly C. multispicata) were common. We compared physical and biotic characteristics of zones dominated by C. multispicata and P. maximum and found: (1) the rain of bat and bird dispersed seeds of woody species was much greater in the zones of C. multispicata (92 seeds/m2/year) than in the patches of grass (6 seeds/m2/year); (2) the density of woody seedlings was eight times greater in the C. multispicata patches (0.65/m2) than in the zones of P. maximum (0.08 woody individuals/m2); (3) soil nutrient availability and litter nutrient concentrations were greater in the shrub zones than in the grass zones; and (4) photosynthetic photon flux density at the soil surface was generally more favorable for rainforest tree seedling growth in C. multispicata patches (16% of full sunlight) as compared to the grass zones (7.7% of full sun). We conclude that the shrub, C. multispicata, acts as a magnet, attracting volant seed vectors, and as a nurse plant, facilitating the establishment of woody species in abandoned Amazon pastures. © 1994 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

AB  - The distribution of sources and sinks of carbon among the world's ecosystems is uncertain. Some analyses show northern mid-latitude lands to be a large sink, whereas the tropics are a net source; other analyses show the tropics to be nearly neutral, whereas northern mid-latitudes are a small sink. Here we show that the annual flux of carbon from deforestation and abandonment of agricultural lands in the Brazilian Amazon was a source of about 0.2 Pg C yr-1 over the period 1989-1998 (1 Pg is 1015 g). This estimate is based on annual rates of deforestation and spatially detailed estimates of deforestation, regrowing forests and biomass. Logging may add another 5-10% to this estimate, and fires may double the magnitude of the source in years following a drought. The annual source of carbon from land- use change and fire approximately offsets the sink calculated for natural ecosystems in the region. Thus this large area of tropical forest is nearly balanced with respect to carbon, but has an interannual variability of ± 0.2 PgC yr-1.

AB  - Research on secondary succession in the Amazon basin has attracted great interest in recent years. However, methods used to classify successional stages are limited. This research explores a method that can be used to differentiate regrowth stages. The vegetation inventory data were collected in Altamira, Bragantina, Pedras, and Tome-Acu of the eastern Amazon basin. A nested sampling strategy, organized by region, site, plot, and subplot, was employed for field data collection. Above-ground biomass (AGB), forest stand volume (FSV), basal area, average stand height, average stand diameter (ASD), age, ratio of tree biomass to total biomass (RTB), ratio of tree volume to total volume, and ratio of tree basal area to total basal area were calculated at the site level. Canonical discriminant analysis (CDA) was used to differentiate successional stages and to identify the best forest stand parameters to distinguish these stages. This research indicates that the CDA approach can be used to classify successional forest stages, but using RTB or a combination of two stand parameters such as AGB and ASD are more feasible and recommended in practice. © 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - Carbon stocks in vegetation replacing forest in Brazilian Amazonia affect net emissions of greenhouse gases from land-use change. A Markov matrix of annual transition probabilities was constructed to estimate landscape composition in 1990 and to project future changes, assuming behavior of farmers and ranchers remains unchanged. The estimated 1990 landscape was 5.4% farmland, 44.8% productive pasture, 2.2% degraded pasture, 2.1% 'young' (1970 or later) secondary forest derived from agriculture, 28.1% 'young' secondary forest derived from pasture, and 17.4% 'old' (pre-1970) secondary forest. The landscape would eventually approach an equilibrium of 4.0% farmland, 43.8% productive pasture, 5.2% degraded pasture, 2.0% secondary forest derived from agriculture, and 44.9% secondary forest derived from pasture. An insignificant amount is regenerated 'forest' (defined as secondary forest over 100 years old). Average total biomass (dry matter, including below-ground and dead components) was 43.5 t ha-1 in 1990 in the 410 × 103 km2 deforested by that year for uses other than hydroelectric dams. At equilibrium, average biomass would be 28.5 t ha-1 over all deforested areas (excluding dams). These biomass values are more than double those forming the basis of deforestation emission estimates currently used by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Although higher replacement landscape biomass decreases net emissions from deforestation, these estimates still imply large net releases. © 1996 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Aboveground biomass in cattle pasture converted from tropical dense forest was studied both before and after reburning in Brazilian Amazonia. In a 7-year-old pasture studied in Apiaú, Roraima, the aboveground dry weight of biomass (live plus dead) exposed to burning consisted of 96.3 t ha-1 of original forest remains, 6.2 t ha-1 of secondary successional vegetation (woody invaders in the pasture), and 8.0 t ha-1 of pasture grass (carbon contents 48.2%, 45.4%, and 42.2%, respectively). In terms of carbon, burning efficiencies for these three categories were 13.2%, 66.7% and 94.6%, respectively. Net charcoal formation was 0.35 t C ha-1 or 0.63% of the carbon exposed to the reburn, while the total accumulated since conversion (including the initial burn) is estimated at 2.3 t ha-1 (1.82% of the predeforestation aboveground biomass carbon stock). The dynamics of the original forest remains were represented in simulations that included parameters such as charcoal formation, burning efficiency and carbon concentration in different biomass components. Releases from initial burning of the cleared forest (44.0 t C ha-1) plus releases over the course of the succeeding decade through combustion (12.5 t C ha-1) and decay (51.5 t C ha-1) total 92% of the original forest biomass carbon (126 t C ha-1). Of biomass carbon remaining after the initial burn (84.3 t C ha-1), 76.0% is released: 61.1% through decay and 14.9% through combustion in reburns, while 1.2% is net conversion to charcoal in the reburns. These results indicate an amount of charcoal accumulation that is smaller than some carbon calculations have assumed, therefore suggesting a greater impact on global warming from conversion of forest to pasture.

AB  - In the Brazilian Amazon region, millions of hectares of forest land have been converted into cattle pastures and then been abandoned. Agroforestry is a potential option for the transformation of in parts degraded lands into productive agricultural systems. The re-establishment of a diversified soil macrofauna can help in the process of recuperation of the often compacted soil structure of the pastures. The soil macrofauna community was studied during the rainy season in four different agroforestry systems near Manaus in Central Amazonia: 1. a high-input silvopastoral system (ASPh), 2. a low-input silvopastoral system (ASPI), 3. a palm based system with four tree crop species (AS1) and 4. a high-diversity tree crop system with ten tree crop species (AS2), plus a spontaneous fallow for comparison. The sampling method recommended by the Tropical Soil Biology and Fertility Programme was used. The highest diversity of fauna groups was observed in the ASPh and ASPI where trees were associated with the leguminous cover crop, Desrnodiurn ovalifoliurn. The cover crop exerted a favorable effect on the soil fauna presumably by maintaining the soil moist and shaded and providing litter as a substrate. Of the 15 soil fauna groups that were found in all systems, four were absent from AS1. Within the AS2 system a significantly greater density of the soil fauna was observed under peach palm (Bactris gasipaes) and cupuaçu (Theobroma grandiflorum) (3107 and 524 ind.m-2, respectively) than under the other three tree species. The soil under peach palm and cupuaçu also tended to have a higher number of soil fauna groups. In AS1, the soil under peach palm had a higher fauna density than the soil under cupuaçu, probably caused by the abundant residues of the heart of palm harvest on the soil. The earthworm biomass was particularly high in AS1. Under cupuaçu approximately 7 times more earthworms were found in AS1 (17.9) than in AS2 (2.4). The study of the macrofauna community, including both the litter layer and the superficial soil layers, allows to identify the plant species/management combinations which favour the increase of the diversity of the invertebrates.

AB  - Mortality and recruitment rates were obtained for tree species over a 5.6 year period in a 1-ha fragment of secondary montane rain forest in Southeastern Brazil. All plants with a diameter at breast height (dbh) > or = 8 cm were sampled in 1989-1990 and 1995. There was an increase from 90 to 96 species, and 669 ind./ha to 749 ind./ha over the period. The mortality rate of 1.67%/yr was similar to findings for other forests, while recruitment of 3.46%/yr was the highest rate reported. Both mortality and recruitment were significantly higher in the smaller dbh classes. Recruitment was higher among rare species, and the relatively slow-growing species had significantly higher mortality rates. Differences between species dynamics were marked. Species with high values of lambda were mainly early successional and understorey trees but some understorey species also suffered a marked population decline. The classification system of species in response to light which divides understorey species into "partial shade-bearers" and "shade-bearers" groups showed to be the most suitable to the obtained results. The results suggest that this forest is undergoing a process of recovery from past disturbance.

AB  - The region around Altamira, Brazil, located in the Eastern Amazon, has experienced rapid landcover change since the initiation of government sponsored colonization projects associated with the construction of the Trans-Amazon Highway. The 30 years since colonization (1971) have been marked by a net loss of forest cover and an increase in the amount of cultivated/productive land, particularly for pasture and annual/perennial crop production. This research presents a parcel-level model of landcover change for smallholders in the Altamira study area. The utility of specific land-use activities is calculated to identify those land-uses that are most optimal at each time point, and labor is allocated to these activities based on the availability of household and wage labor. The model reports the proportion of the parcel in the following landcover classes at each time point using a 1-year interval: mature forest, secondary successional forest, perennial crops, annual crops and pasture. A graphical user interface is used for scenario testing, such as the impact of high/low (population) fertility, the increase of out-migration to urban areas, or changes in cattle and crop prices. The model shows a rapid reduction in the amount of mature forest in the 30 years following initial settlement, after which the parcel is composed of a mosaic of secondary succession, pasture and crops. The nature and rapidity of this landcover change is the function of a variety of household and external variables incorporated in the model. In particular, the model produces different landcover compositions as a function of demographic rates (fertility, mortality) and agricultural prices. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - An analysis of the evolution of deforestation and secondary vegetation in abandoned areas in a region of Rondônia was based on classifications of 1985 and 1995 Landsat Thematic Mapper images. Secondary vegetation corresponded to 28% of the deforested area in both years. Deforested area and secondary vegetation were calculated for 2.5 km x 2.5 km cells. During the period of study, deforestation tended to increase in cells that showed the highest fractions of deforestation in 1985, particularly near the region's main road, where forest clearing may have exceeded frequently the 50% legal limits in force in 1995. The relative importance of secondary vegetation tended to decrease in cells with more deforestation and increased near the edge of the deforestation process, in newly settled areas. Concentration of deforestation and the concurrent decrease of secondary vegetation suggest a scenario of land use intensification based on pasture expansion, where abandonment and large patches of secondary vegetation become infrequent.

AB  - Floristic composition and vegetation structure of plants 3 cm stem diameter or greater were compared at four sites in the Agreste of Paraíba, Brazil: (1) little disturbed for five decades (LD); (2) grazed fragment, selectively logged 16 years before sampling (GF); (3) naturally regrowing for 30 years after 39 years of agricultute (OR); and (4) naturally regrowing for 20 years after 35 years of agriculture plus 15 years of pasture (NR). Cattle graze frequently in the last three sites but vety seldom in LD. The little disturbed site had more species (53) than the other three sites (36, 25, and 11 species in GF, OG, and NG, respectively) and also more (3253, 2780, 2780, and 2115 plants/ha) and larger plants (34.8, 26.8, 18.6, and 7.8 m 2/ha), including taller tree species (up to 15 m) absent in the other sites (maximum height: 14, 6, and 5 m). Differences were striking in relation to NR, the site with longer use and shorter regrowth period, which was strongly dominated by only two species: Mimosa tenuiflora (73% relative density and 81% basal area) and Piptadenia stipulacea (21% relative density and 16% basal area). These results indicate that abandoned agricultural sites may take several decades to reestablish vegetation similar to the original.

AB  - Fallow periods used in slash-and-burn agriculture in the Bragantina region, the oldest agricultural frontier in the Brazilian Amazon, are being reduced. The objective of this study was to analyze the effects of a shortened fallow period on the Bragantina landscape dynamics and equilibrium. Dynamics were characterized by landscape structural changes, particularly in the spatial distribution of secondary forests, and by transition matrix. Equilibrium was defined by temporal and spatial parameters, and by the increment of agricultural areas from 1985 to 1996, analyzed with 6 LANDSAT-TM images. I worked with 6 areas of 250 ha each, 3 with short fallow periods (2-4 years) and 3 with long fallow periods (about 10 years). Results showed that short fallow period areas did not present an equilibrium situation. In these areas, developed secondary vegetation tended to disappear and agricultural areas were being expanded at an average rate of 3% per year. Landscape structure changes pointed out that a reduction in fallow period was occurring in already short fallow period areas. Long fallow period areas presented a shifting mosaic steady-state condition, where punctual changes due to agricultural uses were compensated by field abandonment rate. Both agricultural uses and field abandonment rates were lower in long fallow period areas when compared with short ones. Comparisons with indigenous traditional cropping-fallow cycles indicate that sustainable conditions could be maintained with 11 years of fallow for each cropping year, while shorter cycles would break down the system if agricultural improvements are not implemented.

AB  - Soil fertility differed substantially among three neighboring sites representing different stages of a shifting cultivation cycle on a deeply weathered Oxisol on the Chapada de Araripe in the semiarid region of NE Brazil. Samples taken from a native thorn forest area (Caatinga), from a recently slashed and burnt area (Burnt) and from a site abandoned after five years of manual cultivation to cassava [Abandoned), were compared using subtractive and additive fertilization greenhouse trials and incubations for C and N mineralization. The effect of burning as to increase soil nutrient content relative to the Caatinga area samples. followed by decreases of N and organic P by 20%. available P by 70%. and exchangeable bases by 55%, on average, after abandonment. The unfertilized control of the missing-element trial gave the lowest dry matter (DM) yields, but still those of the Burnt were twice as large as those of the Abandoned area samples. The relative yield ratios were not changed by nutrient addition, although total yields were increased by a factor of 5. In all three areas, the most severe nutrient limitation was of P, followed by N. The N deficiency somewhat increased relative to P in the Abandoned samples. Addition of 25 mg P kg-1 soil produced 4 to 5-fold dry matter increases in the Caatinga and 7 to 8-fold increases in the Burnt area samples further increasing P. levels improved yields only marginally and only at high additions of N and K. In samples from the abandoned area 25 mg P kg-1 not even doubled the dry matter yield and no additional effects were observed for higher N and K rates Carbon mineralization during the 12 week incubation followed the order Caatinga > Abandoned > Burnt, whereas the order for N removed in 13 leachings was Caatinga > Burnt > Abandoned. Accordingly, organic matter mineralized from the abandoned soil had a higher C:N ratio. In addition to the nutrient limitations of this Oxisol, samples from the Abandoned area exhibited further limitations resulting in yield reductions, which were not explained by any of the factors examined. This indicates that alternatives to long-fallow shifting cultivation will require further refinement of methodologies to measure and predict soil quality.

AB  - The part of the Amazonian forest with the greatest rates of primary forest degradation is found in eastern Pará, in northern Brazil. This degradation is due to deforestation for pastures and timber harvest activities. Recently, large areas of pasture have been planted with the paricá tree, (Schizolobium amazonicum Huber ex Ducke), an Amazonian endemic. Here I examine the ecological importance of this landscape for the conservation of regional biological diversity. The bird community in the tree plantation comprised 36 species, of which only one can be considered a forest species. This number is less than that recorded for the other three dominant landscapes in the region: primary forests, secondary forests and abandoned pastures. Thus, these plantations attract relatively few forest bird species and, therefore, have little value compared to other areas for the conservation of regional biological diversity.

AB  - To test whether Brazil nut (Bertholletia excelsa) requires a specific canopy gap size in order to regenerate, 50 gaps of varying size (25-712 m2) and 20 understorey sites (each of 141 m2) were sampled in tropical moist forest at Riberalta, Bolivia. The density of Brazil nut seedlings (<1.30 m in height) and saplings (>1.30 m) was assessed at each site, and the light environment was determined using hemispherical photography to estimate the global site factor (GSF), which represents the proportion of total above canopy irradiance that is received below the canopy. Saplings only occurred in gaps >95 m2 or >10.4% GSF, whereas seedlings occurred throughout a range of gap sizes and in the forest understorey. Regression analysis showed a highly significant relationship between Brazil nut sapling density against both gap size and global site factor (GSF). These results may contribute to the development of plans for sustainable management of this species, by defining the appropriate canopy gap size required for the successful natural regeneration of Brazil nut.

AB  - As a large and dynamic land-use category, tropical secondary forests may affect climate, soils, and hydrology in a manner different from primary forests or agricultural areas. We investigated the saturated hydraulic conductivity Ksat of a Kandiudult under different land uses in Rondonia, Brazil. We measured Ksat at four depths (12.5, 20, 30 and 50 cm) under (a) primary forest, (b) a former banana-cacao plantation (SF1), and (c) an abandoned pasture (SF2). At 12.5 cm, all three land uses differ significantly (α = 0.1), but not at the 20 and 30 cm depths. At 50 cm, Ksat was significantly greater in the former pasture than in other land uses. Lateral subsurface flow is expected during intense rainfall (about 30 times per year) at 30 cm depth in SF1 and at 50 cm depth in the forest, whereas the relatively low permeability at shallow 12.5 cm in the SF2 may result not only in lateral subsurface flow, but also saturation overland flow. For modelling purposes, recovering systems seem to have Ksat values distinct from primary forest at shallow depths, whereas at deeper layers (>20 cm) they may be considered similar to forests.

AB  - Landscape forest flammability and regional biomass burning are critical environmental issues associated to fire use practices in the Brazilian Amazon. To better understand the gamut of these issues, all land use pathways that lead to fire use and culminate in different fire types must be investigated. An estimated 400,000 smallholders use fire in their land use practices, but most research has investigated connections between land use decisions and subsequent fire on large-scale cattle ranches only. This study presents research on smallholder fire use practices in the agricultural frontier south of Santarem, Para. Vegetation vulnerable to smallholder fires is largely secondary succession, while only ~8% is logged or mature forest cover. Fire efficiency in smallholder fire use practices is slightly higher than in previous studies used to estimate regional biomass burning, averaging 46.7-57.5%. In slashed succession areas, average efficiency also increases as biomass fuel load increases, but range increases as well, suggesting that smallholders may have more control over efficiency outcome in younger slashed succession areas than older slashed succession, logged areas or mature forests.

The flora was surveyed from January 1999 to January 2000. A number of 79 species was identified, distributed into 69 genera and 31 families. The families with the highest number of species were the Leguminosae (9), the Asteraceae (7), the Rubiaceae (7), the Bignoniaceae (6) and the Apocynaceae (5). The flora survey of trees and shrub species revealed the presence of 18 pioneer species, 16 early secondary, 18 late secondary and three uncharacterized species. The forest fragment is in a secondary succession stage.

AB  - In this paper we present a list of plant species whose fruits are eaten by eight cotinga species (Carpornis cucullatus, C. melanocephalus, Laniisoma elegans, Lipaugus lanioides, Oxyruncus cristatus, Phibalura flavirostris, Procnias nudicollis, and Pyroderus scutatus) at Parque Estadual Intervales (PEI), an Atlantic Forest reserve in southeast Brazil. Besides providing a list of fruits eaten by cotingas, our goal is to allow insights into fruit use by these birds whose ecology is poorly known. From 1990 to 2001 four sites located within PEI were regularly visited. These sites form an altitudinal gradient (70-800 m a.s.l.) and also a gradient of forest disturbance (second-growth to old-growth vegetation). Feeding records were made along several trails and dirt roads that crossed the study sites. Cotingas ate a variety of fruits (99 species in 34 families) that ranged from small (< 5 mm diameter) to large (up to 37 mm) and included some non-ornithochorous ones. With the exception of P. nudicollis, cotingas exploited not only fruits typical of the forest interior but also fruits of secondary vegetation, suggesting that concerning fruit exploitation early successional vegetation does not represent a barrier for the survival of these cotingas.

AB  - Regíonal climatic change, including significant reductions in Amazon Basin evaporation and precipitation, has been predicted by numerical simulations of total tropical forest removal. These results have been shown to be very sensitive to the prescription of the albedo shift associated with conversion from forest to a replacement land cover. Modelers have so far chosen to use an "impoverished grassland" scenario to represent the postforest land surface. This choice maximizes the shifts in land surface parameters, especially albedo (fraction of incident shortwave radiation reflected by the surface). Recent surveys show secondary vegetation to be the dominant land cover for some deforested areas of the Amazon. The characteristics of secondary vegetation as well as agricultural land covers other than pasture have received little attention from field scientists in the region. This paper presents the results of field measurements of radiation flux over various deforested surfaces on a small farm in the eastern Amazonian state of Para. The albedo of fields in active use was as high as 0.176, slightly less than the 0.180 recently determined for Amazonian pasture and substantially less than the 0.19 commonly used in GCM simulations of deforestation. For 10-yr-old secondary vegetation, albedo was 0.135, practically indistinguishable from the recently published mean primary forest albedo of 0.134. Measurements of surface temperature and net radiation show that, despite similarity in albedo, secondary vegetation differs from primary forest in energy and mass exchange. The elevation of midday surface temperature above air temperature was found to be greatest for actively and recently farmed land, declining with time since abandonment. Net radiation was correspondingly lower for fields in active or recent use. Using land cover analyses of the region surrounding the study area for 1984, 1988, and 1991, the pace of change in regional-mean albedo is estimated to have declined and appears to be leveling at a value less than 0.03 above that of the original forest cover.

AB  - Abundant vegetation species and associated complex forest stand structures in moist tropical regions often create difficulties in accurately classifying land-use and land-cover (LULC) features. This paper examines the value of spectral mixture analysis (SMA) using Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) data for improving LULC classification accuracy in a moist tropical area in Rondônia, Brazil. Different routines, such as constrained and unconstrained least-squares solutions, different numbers of endmembers, and minimum noise fraction transformation, were examined while implementing the SMA approach. A maximum likelihood classifier was also used to classify fraction images into seven LULC classes: mature forest, intermediate secondary succession, initial secondary succession, pasture, agricultural land, water, and bare land. The results of this study indicate that reducing correlation between image bands and using four endmembers improve classification accuracy. The overall classification accuracy was 86.6% for the seven LULC classes using the best SMA processing routine, which represents very good results for such a complex environment. The overall classification accuracy using a maximum likelihood approach was 81.4%. Another finding is that use of constrained or unconstrained solutions for unmixing the atmospherically corrected or raw Landsat TM images does not have significant influence on LULC classification performances when image endmembers are used in a SMA approach. © 2004 Taylor & Francis Ltd.

AB  - This article examines forest change in the Brazilian Amazon in light of forest transition theory. We draw on satellite-based land cover data matched in a geographic information system (GIS) to census-based social and agricultural data for Brazilian municipalities at multiple time points. Subregions with distinct settlement histories serve as proxies for different stages along the forest transition, theorized to exhibit depletionof forest cover, eventually followed by a recovery. Satellite images allow for distinctions between primary (old-growth) and secondary (successional) forests, but the data indicate more successional forests than expected. We argue that biophysical impediments (e.g., poor soils) and social obstacles (e.g., capital scarcity) led to limited land settlement, low incomes, urbanization, and a shift from crops to pasture, resulting in the rapidexpansion of secondary forests without primary forest depletion. These findings call for refinements in forest transition theory that can better account for land cover changes in tropical regions of non-OECD countries. © 2003 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - We describe spatiotemporal variation in land cover over 80,000 km2 in central Rondônia. We use a multistage process to map primary forest, pasture, second growth, urban, rock/savanna, and water using 33 Landsat scenes acquired over three contiguous areas between 1975 and 1999. Accuracy of the 1999 classified maps was assessed as exceeding 85% based on digital airborne videography. Rondônia is highly fragmented, in which forests outside of restricted areas consist of numerous, small irregular patches. Pastures in Rondônia persist over many years and are not typically abandoned to second growth, which when present rarely remains unchanged longer than 8 years. Within the state, annual deforestation rates, pasture area, and ratio of second growth to cleared area varied spatially. Highest initial deforestation rates occurred in the southeast (Luiza), at over 2%, increasing to 3% by the late 1990s. In this area, the percentage of cleared land in second growth averaged 18% and few pastures were abandoned. In central Rondônia (Ji-Paraná), deforestation rates rose from 1.2% between 1978 and 1986 to a high of 4.2% in 1999. In the northwest (Ariquemes), initial deforestation rates were lowest at 0.5% but rose substantially in the late 1990s, peaking at 3% in 1998. The ratio of second growth to cleared area was more than double the ratio in Luiza and few pastures remained unchanged beyond 8 years. Land clearing was most intense close to the major highway, BR364, except in Ariquemes. Intense forest clearing extended at least 50 km along the margins of BR364 in Ji-Paraná and Luiza. Spatial differences in land use are hypothesized to result from a combination of economic factors and soil fertility. Copyright 2002 by the American Geophysical Union.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to assess the potential of estimating the area, age and changes of tropical secondary forest regrowth from the Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM). Sites of mature forest, agriculture, pasture, pasture with remnant trees, and stands of secondary forest regrowth from 2 to 19 years of age were surveyed in two study areas near Manaus, Amazonas, Brazil, and mapped to the TM imagery. Considerable changes in spectral reflectance were observed over the first 19 years of regrowth, and these can be summarized by indices related to canopy brightness and greenness. The near-infrared reflectance, the difference index, Kauth-Thomas greenness, and percentage leaf cover all increase over the first 4 years after abandonment, peak from 4 to 8 years, and decrease from 8 to 13 years. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) rapidly rises over the first 4 years, and displays no apparent relation to stand age thereafter. The brightness of regrowth canopies decreases from 8 to 13 years. Stands from 13 to 19 years-old are spectrally similar to mature forest. All regrowth age classes are spectrally distinct from agriculture and pasture, and all regrowth age classes younger than 14 years are spectrally distinct from mature forest. Spectral indices of canopy brightness are significantly correlated with regrowth stand age (r 2≤0·48, p<0·001). Based on field research in several areas of Amazonia, these spectral patterns can be explained in terms of temporal changes in canopy geometry and leaf area. The estimated rates of regrowth clearance and reversion to regrowth between 1988 and 1991 suggest the intensity of rotational agriculture practised by both communities. These results suggest that monitoring tropical secondary regrowth with TM imagery could substantially improve estimates of carbon sequestration subsequent to tropical deforestation. © 1996, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - A study was carried out in order to obtain a quantitative description of the vegetation covering three hectares of "cerrado" (savanna) located in the Marflora holdings, municipality of Santa Quitéria, State of Maranhão, Brazil. Descriptive parameters were obtained from 1,413 trees with diameter at breast-height (dbh) larger than 5.0 cm and distributed within 41 species. The data obtained included wood volume, basal area and quantity of dry wood for the main stem and branches for each area and for every species. Average wood volume and weight were 40.50 m3/ha and 31.63 t/ha, respectively. A total of 3,177 individuals with dbh smaller than 5.0 cm was accounted for the natural regeneration in the whole area.

AB  - Understanding secondary successional processes in Amazonian terrestrial ecosystems is becoming increasingly important as continued deforestation expands the area that has become secondary forest, or at least has been through a recent phase of secondary forest growth. Most Amazonian soils are highly weathered and relatively nutrient poor, but the role of nutrients as a factor determining successional processes is unclear. Soils testing and chronosequence studies have yielded equivocal results regarding the possible role of nutrient limitation. The objective of this paper is to report the first two years' results of a nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) fertilization experiment in a 6-yr-old secondary forest growing on an abandoned cattle pasture on a clayey Oxisol. Growth of remnant grasses responded significantly to the N + P treatment, whereas tree biomass increased significantly following N-only and N + P treatments. The plants took up about 10% of the 50 kg P/ha of the first year's application, and recovery in soil fractions could account for the rest. The trees took up about 20% of the 100 kg N/ha of the first year's application. No changes in soil inorganic N, soil microbial biomass N, or litter decomposition rates have been observed so far, but soil faunal abundances increased in fertilized plots relative to the control in the second year of the study. A pulse of nitric oxide and nitrous oxide emissions was measured in the N-treated plots only shortly after the second year's application. Net N mineralization and net nitrification assays demonstrated strong immobilization potential, indicating that much of the N was probably retained in the large soil organic-N pool. Although P availability is low in these soils and may partially limit biomass growth, the most striking result of ' this study so far is the significant response of tree growth to N fertilization. Repeated fire and other losses of N from degraded pastures may render tree growth N limited in some young Amazonian forests. Changes in species composition and monitoring of long-term effects on biomass accumulation will be addressed as this experiment is continued.

AB  - Bromelia antiacantha is a terrestrial bromeliad, native of the Atlantic Forest, commonly used in the folk medicine by its anthelminthic and antitussive medicinal properties. This species is also used in the treatment of kidney stones. The species, a non-timber forest product, presents a potential for sustainable management. Thus, the understanding of ecology aspects related to the seeds germination could provide information about management strategies of natural population, germoplasm collection and domestication. In this work, it was studied the time variation in the germination of seeds of a B. antiacantha natural population. The experiment was carried out in controlled atmosphere, with seeds collected from 45 reproductive plants in Três Barras, SC / (IBAMA) National Forest, south Brazil. The analysis of variance of the percentage seeds germination in different dates indicated the existence of difference among the reproductive plants for all the analyzed times. These were more pronounced at 35 days after sowing. The data presented fitting to two different regression models. The germination rates obtained indicate differences in the time of germination between reproductive plants. Some reproductive plants needed less than 36 days to germinate 80% of their seeds, while others needed more than 72 days to obtain the same percentage of germination. Thus, B. antiacantha has an adapted strategy that makes possible a continuous and gradual entrance of its seedlings in its population. This strategy enlarges dispersion and natural regeneration possibilities of this species and has implication in the management of natural population, domestication and germoplasm conservation.

AB  - Restoring self-sustaining tropical forest ecosystems on surface mined sites is a formidable challenge that requires the integration of proven reclamation techniques and reforestation strategies appropriate to specific site conditions, including landscape biodiversity patterns. Restorationists working in most tropical settings are usually hampered by lack of basic information on the wide variety of native tree species that characterize the pre-disturbance forests, as well as insufficient understanding of the ecology of disturbance and natural recovery to design effective restoration programs. A notable exception to this is the forest restoration program developed since the early 1980s by a Brazilian bauxite mining company operating at Trombetas in Pará State in central Amazonia. A systematic nursery and field research strategy was used to develop a reforestation program based on mixed plantings of more than 70 native old-growth forest tree species. This technique has been used to replant about 100 ha of deforested minelands each year over the past 15 years. Research in recent years has evaluated this approach and other, generally simpler, reforestation methods used at a smaller scale at this site. Post-plantation biodiversity development and other indicators of restoration success or sustainability were recorded. The results of these studies have shown the overwhelming importance of careful site preparation and topsoil handling/replacement practices in determining both future productivity and biodiversity of the redeveloping forests, irrespective of the complexity of the planting design used. The inclusion of a wide variety of forest species, particularly later successional species, was very important for long-range restoration owing to limitations on natural recovery processes that inhibit seed dispersal and subsequent colonization of many old-growth forest species. Many of the lessons learned at this site are applicable to improve the design of mineland rehabilitation and forest restoration programs worldwide. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - Traditional Amazonian farmers (caboclos) along the Xingu River near Altamira, Para, Brazil, practice shifting cultivation using fallow periods (periods during which cultivated areas are temporarily abandoned and invaded by secondary forest) which they consider necessary to restore soil nutrients and control weeds and insect pests. At the end of the growing season, maize production was measured in the farmers' fields in randomly selected 9-m2 quadrats. Yield was significantly higher in agricultural plots derived from secondary forest (n = 11) than from old growth ('virgin') forest (n = 11). Yield on plots derived from mature secondary forest (11-30 yr old; n = 4) was also significantly higher than that on plots derived from young secondary forest (3-10 yr old; n = 7) and 'virgin' forest. A significant positive relationship was encountered between length of fallow period and maize yield over the range of fallow ages studied (3-30 yr).

AB  - This paper presents a dynamic systems model that shows how different land use patterns degrade the value of ecosystem services provided by the Brazilian Amazonia. The model consists of four sectors: (1) deforestation drivers; (2) land use/cover; (3) ecosystem services; and (4) ecosystem valuation. The deforestation drivers sector models the economic and social incentives that small farmers and large pasture investors have for clearing the forest. The land use/cover sector shows how these different groups clear land, and further shows how patterns of forest succession and associated biomass differ by primary land use type. Different land use patterns greatly impact the quality and economic value of ecosystem services. These impacts are dealt with in the ecosystem services sector, which models the region's hydrological cycle, the nutrient cycle, carbon sequestration capacity, and species diversity. Calculations are made in the ecosystem valuation sector according to a reference monetary value for these ecosystem services. The model calculates the change in these values according to the land use practices that occur over time. Findings show that over a 100-year simulation, forest area remains about 44% of original area with pasture and abandoned pasture becoming the dominant land cover. The value of ecosystem services declines from $1431 to $658 and $781 ha-1 year-1 for agriculture and pasture, respectively. These findings are compared to annual revenue derived from different land use practices for which land was cleared in the Brazilian Amazonia. In the context of these findings, the authors discuss how an explicit monetary valuation of ecosystem services could create positive incentives for land stewardship and conservation. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - The future flora of Amazonia will include significant areas of secondary forest as degraded pastures are abandoned and secondary succession proceeds. The rate at which secondary forests regain carbon (C) stocks and re-establish biogeochemical cycles that resemble those of primary forests will influence the biogeochemistry of the region. Most studies have focused on the effects of deforestation on biogeochemical cycles. In this study, we present data on the recuperation of carbon stocks and carbon fluxes within a secondary forest of the eastern Amazon, and we compare these measurements to those for primary forest, degraded pasture, and productive pasture. Along a transect from a 23-y-old degraded pasture, through a 7-y-old secondary forest, through a 16-year-old secondary forest, and to a primary forest, the δ13C values of soil organic matter (SOM) in the top 10 cm of soil were -21.0, -26.5, -27.4, and -27.9‰, respectively, indicating that the isotopic signature of SOM from C3 forest plants was rapidly re-established. The degraded pasture also had significant inputs of C from C3 plants. Radiocarbon data indicated that most of the C in the top 10 cm of soil had been fixed by plants during the last 30 years. Differences in soil C inventory among land use types were small compared to uncertainties in their measurement. Root inputs were nearly identical in primary and secondary forests, and litterfall in the secondary forest was 88% of the litterfall rate of the primary forest. In contrast, the secondary forest had only 17% of the above ground biomass. Because of rapid cycling rates of soil C and rapid recovery of C fluxes to and from the soil, the below ground C cycle in this secondary forest was nearly identical with those of the unaltered primary forest.

AB  - This paper examines the role of soil fertility and land-use history on the rates of forest successional regrowth in five regions of the Amazon Basin. Sites are located in the Bragantina Region, Tomé Açú Region, Altamira Region and Marajó Region of the State of Pará, Brazil and in a region of the Colombian Vaupés. Methods used included vegetation inventories of successional and mature forests, soil sampling, ethnographic assessment of land-use histories, and land cover classification based on multi-temporal Landsat Thematic Mapper digital satellite data. The paper examines inter-regional differences, intraregional differences, and Basin-wide differences in rates of forest regrowth. Inter-regional differences are best explained by the differences between areas in soil fertility, whereas intra-regional differences are best explained by the differential impact of land-use history on forest recovery. Basin-wide differences in rates of succession can best be captured by differences in tree height, and secondarily by differences in basal area. In inter-regional comparisons we found that ultisols, oxisols, and spodosols present similar rates of regrowth, but considerably slower rates when compared to alfisols. During the first 5-10 years of regrowth, alfisol areas have average stand height 1 m higher, and this difference doubles after 15 years of regrowth. In intra-regional comparisons, using one region as an example, we found that land-use differences are most able to explain differences. Areas that had been in swidden agriculture grew back at a rate of 1.5 m per year, as compared with 0.45 m per year for areas that had experienced mechanized land preparation, and 0.62 m per year for areas that had been in pasture. In Basin-wide comparisons we have been able to discriminate three distinct stages of secondary succession using structural criteria, across both soil and land-use types with height as the most predictive criteria of overall structural development. By comparing our five sites' data with that of other investigators, the paper proposes Basin-wide patterns of regrowth for each of three structural stages of secondary succession that facilitate linking the field vegetation data to remotely-sensed data of land cover. © 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - The State Park of Ilha Grande is only a part (5,594 hectares) of the entire island (19,300 hectares) which is located off the south coast of Rio de Janeiro state, between the cities of Mangaratiba and Angra dos Reis. Approximately half of the Park area (47%) is covered by dense Atlantic forest. The secondary forest growth is in a process of ecological succession close to attaining maturity (43%) and the remaining part (10%) is composed of human-altered areas (1%), rocky outcrops with herbaceous vegetation (7%), mangroves and beaches (2%). The fauna is well represented but already shows signs of degradation with introduced species. The analysis of the degree of threat has shown that the dense forest habitat has a relatively stable status of conservation while the secondary forest, the mangrove and the herbaceous vegetation on rocky outcrops (and their fauna) are categorized as vulnerable. The area altered by human occupation is considered threatened. Since the coastal area where Ilha Grande is located is well known for its beautiful scenery (known as the green coast, because of the contrast between the ocean and the Atlantic forest covering the Serra do Mar mountain chain). There is a strong possibility for tourism to become the means in which to achieve economic sustainability for conservation. Contradictorily, tourism is also the major threat to local biodiversity and its landscape units. Because tourism is not organized and controlled, during high season the numbers grow above local capacity, giving rise to a proliferation of hotels, guesthouses and camping grounds. The resulting untreated open sewage, random garbage disposal and other harmful activities form the major threats to biodiversity.

AB  - Composition, structure and dynamics of an eight year old secondary forest was studied at Réserva Volta Velha (26°04'S; 48'38'W), southern Brazil. A 0,72haplot was divided into 36 subplots of20X10m, where all trees/shrubs greater than 1m tall were identified, measured (height/diameter) and evaluated (successional status). The results were: (1) 95 species collected within 68 genera and 44 families; the most species rich families were Myrtaceae and Asteraceae with 8 species each; (2) the most important species (considering biomass and density) were Psidium cattleianum, Eupatorium casarettoi, Ocotea pulchella and Ternstroemia brasiliensis; (3) the most similar area was a fallow abandoned 35 years ago; (4) the higher species diversity were found in border subplots, indicating that most of the species do not tolerate extreme conditions in the center of the opening, and are colonizing the area through the borders.

AB  - Both second-growth and agroforestry systems (AFs) have the potential for recovering thousands of abandoned pasturelands in Amazon. The AFs may do it faster and, at the same time, produce direct economic benefits for farmers. Improved nutrient recycling may be expected due to distinctive litter production in AFs, but lacks experimental data yet. The stocks of carbon and nutrients of the litter layer under different agroforestry systems (AFs) were investigated at an abandoned pasture site, 60 km north of Manaus. The experimental design consisted of three blocks, with five treatments: four different types of 5-year-old AFs and a secondary forest (CAP). Litter layer was sampled in the wet and dry seasons, sorted according to the predominant plant species and analysed for carbon and nutrient concentrations. The litter layer in the control plots was much larger than in the AFs, and thus, the carbon stocks in the litter layer of the control (wet = 489 g m 2; dry = 783 g m 2) were larger than in the AFs. However, due to a clearly higher concentration of nutrients in the litter from the AFs, some nutrient stocks were similar or even greater than in the control. The planted timber species and the green manures were important sources of K and Ca to the litter layer while the peach-palm was an important source of Mg. In general, the litter of AFs had lower C:nutrient ratios than the litter in the secondary forest control, indicating a faster nutrient recycling in the AFs. © Springer 2005.

AB  - The objective of this study is to evaluate the relationship between the response (σ°) of airborne P-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) polarimetric data versus biomass values of primary forest and secondary succession. To ensure that different landscapes of "Terra firme" tropical forest of the Brazilian Amazon were represented, a test-site was selected in the lower Tapajós river region (Pará State). The microwave signals from the P-band polarimetric images were related to the aboveground biomass data by statistical regression models (logarithmic and polynomial functions). In the field survey, physiognomic and structural aspects of primary forest and regrowth were collected and afterwards the biomass was estimated using allometric equations based on dendrometric parameters. As an example of the potential use of P-band polarimetric images, they were classified by a contextual classifier (ICM), whose thematic stratification of land use/land cover was associated with biomass class intervals for mapping purposes. The main objective of this P-band experiment is to improve this tool for regional mapping of Amazon landscape changes, due to the growing rate of land use occupation. © 2003 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Commercial exploitation of non-timber forest products has been playing a major role in the northern Bolivian Amazon for more than a century. Initially relying on the exploitation of rubber, the regional economy underwent a first diversification as a consequence of the post-World War 1 rubber crisis: rubber tapping became supplemented with subsistence agriculture and Brazil nut extraction. This mode of making one's living prevailed in the region for several decades until Bolivian rubber trade came to a standstill in the early 1990s. The recent rubber crisis called again for substantial modifications of the regional economy. This paper examines the conversion from a rubber-based economy into production modes making broader use of forest resources. A village-level survey conducted in 163 rural settlements gave evidence that increased commercialization of Brazil nuts, palm hearts, and timber largely offset progressively lower incomes from rubber exploitation. In addition subsistence and market-oriented agriculture were expanded. Palm heart and timber extraction is likely to exceed natural regeneration rates, and therefore socio-economic needs and ecological requirements are yet to be reconciled in the post-rubber era of the northern Bolivian Amazon.

AB  - We evaluated forest structure and composition in 9- to 13-year-old stands established on a bauxite-mined site at Trombetas (Para), Brazil, using four different reforestation tecniques following initial site preparation and topsoil replacement. These techniques included reliance on natural forest regeneration, mixed commercial species plantings of mostly exotic timber trees, direct seeding with mostly native early successional tree species, and mixed native species plantings of more than 70 tree species (the current operational restoration treatment at this site). Replicated fixed-radius plots in each treatment and in undisturbed primary forest were used to quantify the canopy and understory structure and the abundance and diversity of all vascular plant species. Treatment comparisons considered regeneration density, species richness and diversity for all floristic categories, and, for trees and shrubs, the relative contribution of initial planting and subsequent regeneration from soil seed banks and seed inputs from nearby primary forests. With the possible exception of the stands of mixed commercial species, which were superior to all others in terms of tree basal-area development but relatively poor in species richness, all treatments were structurally and floristically diverse, with a high probability of long-term restoration success. Of these, the mixed native species plantings appeared to be at least risk of arrested succession due to the dominance of a broader range of tree species of different successional stages or expected life spans. In all treatments, several locally important families of primary forest trees (Annonaceae, Chrysobalanaceae, Lauraceae, Palmae and Sapotaceae) were markedly underrepresented due to a combination of poor survival of initial plantings and limitations on seed dispersal from the surrounding primary forest.

AB  - Biomass accumulation in the secondary forests of abandoned pastures and slash-and-burn agricultural fallows is an important but poorly constrained component of the regional carbon budget for the Brazilian Amazon. Using empirical relationships derived from a global analysis, we predicted potential aboveground biomass accumulation (ABA) for the region's regrowth forests based on soil texture and climate data. For regrowth forests on nonsandy soils, the globally derived relationship provided a nearly unbiased linear predictor of Amazonian validation data consisting of 66 stands at seven sites; there was no significant difference between stands that regrew following use as pasture land and those that regrew following slash-and-burn agriculture. For regrowth forests on nonsandy soil, the 1 sigma error range of our ABA model was 58%-171% for the Amazonian validation data. For regrowth forests on sandy soils, the validation data were limited to 19 stands at one site, and the globally derived relationship was substantially biased multiplicatively and nonlinearly. Hence we developed a rerefinement by adding to our validation data ABA values from the two Amazonian sites with sandy soil that had previously been included in the global analysis. Based on a conservative jackknife goodness-of-fit assessment (leaving out one site at a time), we calculated a 1 sigma error range of 42%-158% for our sandy soil Amazonian regrowth forest ABA model. We present our predictions of potential regrowth forest ABA as a set of 0.5° resolution maps for the region at 5, 10, and 20 years following abandonment.

AB  - As part of a larger study evaluating several silvicultural techniques for restoring tropical moist forests on abandoned agricultural lands in southeastern Brazil, direct seeding with five early-successional Atlantic forest species was tested at three degraded sites, characterized by different soil types and land-use histories, within the Environmental Protection Area at Botucatu, SP. The species used in this study were Chorisia speciosa, Croton floribundus, Enterolobium contorstisiliquum, Mimosa scabrella, and Schizolobium parahyba. Scarified seeds of each of these species were sown in prepared seed spots in replicated, 0.25 ha mixed-species plots at an initial espacement of 1 m×1 m at each site. Of the five species planted, only two, Enterolobium and Schizolobium, showed good seed germination, seedling survival, and early growth rates, averaging 4.1-4.6 cm stem diameter and 1.5-1.7 m height growth during the first 2 years after sowing. These two species constituted 88-100% of the total stand density, which ranged from 1050 to 1790 stems ha-1 at 2 years. Despite the poor performance of the other species tested, we observed that the natural regeneration of native forest species originating from remnant forests in the general vicinity of our study sites was significantly greater within the direct-seeded plots than in unplanted control plots that were protected from fire and other disturbances.

AB  - Although flooding and the highly dynamic geomorphology influence ecophysiology of trees in Amazonian white-water forests (várzea), information about the extent of these environmental conditions on distribution and richness of tree species is scarce. To better understand dynamic of natural forest succession and the development of different várzea forest types, we inventoried structure and floristic composition of trees ≥10 cm DBH in a total area of 5.24 ha in várzea forests near Tefé and near Manaus, Brazilian Amazon. The forests were of different successional stages and situated on different sites along the flood-level gradient. Topography and average inundation of all inventoried trees was measured with a theodolite. Sedimentation was recorded during the aquatic phase 2000 and the soil texture in each site determined. The low-várzea forests were composed of different successional stages subjected to annual floods between 7 and 3 m. Stand density per hectare averaged 490 individuals in the early successional stage, up to 1000 individuals in the early secondary stage and 434 individuals in the late successional stage, species richness amounted to 4, 45 and 91 tree species, respectively. The high-várzea forests were late successional stages subjected to annual inundations above 3 m. Stand density per hectare averaged 407 individuals and species richness amounted to 68 species in a frequently exploited forest near Manaus and to 172 species in a undisturbed forest near Tefé. Species richness and distribution along the gradients of flooding and sedimentation was well defined. Only 2.6% of 222 recorded tree species occurred over the whole flood-level gradient. Sedimentation was highest in the early successional stages near the slip-off slopes of the main-river channels, and decreased with increasing topographic level of the forested sites and proceeding succession, reaching lowest rates in the high-várzea forests. Simultaneously, soil texture changed from coarse-grained soils in early stages to fine-grained soils in subsequent stages. Thus, natural succession in várzea forests is linked to the biogenical induced silting up of the sites, because dunes and large stems building trees slow down water energy and favour the deposition of fine grained sediment. A special vegetation unit within the low várzea is the 'chavascal', a species-poor swamp forest, which establishes in the marginal zone of lakes or in ancient silted up river arms. Since it is located off the direct influence of the main-river channels, it seems to be characterised by longstanding stable environmental conditions, and therefore cannot rank with the successional sequence near the highly dynamic river systems. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The natural regeneration of some desirable species under exploitation pressure in Amazon is often very poor or non-existent. The traditional techniques of enrichment planting have presented low performance of the planted seedlings and high costs for its implementation. This study analyzes the first 5 years of growth and survival of five tropical tree species (Bertholletia excelsa, Ceiba pentandra, Torresia acreana, Swietenia macrophylla and Cedrela fissilis) planted in skidding trails and exploitation gaps. The basic planting technique consisted in using the cleared areas after forest harvesting for the establishment of seedlings of species ecologically adapted to the gap environment. The study was carried out in the EMBRAPA-CPAF-ACRE (Agroforestry Research Centre of Acre) in Acre State in West Amazon. The diameter increment varied from 0.30 cm year-1 for Bertholletia to 0.52 cm year-1 for Swietenia and Torresia. After 5 years the height growth was similar for all species around 3.0 m. In the first year Bertholletia presented a high mortality, around 80%, caused by severe predation by rodents. Ceiba also presented a high mortality after the second year of planting probably due the canopy closure. The best survival percentage was presented by Torresia, over 90%. The Meliaceae (Swietenia and Cedrela) species had a similar survival, around 70 to 75%. The Hypsipyla grandella attack was more severe in Cedrela than in Swietenia, but in both cases (9.37 and 31% after 7 and 5 years respectively for Swietenia and Cedrela) was still low when compared with other enrichment plantings.

AB  - In the Cerrado of Brazil, the largest Neotropical savanna region, open habitats are suffering an intense process of conversion to pasture and agricultural land. This study evaluated the responses of birds to the thinning of tree and shrub cover in plots of cerrado sensu stricto, the dominant habitat in the region, and examined whether disturbed plots supported bird communities of open natural habitats with similar structure. Birds were censused by point counts in five disturbed sites and in seven preserved patches, with a total of 304 samples of 20 minutes in 68 points. Cleared plots were not suitable for species strongly dependent on trees and shrubs, such as frugivores and most insectivores. Their abundance was associated with the complexity of vegetation structure in these plots. Shrubby pastures held about 120% more species than the traditional cleared ones. Bird communities of pastures showed large differences in relation to those of grasslands with similar structure. Communities of pastures were dominated by a seedeater, the Blue-black Grassquit Volatinia jacarina, and most species were habitat generalist or oportunistic predators, such as raptors and insectivores. Obligate grassland species, like the Grass Wren Cistothorus platensis, Cock-tailed Tyrant Alectrurus tricolor and Black-masked Finch Coryphaspiza melanotis, as well as other abundant species in grasslands, such as Sharp-tailed Grass-tyrant Culicivora caudacuta and Capped Seedeater Sporophila bouvreuil do not adapt to pastures. Grassland grasses probably do not recover spontaneously in abandoned pastures and in other agricultural lands. Thus, conservation of grassland birds will strongly depend on a urgent programme of identification and protection of large areas of Cerrado dominated by campo limpo and campo sujo. These species would also benefit from the maintenance of a band of grassland along gallery forests.

AB  - Secondary forests may become increasingly important as temporary reservoirs of genetic diversity, stocks of carbon and nutrients, and moderators of hydrologic cycles in the Amazon Basin as agricultural lands are abandoned and often later cleared again for agriculture. We studied a municipality in northeastern Pará, Brazil, that has been settled for over a century and where numerous cycles of slash and burn agriculture have occurred. The forests were grouped into young (3-6 years), intermediate (10-20 years), advanced (40-70 years), and mature successional stages using 1999 Landsat 7 ETM imagery. Supervised classification of the imagery showed that these forest classes occupied 22%, 13%, 9%, and 6% of the area, respectively. Although this area underwent widespread deforestation many decades ago, forest of some type covers about 50% of the area. Row crops, tree crops, and pastures cover 8%, 20%, and 22%, respectively. The best separation among land covers appeared in a plot of NDVI versus band 5 reflectance. The same groupings of successional forests were derived independently from indices of similarity among tree species composition. Measured distributions of tree height and diameter also covaried with these successional classes, with the young forests having nearly uniform distributions, whereas multiple height and diameter classes were present in the advanced successional forests. Biomass accumulated more slowly in this secondary forest chronosequence than has been reported for other areas, which explains why the 70-year-old forests here were still distinguishable from mature forests using spectral properties. Rates of forest regrowth may vary across regions due to differences in edaphic, climatic, and historical land-use factors, thus rendering most relationships among spectral properties and forest age site-specific. Successional status, as characterized by species composition, biomass, and distributions of heights and diameters, may be superior to stand age as a means of stratifying these forests for characterization of spectral properties. © 2003 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Forest regrowth is a notable phenomenon across the tropical forest latitudes. Such reforestation takes place in the wake of land abandonment, occurs cyclically in a rotational agricultural system, and may result from the deliberate planting of trees by farmers. Although less extensive than successional forest regeneration, tree planting by small farmers can have potentially important environmental impacts at both the site and global scale. This paper examines tree-planting efforts by small farmers in the tropical frontier regions of Panama and Brazil in order to gauge the magnitude of reforestation activities, and to identify factors that influence these efforts. This paper discusses the environmental regulations, forestry law, and tenure institutions in both countries, and performs a comparative analysis of reforestation efforts with information derived from household surveys (n = 356) and in-depth tree planting interviews (n = 35). Results from logistic regression are also presented. Our results show that tree planting occurs more frequently in Panama, which we attribute to greater external support in the provisioning of extension and materials and strong market incentives. We suggest that the proximity of the study sites to Panama City facilitates external support and market drivers. Finally, our results suggest that land tenure security is an influential determinant of reforestation activities in both countries.

AB  - DINAMICA, a spatially explicit simulation model of landscape dynamics has been developed. DINAMICA is a cellular automata model that presents multi-scale vicinity-based transitional functions, incorporation of spatial feedback approach to a stochastic multi-step simulation engine, and the application of logistic regression to calculate the spatial dynamic transition probabilities. This model was initially conceived for the simulation of Amazonian landscape dynamics, particularly the landscapes evolved in areas occupied by small farms. For testing its performance, the model was used to simulate spatial patterns of land-use and land-cover changes produced by the Amazonian colonists in clearing the forest, cultivating the land, and eventually abandoning it for vegetation succession. The study area is located in an Amazonian colonization frontier in the north of Mato Grosso state, Brazil. The model was run for two sub-areas of colonization projects, using an 8-year time span, from 1986 to 1994. The simulated maps were compared with land-use and land-cover maps, obtained from digital classification of remote sensing images, using the multiple resolution fitting procedure and a set of landscape structure measures, including fractal dimension, contagion index, and the number of patches for each type of land-use and land-cover class. The results from the validation methods for the two areas showed a good performance of the model, indicating that it can be used for replicating the spatial patterns created by landscape dynamics in Amazonian colonization regions occupied by small farms. Possible applications of DINAMICA include the evaluation of landscape fragmentation produced by different architectures of colonization projects and the prediction of a region's spatial pattern evolution according to various dynamic phases. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - This paper provides a household-level framework to understand the occurrence of secondary forests. We focus on the role of household life cycles as determinants of secondary vegetation on small farms in tropical Latin America. Following a review of socioeconomic research on secondary growth and a theoretical discussion of life cycle dynamics and land use, we pursue an empirical analysis of the determinants of fallows and abandoned plots among farm lots in Uruará, a colony in the Brazilian Amazon. The findings indicate strong effects of life cycle factors, and bear implications for policies aiming to foster agricultural production alongside forest conservation. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - A sustainable yield management system is proposed for Euterpe edulis (‘Palmiteiro’) based on field studies. Since this Brazilian palm integrates the forest in the intermediate succession stages and grows naturally in shaded areas, its exploitation requires neither forest destruction nor forest gaps. This system, based on the cyclic exploitation and on equating species exploitation, was accomplished by defining three basic parameters: (i) the number of seed producing trees per area and their maintenance to ensure natural regeneration and the maintenance of population genetic structure and diversity levels, (ii) the available stock, used to determine the degree of exploitation, and (iii) the species increment rates in order to define the cutting cycle length. These parameters were estimated from permanent plot inventories. In São Pedro de Alcântara (SC), the exploitation of ‘palmiteiro’ trees with diameter at breast height above 8.5 cm, leaving 50 seed producing trees, yields 51.2 kg/ha of heart-of-palm (‘palmito’) in the first cycle. The sustainable yield management of this palm tree is (i) important to conservation because it allows the demographic and genetic structure maintenance, and (ii) economically viable because its edible product, the heart-of-palm, which has high economic value, can provide subsistence to several traditional communities. © 2000 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Rooted cuttings (Stecklings) are used world-wide for cloning forest trees and for bulking scarce or valuable forest tree seed. In cloning, numerous copies are made of very few genotypes, and each genotype (clone) is tracked and managed separately. In contrast, bulking involves making relatively few copies of many genotypes of a selected family or seed lot. Management and tracking are normally at the family level. Greater genetic gains can be achieved by cloning, but extensive and lengthy testing programs are required. With bulking, genetic gains are not as high but can be captured more rapidly. The world's oldest rooted cutting programs are the ancient cloning programs developed in China and Japan. In China, Chinese fir (Cunninghamia lanceolata [Lamb.] Hook.) has been clonally propagated from stump sprouts for at least 800 years. Clones are deployed in small, monoclonal blocks and clear-cut harvested. About 60 million Chinese fir cuttings were produced in 1991. In Japan, cloning with sugi (Cryptomeria japonica D. Don) cuttings has been carried out on a large scale for at least 500 years. These programs are highly regionalized, with the various prefectures propagating clones which are well adapted to the local climate and soils. Hardwood cloning is accomplished primarily with eucalyptus (Eucalyptus sp.), poplars (Populus sp.) and willows (Salix sp.). The large eucalyptus programs began in 1953 in the Peoples' Republic of Congo, where today about 1.2 million cuttings are set annually. Soon after this (1967), the well known Aracruz program was launched in Brazil. In both of these programs, use of clones has resulted in a doubling of volume yield and dramatic improvement in wood quality. Poplar and willow cloning have been practiced throughout Europe, Mid-Asia and the near-East for centuries. Over 1,500,000 ha of these clonal plantations exist today. In the United States, interest in poplar cloning has grown appreciably during the past decade. About 20,000 to 30,000 ha of clonal poplar plantations are established here annually. Bulking is practiced on a much smaller scale than cloning and involves primarily conifers. In Australia and New Zealand, several companies currently rely on radiata pine (Pinus radiata D. Don) rooted cuttings to meet their primary planting stock requirements. While methods vary across companies, most employ hedges for cutting production, followed by in-nursery rooting. Production across these programs was 3.3 million in 1992. An added benefit of rooted cuttings in these applications is that the trees derived from them tend to have higher quality stems (fewer and smaller branches and less taper) than seed-derived trees. Several smaller spruce-based bulking programs have been developed in Europe and Scandinavia with Norway spruce (Picea abies L.) and in Canada with black spruce (P. mariana [Mill.] B.S.P.). Great Britain and Ireland have also developed programs with Sitka spruce (P. sitchensis [Bong.] Carr.) and, to a lesser extent, hybrid larch (Larix ×eurolepis Henry). Owing to high stock costs and loss of government subsidies, some of these programs have been reduced or abandoned. The largest bulking program in the United States is Weyerhaeuser Company's Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii [Mirb.] Franco) program, where rooted cuttings are produced from elite control-pollinated seed. This process has achieved a bulking factor of about 21 (21 packable trees per individual seed sown). Annual production is in excess of 2 million.

AB  - Data on carbon and biomass budgets under different land use in tropical savannas and some dry forests are reviewed. Global data show wide ranges of biomass carbon stocks (20-150 Mg C ha-1), net primary production (2-15 Mg C ha-1y-1) and litter production (2-10 Mg C ha-1y-1) for the semiarid tropics. Although ranges for soil carbon are also wide, an average figure for the top 20 cm is probably 10 g C kg-1, or about 25 Mg C ha-1]. In order to arrive at a better understanding of C budgets and their controls, two regional reviews are presented for NE Brazil and W. Africa. In NE Brazil approximately 40% of the lands have 'near-climax' native vegetation. Less than 10% of the area is planted annually, but about 3-4 times that area is affected by shifting cultivation which has an average cycle of 5 y arable use followed by 20 y or more recovery. Standing biomass of native caatinga shows nearly the full global range with 2-50 Mg C ha-1. Litter fall around 1-2 Mg C ha-1y-1 is partly decomposed and partly consumed by animals, resulting in low average soil C levels near 8 g kg-1, or 20 Mg C ha-1. Under cultivation, C sequestration is decreased, and soils lose approximately half their C stocks before being abandoned. In W. Africa between 50-70% of the land is under a management regime with minimal C returns to the soils. Overgrazing and over-exploitation for fuel wood has resulted in land degradation. Short fallow periods on cultivated lands have caused serious declines in soil C stocks. Both C sequestration and stocks are therefore lower in W. Africa than in NE Brazil. Improvements in the C sequestration in these semi arid regions depend on an increase in crop production under suitable rotations, improved fallow and animal husbandry, and a limitation on biomass burning. Use of fertilizer is required for improved productivities but socioeconomic constraints largely prevent such improvements, resulting in a very limited scope for changes in soil C management.

AB  - Seedlings from 43 native woody species belonging to different successional groups from the Tibagi River Basin, Parana State, South Brazil were studied to obtain information on the importance of colonization by native arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi. The experiment was carried out in a greenhouse for 15 to 45 wk, with soil-mix treatments and four successional groups. The mycorrhizal dependency was 90, 48, 12 and 14% of the pioneer, early secondary, late secondary and climax species, respectively. The content of P, Ca and K was 20, 17 and 23 times greater, respectively, in the leaves of the pioneer species than in the other successional groups. The colonization by AM fungi in field was studied in seedlings of 36 native woody species collected in the interior of the forest of the Mata dos Godoy State Park, and in open area at the beginning of arboreal succession. The mycorrhizal colonization in the field was 55.5, 26.9, 6.1 and 2.2% for the pioneer, early secondary, late secondary and climax species, respectively. To assess the mycorrhizal inoculum potential, rhizosphere soil was collected in the interior of the forest and a gap in the same forest and in a cleared area abandoned for natural regeneration. The inoculum potentials and the spore number in the area at the beginning of succession were 5.6 and 53.4 times greater than in the interior of the forest. The results show that the initial growth of the woody species which take part in the initial phases of succession may be more dependent on the AM fungi, in soils poor in minerals, while those that make up the final succession phases may be less dependent. The potential of the AM fungi inoculum decreases throughout the successional process and there is a relation between the inoculum potential found in the field and the occurrence for the different habitats of the species of adult plants belonging to different successional groups.

AB  - Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi colonization and response were studied in seedlings of 80 native woody species belonging to different successional groups from the Tibagi River Basin, Paraná State, south Brazil. This study includes data from 43 native woody species already published. The results with 80 species did not differ from the results of the 43 species. The experiment was carried out in a greenhouse in plastic bags filled with a mix of subsoil (85%) and sand (15%), inoculated or not with spores of native AM fungi obtained from rhizosphere soil of different native tree species in an area with natural vegetation dominated by woody pioneer species. The successional groups were represented by 16 pioneer, 20 early secondary, 29 late-secondary and 15 climax species. The AM response and colonization in the greenhouse were 5.9 and 4.2 times greater in the early successional species than in the late-successional species, respectively. Seedlings of 49 woody species were collected in the interior under the canopy of the tropical forest of the Mata dos Godoy State Park and in a cleared area dominated by woody pioneer species. The percentage of AM colonization in the field was 54.9, 40.4, 7.2 and 3.1 for the pioneer, early secondary, late-secondary and climax species, respectively. The response to AM inoculation was strongly and directly related to AM colonization in the greenhouse and field and inversely related to seed weight. The AM colonization in the greenhouse was strongly and directly related to AM colonization in field. The late-successional species showed lower AM colonization and response than early successional species. The accentuated mycotrophism of the early successional species may be involved in their establishment, growth, survival and early forest structuring on low-fertility soils.

AB  - Because of some catastrophic events which occurred in Mexico during the 1980 decade, the utilization of "tepescohuite" bark against skin wounds and bums was popularized. The media manipulated the lack of available information about its medical properties and gave erroneous information to the society propagating a lot of myths. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to determine its taxonomic identity and to study the distribution, bark and wood anatomy of this species, and to determine its actual and historic uses, and the compilation of the information about bark pharmacology and toxicity. Its taxonomic identity is established as Mimosa tenuiflora (Willd.) Poir. (Fabaceae-Mimosoideae). It blooms and fructifies from November to June, occurring in Mexico (the states of Oaxaca and Chiapas), Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Panama, Colombia, Venezuela and Brazil, at altitudes of 0-1110 (-1520) m. In Mexico, it is found in dry forests, thorny thickets, Pinus and Pinus-Quercus forests, and in M. tenuiflora pure thickets, along roads and in resting or abandoned culture lands. This species has an aggregate distribution in the forests and a uniform one in the thickets. It presents a mean density of 9 individuals per m2, with 0.45 of frequency per quadrat and 1.69 m2 of mean coverture, and it has a wide range of tolerance to climatic and edaphic factors, confirming their invasive character. Regionally, the wood is used as fuel and fence construction, and against skin wounds and burns (bark tea, powder and/or ointment), and diverse products, such as shampoos, creams, capsules, soaps, etc., are commercialized. The bark is wrinkled, reddish-brown to grey, fibrous texture, 0.5-1.5 mm thick, resinous and with an astringent odor and flavor, and with a great quantity of tannins. The wood presents extremely short vessel elements, with alternate areolate punctuations, and simple perforated plates, vasicentric axial parenchima, confluent stripes, uniseriated rays, extremely short, fine and very short libriform fibres. The bark contains tannins, saponins, an alkaloide fraction, lipids, phytosterols, glucosides, xylose, rhamnose, arabinose, lupeol, methoxychalcones, and kukulkanins.

AB  - Permanent plots were studied over 6 years in approximately 64 ha of undisturbed gallery forest alongside the Gama stream in the Federal District, Brazil. Trees from 31 cm girth at breast height (gbh) (ca. 10 cm diameter at breast height (dbh)) were measured every 3 years from 1985 in 151 (10 m x 20 m) permanent plots. Natural regeneration (individuals under 31 cm gbh) was measured in 1986, 1989 and 1991 in subplots within the 200 m2 plots. The total tree flora (gbh ≤ 31 cm) consisted of 93 species, 81 genera and 44 families in 1985. Almost all species, present as trees, had seedlings and saplings at some time during the measurement period, but for most species one of these phases was missing on some occasions. Regeneration of about 80% of the species occurred in the establishment phase (poles). The density structure of trees and natural regeneration was similar to each other with more than 80% of the species occurring at low densities. The rate of decrease between successive height classes was around 50%, indicating the typical low level of establishment for juveniles in tropical forests. The species most abundant as trees also had abundant regeneration, apart from few exceptions. Therefore, the Gama community seems to be robust enough to maintain a diversity of species and structure in undisturbed conditions.

AB  - The structure and dynamics of approximately 64 ha of undisturbed gallery forest were studied over six years. Trees from 31 cm gbh (c. 10 cm dbh) were measured every three years from 1985. They were in 151 (10×20 m) permanent plots in the Gama forest in the Federal District of Brazil. Natural regeneration (individuals under 31 cm gbh) was measured in subplots (of 2×2 m, 5×5 m and 10×10 m) within the 200 m2 plots. The total tree flora (gbh≥31 cm) consisted of 93 species, 81 genera and 44 families in 1985. The Leguminosae, Myrtaceae and Rubiaceae were the families richest in number of species. Most individuals and species were under 45 cm diameter and 20 m high while the maximum diameter per species ranged from 30 to 95 cm. The density structure of trees and natural regeneration was similar, in which the densities of c. 80% of the species represented less than 1% of the total density. The periodic mean annual diameter increment for trees from 10 cm dbh, was c. 0.25 cm/year. Variability was high with coefficients of variation c. 100% or more. The Gama community may maintain tree diversity and structure in undisturbed conditions. Regeneration of c. 80% of the species was found in the establishing phase (poles); the diameter structure was typical of native forests with the number of individuals decreasing with increasing size classes and showing little change over the six years; recruitment compensated for the mortality of most of the abundant species. The soils in Gama gallery forest were dystrophic with high aluminium content. Multivariate analysis suggested the stream, natural gaps and edges as the main causes of floristic differentiation at the community level. © 1995 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

AB  - Biomass estimates of primary and different ages of secondary vegetation are reported for a tropical forest region in Rondônia, Western Brazilian Amazon. The estimates are based on published allometric equations, and on vegetation composition and allometric data collected in areas of primary forest and secondary vegetation of ages 2, 3, 5, 9,11, 16 and 18 years. Primary forest biomass estimates varied from 290 to 495 t ha-1. Secondary vegetation biomass estimates accounted for 40-60% of the primary forest biomass after 18 years of abandonment. Secondary growth rates in lightly used areas are estimated to have varied from 6.6 to 8.7 t ha-1 y-1 between the third and the eighteenth years after abandonment. CO2 sequestration by regrowing vegetation is discussed for two scenarios of land abandonment. © 1997 Blackwell Science Ltd.

AB  - The spatial distribution of human activities in forest frontier regions is strongly influenced by transportation infrastructure. With the planned paving of 6000 km of highway in the Amazon Basin, agricultural frontier expansion will follow, triggering potentially large changes in the location and rate of deforestation. We developed a landcover change simulation model that is responsive to road paving and policy intervention scenarios for the BR-163 highway in central Amazonia. This corridor links the cities of Cuiabá, in central Brazil, and Santarém, on the southern margin of the Amazon River. It connects important soybean production regions and burgeoning population centers in Mato Grosso State with the international port of Santarém, but 1000 km of this road are still not paved. It is within this context that the Brazilian government has prioritized the paving of this road to turn it into a major soybean exportation facility. The model assesses the impacts of this road paving within four scenarios: two population scenarios (high and moderate growth) and two policy intervention scenarios. In the 'business-asusual' policy scenario, the responses of deforestation and land abandonment to road paving are estimated based on historical rates of Amazon regions that had a major road paved. In the 'governance' scenario, several plausible improvements in the enforcement of environmental regulations, support for sustainable land-use systems, and local institutional capacity are invoked to modify the historical rates. Model inputs include data collected during expeditions and through participatory mapping exercises conducted with agents from four major frontier types along the road. The model has two components. A scenario-generating submodel is coupled to a landscape dynamics simulator, 'DINAMICA', which spatially allocates the land-cover transitions using a GIS database. The model was run for 30 years, divided into annual time steps. It predicted more than twice as much deforestation along the corridor in business-as-usual vs. governance scenarios. The model demonstrates how field data gathered along a 1000 km corridor can be used to develop plausible scenarios of future land-cover change trajectories that are relevant to both global change science and the decision-making process of governments and civil society in an important rainforest region. © 2004 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

AB  - The characteristics of nitrogen acquisition, transport and assimilation were investigated in species of an Atlantic Forest succession over calcareous soil in south-eastern Brazil. Differences in behaviour were observed within the regeneration guilds. Pioneer species showed high leaf nitrogen contents, a high capacity to respond to increased soil nitrogen availability, a high capacity for leaf nitrate assimilation and were characterized by the transport of nitrate + asparagine. At the other end of the succession, late secondary species had low leaf nitrogen contents, little capacity to respond to increased soil nitrogen availability, low leaf nitrate assimilation and were active in the transport of asparagine + arginine. The characteristics of nitrogen nutrition in some early secondary species showed similarities to those of pioneer species whereas others more closely resembled late secondary species. Average leaf δ15N values increased along the successional gradient. The results indicate that the nitrogen metabolism characteristics of species may be an additional ecophysiological tool in classifying tropical forest tree species into ecological guilds, and may have implications for regeneration programmes in degraded areas.

AB  - In countries with few remnants of natural forest there is a trend to plant homogeneous forest in old field soils abandoned because of their low fertility (Hunter, 1996). The same trend has occurred in Brazil, were reforestation programs tend to occupy soils with low fertility. Eucalyptus is the most important genera planted in Brazil, because of its large use and adaptation to several different regions. A possible problem with these fast growing tree plantations is their high soil nutrient demand. Because of this characteristic, management strategies that do not destabilize soil fertility should be encouraged. The purpose of this work was to quantify the nutrient dynamics of 50-year old Eucalyptus saligna plantation, with the objective of improving production sustainability. Wood harvesting was responsible for the following amount of nutrient losses: 80.0 kg.ha-1 for N, 10.32 kg.ha-1 for P, 68.41 kg.ha-1 for K, 67.09 kg.ha-1 for Ca and 36.13 kg.ha-1 for Mg. Leaves and small branches, which stayed in the catchment after wood harvest, had a nutrient amount of 44.88 kg.ha-1 for N, 3.2 kg.ha-1 for P, 12.82 kg.ha-1 for K 12.25 kg.ha-1 for Ca and 7.69 kg.ha-1 for Mg in the leaves and 35.13 kg.ha-1 for N, 2.52 kg.ha-1 for P, 18.72 kg.ha-1 for K, 17.29 kg.ha-1 for Ca and 8.86 kg.ha-1 for Mg in the branches. The catchment biogeochemical budget from September 1991 to August 1998 showed a total nutrient loss of 56.79 kg.ha-1 for K, 72.92 kg.ha-1 for Ca, and 40.89 kg.ha-1 for Mg. The maintenance of the integrity of the catchment riparian forest, as well as the forest floor, coupled with a conservative harvesting technique and a rapid Eucalyptus regeneration, were considered important factors which were responsible for the relatively minor impacts of the clearcutting on nutrient losses from the catchment. Leaves and small branches, which stayed in the catchment after wood harvesting, were considered important contribution in terms of soil conservation and fertility.

AB  - Spot-mapping of territories was used to document the restriction of nineteen bird species to thickets of bamboo (Guadua weberbaueri) in lowland forests in southeastern Peru. These species were defined as bamboo specialists. An additional seven species showed a preference for such thickets, but also used other habitats. These results correspond with previous, qualitative descriptions of the habitat preferences of bamboo specialists. At least four specialists are restricted to thickets throughout their entire geographic range (obligate bamboo specialists); another nine specialists may use other habitats sparingly away from southeastern Peru (near-obligate bamboo specialists); the remaining six species are frequent users of habitats lacking bamboo away from southeastern Peru (facultative bamboo specialists). The nonbamboo habitats used by the 13 near-obligate and facultative specialists are predominantly dense habitats with low canopy cover, including treefall gaps and early successional vegetation along rivers. The obligate and near-obligate specialists generally have small geographic ranges centered in southwestern Amazonia; a few have sister taxa in southeastern Brazil that are also bamboo specialists suggesting a common evolutionary history. The facultative specialists are generally more widespread. Bamboo specialists are more abundant in bamboo habitats than are other bird species in more generalized habitats.

AB  - Abstract:  We sampled understory bummingbirds in Amazonian forest fragments from before isolation through nine years after isolation. We recorded 377 captures of eight species in five 1‐ba fragments and four 10‐ha fragments. The three species netted before isolation, Phaethornis superciliosus, Phaethornis bourcieri, and Thalurania furcata, were nearly equally abundant at that time. After isolation abundance of P. bourcieri and T. furcata did not change, but P. superciliosus became nearly twice as common. Five additional species that were netted only after isolation represented about 10% of the post‐isolation sample. The species recorded only after isolation were forest species usually found above the levels of nets; fragments were not colonized by nonforest species. Use of fragments did not differ between 1‐and 10‐ba fragments. The landscape surrounding the fragments included active cattle pasture, abandoned pasture, and Cecropia‐dominated second growth, but this variation bad little effect on use of fragments by hummingbirds. The results suggest that these understory hummingbirds can persist in a matrix of fragments, secondary growth, and large forest patches. This response is much different than that of the insectivorous birds that dominate the understory bird community at the site, which are much more vulnerable to fragmentation.

AB  - 1. Successional pathways were evaluated in two Amazonian secondary forest communities with different land-use histories. Sites which had been clearcut without subsequent use were dominated after 6-10 years by the pioneer genus Cecropia (Moraceae), whereas those used for pasture before abandonment were dominated by the pioneer genus Vismia (Clusiaceae). 2. There were 58 plant families and 300 species identified in Cecropia stands but only 43 families and 147 species were identified in Vismia stands. There were 77 species in common (Sorensen similarity = 0.34). 3. Differences in species number and composition of recruiting individuals between stand types were significant and were a function of the dominant pioneer genus, stem density, distance from primary forest, and land-use history. Regeneration under Vismia canopy was dominated by small Vistula individuals (25% of plants < 2 cm basal diameter), whereas regeneration under Cecropia canopy was more diverse and did not include a single young Cecropia. 4. The number of regenerating plants in both secondary stand types dropped off sharply with distance (5, 25, 50, and 100 m) from primary forest, suggesting that seed dispersal was limiting plant recruitment. Species richness also declined with distance and could be explained by the decline in plant density. Species richness in Cecropia stands increased linearly with plant density, but in Vismia stands the richness increase with density was a decelerating function. 5. For the central Amazon, secondary succession involves a more rapid return of primary forest species if deforestation is not followed by use as pasture before abandonment.

AB  - With the high rates of deforestation in tropical regions, the restoration of degraded lands has become an important way for maintaining the diversity of plant communities and for creating wildlife habitats. Evaluating the success of restored areas is essential for improving restoration designs and for successfully restoring such complex ecosystems. In this study, the development of restoration forests with respect to age (5, 9 and 10 years old) and the restoration models used (proportion of pioneer trees) was assessed along the margins of Companhia Energética do Estado de São Paulo (CESP) reservoirs, located in the region of Pontal do Pananapanema, in São Paulo state, southeastern Brazil. The overstory (trees ≥4.8cm in DBH) was assessed in nine 900m2 permanent plots, and all woody understory regenerating plants (>50cm in height and <4.8cm in DBH) were counted and identified in 54 1m radius subplots. Canopy and grass cover were assessed in the wet and dry seasons. All of the parameters were recorded again 1 year later to evaluate the development of the forests. In general, neither the restoration design nor age appeared to influence forest structure and dynamics, at least at the developmental stage studied here. The floristic complexity and density of regenerating individuals were still fairly low compared to natural forests. The arrival of propagules from other forest remnants was insignificant, suggesting that inadequate seed dispersal and faunal colonization limited species enrichment within the restoration sites. Although the overall results suggested that these restoration forests had reached a structural complexity sufficient to give a start to secondary succession, some factors such as the dominance of pioneer trees in the overstory, the small number of colonizing individuals arriving from external seed sources, the persistence of weedy grasses in the understory and the degree of isolation of the restoration sites may endanger the sustainability of these forests in the long term. Although neither the age nor restoration model produced differences in the forest structure and dynamics, it is possible that such differences may require a longer time to develop. Monitoring restoration sites is essential for understanding a forest's trajectory and for guiding management and intervention practices. © 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study documents the proportion of woody plant species having different modes of seed dispersal, and classes of seed and fruit size at 16 Atlantic montane forest plots of southeastern Brazil (23-24°S). These plots represent six chronosequences (from 5 year-old to old-growth forest) of forest regeneration following small-scale shifting agriculture. Our results indicate that there is a gradual but predictable increase in the number of woody plant species relying on vertebrate-mediated seed dispersal in increasingly older plots. Moreover, the percentage of plant species bearing small seeds and fruits ( < 0.6 cm in length) was more than halved from earlier to older forest plots, while the percentage of plant species producing middle-sized seeds and fruits at least doubled. Plant species belonging to the Melastomataceae, Myrsinaceae, Rubiaceae and Flacourtiaceae comprised a large proportion of the small-seeded and fruit species (33-53%), and largely occurred in early successional forest plots (5-30 years old). In contrast, species belonging to the Myrtaceae and Lauraceae represented most of the species (51-72%) bearing medium-sized seeds and fruits (0.6-1.5 cm in length), and occurred primarily in the old-growth forests. Shifts in the relative importance of dispersal strategies during the regeneration process of Atlantic montane forest, as well as in diaspore size appear to be related to the balance between early successional and shade-tolerant species associated with particular life forms and plant families. Finally, we discuss the relationships between the species richness of Myrtaceae and Lauraceae trees, seed dispersal by medium to large vertebrates, and possible regeneration scenarios for the Atlantic forest. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - Recent studies of Swietenia macrophylla King argue that natural regeneration of this highly valued tree is episodic and occurs only after infrequent catastrophic disturbance. An analysis of 14 population size-distributions in natural forests shows that population structure varies across this species' range. In forests that are in successional transition from open deciduous forest to evergreen forest there is often prolific regeneration. We show that in this type of forest in southern Pará (Brazil) patches of even-sized trees are small. Large-scale disturbance may be necessary for regeneration only in evergreen forests where little light penetrates through the canopy. The transition zone between evergreen and deciduous forest in Pará is moving south, and we propose that mahogany populations to the north are in the process of competitive exclusion. Sustainable harvesting of mahogany must take account of the successional stage of the forest.

AB  - In Amazonia, millions of hectares of forest have been converted to cattle pasture then abandoned. On sites with histories of heavy use, forest recovery is slow. We compared the process of tree establishment in an abandoned pasture with a history of heavy use and in a mature forest through a series of field studies in northeastern Amazonia. Tree seedling and sprout emergence was ≥20 times lower in the abandoned pasture than in forest understory and forest gaps. Tree emergence was restricted in the abandoned pasture by a lack of tree seeds in the soil (3 tree genera vs 15 in the forest), and a low rate of tree and liana seed deposition by birds and bats in the open vegetation of the abandoned pasture (2 m-2 yr-1). Tree and liana seed deposition in the abandoned pasture was higher beneath treelets (990 m-2 yr-1). Rates of seed removal and consumption by ants and rodents were also higher in the abandoned pasture (> 80% removal within 20 d for 6 tree species) than in forest understorey and forest gaps. Cutter ants (Atta sexdens) hindered tree seedling survivorship and growth in the abandoned pasture by clipping leaves and stems, and preferred tree seedlings to grass and shrub seedlings. In the absence of herbivores, survivorship and height growth of seedling transplants in the abandoned pasture were generally lower than in experimental treefall gaps, and were correlated with harsh environmental conditions in the former. Air temperature, air vapor pressure deficit and soil moisture stress in the abandoned pasture exceeded conditions measured in both treefall gaps and intact forest during the 5-month dry season. Seedling growth in the abandoned pasture was also restricted during the wet season. These barriers to tree establishment help explain the low density and emergence rates of tree seedlings in this abandoned pasture relative to the adjacent mature forest.

AB  - Land cover change may impact watershed hydrology and regional climate by altering land-atmosphere exchanges of energy and water. Conversion of forest to pasture has previously been shown to decrease the rate of evaporation (including transpiration) because of reduced aerodynamic roughness, less canopy rainfall interception and greater canopy resistance during dry periods. However, less is known about the effects of forest replacement land covers other than pasture. In this study, field measurements of meteorological processes, stomatal resistance, and Leaf Area Index (LAI) were taken over various deforested land surfaces in the eastern Amazon Basin and in northern Thailand. Based on these measurements, evaporation and sensible heat flux were estimated over each site. Results show the degree to which different land covers replacing tropical forest affect energy partitioning. In comparison with forest, non-irrigated, actively and recently cultivated sites had sharply lower rates of evaporation. Secondary vegetation generally had higher rates of evaporation than actively or recently used sites. The proportion of energy used for evaporation increased rapidly with age in secondary vegetation. Evaporation rates at sites eight and 25 years after abandonment in the Thailand study area were enhanced by positive sensible energy advection from nearby cultivated areas, and were similar to those of primary forest. Differences in dry season evaporation rates of 3-, 8- and 25-year secondary vegetation are explained, in part, by the differences in canopy resistance. Minimum canopy resistance was 223, 61 and 58 s m-1, respectively at the 3-, 8 - and 25-year sites.

AB  - Lianas are woody vines that rely on external support for height growth. Although variations among species of lianas in traits ranging from climbing mechanism to stem anatomy have been described, little attention has been paid to interspecific differences in life history traits. The objective of this study was to assess the diversity in life history strategies among lianas in an old-growth forest of the eastern Brazilian Amazon. Population size class structure, microsite light environment affinity, forest successional phase affinity, and regeneration mode were assessed and growth and mortality rates were measured over 3 years for six species of lianas: Acacia multipinnata, Bauhinia cupreonitans, Bauhinia guianensis, Croton ascendens, Memora schomburgkii, and Serjania caracasana. Each of the study species had a free-standing seedling phase prior to the initiation of climbing, but the density of free-standing saplings (≥50 cm tall) ranged widely among species from 408 stems ha-1 for B. guianensis to 2 stems ha-1 for A. multipinnata. Species also differed in their propensity for vegetative reiteration of rooted stems; the mean number of climbing ramets per genet ranged from 1.1 for B. guianensis to 7.4 for S. caracasana. Four of the study species (M. schomburgkii, S. caracasana, and both species of Bauhinia) had the majority of climbing ramets in small diameter classes. However, for two of these species (M. schomburgkii and S. caracasana) the size class distributions of the largest stems per genet were flat and unimodal, respectively. A. multipinnata and C. ascends had flat size class distributions of both ramets and largest stems per genet. Among the six species there were three apparent patterns of changing association with light environment and forest successional phase over size classes. Two species (M. schomburgkii and B. guianensis) are late successional species. These species were found in all forest phases at relatively low median levels of illumination as seedlings and free-standing saplings, more frequently associated with gaps as small diameter climbing stems, and in late building and mature phase forest as larger (≥1.5 cm diameter) climbing stems. Three species (B. cupreonitans, S. caracasana, and A. multipinnata) are early successional species. These species were distinguished from late successional species by occurring in better illuminated and more gap-associated microsites as free-standing saplings and by remaining strongly associated with early building phase forest as large diameter stems. Only C. ascendens, is like a pioneer species in being found exclusively in high light microsites in its free-standing stages and associated with gaps or early building phase forest as climbing stems. Median stem diameter growth rates were correlated with successional class ranging from the lowest in late successional species to the highest in the pioneer species. Annual ramet mortality rates differed among species with the lowest rates for the late successional species (1.3 and 4.3% for M. schomburgkii and B. guianensis, respectively). Annual genet mortality rates were lower than ramet mortality rates and ranged from 0. 2% for M. schomburgkii to 5.5% for C. ascendens. The results suggest that, while lianas exhibit a diversity of life history strategies, some patterns in liana life history traits, for example a positive correlation between stem diameter growth rate and mortality rate, may parallel patterns found for trees. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Over the past several decades, the conversion of native forest to agricultural land uses has accelerated across the Amazon Basin. Despite a growing body of research on nutrient dynamics in Amazonian primary forest and forest-derived land uses, the effects of widespread land-use change on nutrient contents and cycles in soil and vegetation are not well understood. We reviewed over 100 studies conducted in Amazônia over the past 40 years on nutrient dynamics in natural forests and forest-derived land uses (pasture, shifting cultivation, and tree plantations). Our objectives were to compare soil data from land uses across Amazônia and identify any gaps in our present knowledge that might offer direction for future research. Specifically, by analyzing data we tested the following five widely cited hypotheses conceming the effects of land-use change on soil properties compiled from 39 studies in multifactorial ANOVA models; (a) soil pH, effective cation exchange capacity (ECEC), and exchangeable calcium (Ca) concentrations rise and remain elevated following the slash-and-bum conversion of forest to pasture or crop fields; (b) soil contents of total carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and inorganic readily extractable (that is, Bray, Mehlich I, or resin) phosphorus (Pi) decline following forestto-pasture conversion; (c) soil concentrations of total C, N, and Pi increase in secondary forests with time since abandonment of agricultural activities; (d) soil nutrient conditions under all tree-dominated land-use systems (natural or not) remain the same; and (e) higher efficiencies of nutrient utilization occur where soil nutrient pools are lower. Following the conversion of Amazonian forest to pasture or slash-and-burn agriculture, we found a significant and lasting effect on soil pH, bulk density, and exchangeable Ca concentrations. Unlike the other three land uses studied, concentrations of extractable soil Pi were equally low in both forest and pastures of all age classes, which demonstrates that postburning pulses in soil Pi concentration following a slash-and-burn decrease rapidly after forest-to-pasture conversion, perhaps due to accumulation in organic P fractions. Neither the concentrations nor the contents of total C and N appeared to change greatly on a regionwide basis as a result of forest-to-pasture conversion, but surface soil C:N ratios in 5-year-old pastures were significantly higher than those in older pastures, suggesting changes in the soil concentrations of at least one of these elements with time after pasture creation. Pasture soils did have higher total C and N concentrations than land uses such as annual cropping and secondary forest fallow, indicating that soil C and N maintenance and/or accumulation following forest conversion may be greater in pastures than in these other two land uses. The low concentrations of C and N in shifting cultivation soils appear to persist for many years in secondary forests regenerating from abandoned crop fields, suggesting that the recuperation of soil losses of C and N resulting during no-input annual cropping is slower than previously thought. Soil C, N and P concentrations were strongly related to clay content. Across all land uses, efficiencies of N, P, and Ca use (estimated as the inverse of litterfall N, P, and Ca contents) were not related to the sizes of their soil pools. More work is needed to test and standardize P extraction procedures that more accurately reflect plant availability. Few studies have been conducted to determine the role of organic P fractions and dissolved organic N (DON) in the elemental cycles of both natural and managed systems in this region. In general, we recommend further study of annual and perennial cropping systems, as well as more detailed examination of managed pastures and fallows, and secondary forests originating from various disturbances, since the intensity of previous land use likely determines the degree of soil degradation and the rate of subsequent secondary regrowth.

AB  - In an area of tropical seasonal semideciduous forest, the soil characteristics, floristic composition, physiognomic structure, and the distribution of three regeneration and three dispersal guilds were studied for four stands within the forest that had documented histories of varying degrees of human disturbance. The aim was to study forest regeneration in areas of preserved forest and secondary forest, with parts of both types of forest experiencing either 'intensive' or 'occasional' cattle trampling. The study was carried out in the Sebastião Aleixo da Silva Ecological Station, Bauru, São Paulo State, Brazil. Two stands were called 'secondary' because they corresponded to forest tracts that were felled and occupied by crops and pastures in the past and then abandoned to forest regeneration ca. 40 years before this study. The other two stands, called 'preserved', corresponded to areas of the fragment where the forest has been maintained with only minor human impacts. The arboreal component of the tree community (diameter at breast height or dbh≥5 cm) was sampled in 20 plots of 40 m×40 m, and the subarboreal component (diameter at the base of the stem or dbs<5 cm and height≥0.5 m) in subplots of 40 m×2 m. Physiognomic features, such as canopy height and density of climbing plants, were registered all over a 5 m×5 m gridline laid on the sample plots. Soil bulk samples were collected for chemical and textural analyses. Most detected differences contrasted the secondary to the preserved forest stands. The soils of the secondary stands showed higher proportions of sand and lower levels of mineral nutrients and organic matter than those of the preserved stands, probably due to higher losses by leaching and erosion. Compared to the secondary stands, the preserved ones had higher proportions of tall trees, higher mean canopy height, lower species diversity, higher abundance of autochorous and shade-tolerant climax species, and lower abundance of pioneer and light-demanding climax species. Despite the high proportion of species shared by the preserved and secondary stands (108 out of 139), they differed consistently in terms of density of the most abundant species. On the other hand, the secondary and preserved stands held similar values for tree density and basal area, suggesting that 40 years were enough to restore these features. Effects of cattle trampling on the vegetation were detected for the frequency of trees of anemochorous and zoochorous species, which were higher in the stands under occasional and intensive cattle trampling, respectively. The density of thin climbers was lower in the stands with intensive trampling. © 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper presents the characterization and analysis of vegetation structure, soils and litter accumulation in four areas dominated by bracatinga (Mimosa scabrella Bentham), a native species of southern Brazil used for the production of firewood. The species forms one single canopy, as it grows in early successional stages of Mixed Ombrofilous Forests with Araucaria angustifolia. The areas were chosen based on their different geological origins. The undegrowth was sampled in order to generate data on density, frequency, dominance, cover and importance values, diversity and similarity indexes. The interactions among litter quantity and nutrient storage, soil chemical properties and vegetation structure are discussed.

AB  - Efforts to quantify net greenhouse gas emissions at the national scale, as required by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, must include both industrial emissions and the net flux associated with the land base. In this study, data on current land use, rates of land-cover change, forest harvest levels, and wildfire extent were analyzed under a common framework for three countries in order to compare net CO2-carbon flux, and to identify key research areas. In the Former Soviet Union (FSU) and the conterminous United States (US), the stand age-class distribution on the forested land and the rate of logging tended to be the most important factors in the land-base flux, whereas in Brazil the rate of land-cover change and the vegetation regrowth in secondary forests on abandoned agricultural or grazing land were critical. The areas of greatest uncertainty for the FSU and US analyses related to the rates of woody debris and soil organic matter accumulation and to limitations in the age-class based inventory data available. In Brazil, the initial biomass in forests subject to deforestation, and the area of recovering secondary forest, were identified as important research issues. Continued database development, and close attention to methodologies for quantifying carbon flux, will be necessary if carbon budget assessments are to be of use to the policy community.

AB  - The objective of this study was to compare the floristic composition and abundance of arboreal and shrub species in two areas of a tropical semideciduous forest in the Mata do Paraiso Reserve, municipal district of Viçosa, MG, southeastern Brazil. Two sites of the forest were selected considering the successional stages, being the first an abandoned pasture area in regeneration process for 40 years, (in this study called initial forest) and the second, a well preserved forest nucleus without antropic intervention in the last 40 years (here called mature forest). In each site, ten plots of 2 × 10 m were placed, in which all individuals with height between 0.30 and 1.50 m were sampled. In each plot hemispheric photographs were obtained and samples of surface soil collected for chemical and physic analyses. A total of 98 species were sampled, 54 in the initial forest and 64 in the mature forest. The mature forest presented higher values of diversity (H' = 3.15) and evenness (J' = 0.79) than the initial forest (H' = 1.91; J' = 0.45). The two sites showed clear differences in the levels of canopy openness and soil fertility, factors that are influencing the floristic differences in the natural regeneration, revealed by cluster analysis.

AB  - Radar images are presently being used in association with optical remote sensing data to characterize the different processes of land use in Brazilian Amazon region. Considering the current development in remote sensing techniques for estimating forest biomass, where L, X and C band images have their limitations, it was recently accomplished a scientific airborne mission with image polarimetric P-band imagery acquisition at lower Rio Tapajós region, Brazil. This study analyses the biomass variation of the primary forest and secondary succession and it's influence on the response of backscatter values in the P-band polarimetric images. The start of this study was the understanding of the behavior of the structural variables of the vegetation cover (measured during the field survey) and its' correlation with the backscatter data obtained from PHH-, PHV- and PVV-band data. A statistical regression model was used to verify the relationship between biomass (estimate by different allometric equations) and P-band polarimetric data. Based on the regression equation that best fits the data sets, a biomass map was elaborated. This was done through the segmentation of the backscatter image, using Caesar 3.0 rwseg algorithm (based on the successive edge detecting and region growing procedures), with the σ° of each resulting segment was converted into biomass values by the best fit function. The final goal of this P-band experiment is to improve the regional inventory and monitoring biomass dynamics, as well as landscape changes, due to human action in Amazon.

AB  - The effects of herbivory by the leaf-cutting ant Atta laevigata Fr. Smith on the reestablishment of forest trees in an abandoned farm near Manaus, central Amazonia, were investigated. Experimental seedling transplants and observations on seedlings which emerged naturally in the study area showed that damage by leaf-cutting ants negatively affected tree seedling survival and growth. However, excluding leaf-cutting ants from experimental plots for 20 mo did not significantly increase tree seedling densities. The number of seedlings emerging varied considerably between plots and this obscured any effect the ants may have had on seedling survivorship. Taller seedlings, and seedlings attacked only once, suffered less mortality than smaller seedlings and seedlings attacked twice or more. In general, mortality was greater for those species preferred by the ants, indicating that selective herbivory by leaf-cutting ants affects tree species composition. The number of seedlings attacked by A. laevigata remained approximately constant throughout the period of this study in spite of the fact that the number available for attack increased. Thus, the chance of any individual seedling being attacked declined with time, suggesting that the effect of Arts herbivory on tree establishment is stronger during the first few years of forest regeneration.

AB  - From towers constructed at the interface between second-growth forest and an active and an abandoned pasture, we observed inter-habitat movements of fruit-eating birds in eastern Amazônia. The abandoned pasture was composed of grasses and forbs with a scattering of shrubs and small trees. The active pasture contained a low, uniform bed of grass. A total of 47 frugivorous bird species was recorded in the second-growth forest. We observed that 18 of these species frequented the adjacent abandoned pasture but only 3 were found in the adjacent active pasture. Fruit-eating birds flying from second-growth forest typically spent only a few minutes in the abandoned pasture, and their movements were generally restricted to a pasture belt of 1-80 m along the border with the second-growth forest. Most inter-habitat movement occurred during the rainy season, which coincided with a peak in fruit availability in the abandoned pasture. Just three bird species, Ramphocelus carbo, Tachyphonus rufus, and Thraupis episcopus, accounted for an estimated 70% of the total movement of frugivores between the second-growth forest and the abandoned pasture. All three species spent most of their time in the abandoned pasture foraging on shrubs and trees but exhibited differences in their preference for specific habitat elements and in their seed-defecation habits. An understanding of bird behaviors in altered landscapes provides important information to planners and policy makers concerned with protecting regional biodiversity and maintaining landscape integrity. This research provides a rationale for placing limits on the size of clearings in the Brazilian Amazon.

AB  - Yeast communities associated with four species of the Drosophila fasciola subgroup (repleta group) in tropical rain forests were surveyed in an abandoned orchard, and rain forest sites of Rio de Janeiro and Ilha Grande, State of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Adult flies of Drosophila carolinae, Drosophila coroica, Drosophila fascioloides and Drosophila onca frequently carried Candida colliculosa, Geotrichum sp, Kloeckera apiculata and a Pichia membranaefaciens-like species. The most frequent yeasts in the crop of flies included Candida collicullosa, C. krusei, Pichia kluyveri and a P. membranaefaciens-like species. The physiological abilities and species composition of these yeast communities differed from those of other forest-inhabiting Drosophila. The narrow feeding niches of the fasciola subgroup suggested the use of only part of the substrates available to the flies as food in the forest environment, as noted previously for cactophilic Drosophila serido (mulleri subgroup of the repleta group) in a sand dune ecosystem. The cactophilic yeasts that were isolated have not been previously found in forests. The fasciola subgroup probably used epiphytic cactus substrates as breeding and feeding sites in the forest. The physiological profile of yeasts associated with the fasciola flies was broader than that of yeasts associated with the cactophilic Drosophila serido, suggesting that the fasciola subgroup represents an older lineage from which the South American repleta species evolved. © 1995 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) was a minor component of the vast natural forests of the southern United States before the region was settled by immigrants. Extensive planting and natural regeneration of cutover forest land and abandoned farmland between 1930 and 1990 made loblolly the leading timber species in the United States. It now predominates on 13.4 million ha (45 percent) of the commercial forest land in the southern United States (between latitudes 28°N and 39°N and longitudes 75°W and 97°W) and directly or indirectly provides 110,000 jobs and $30 billion to the economy of the region. The extreme versatility of loblolly has also provided important environmental contributions to most southern states. These include landscape beautification, erosion control, soil amelioration, excellent wildlife habitat, and outstanding recreational opportunities. Incorporating existing pest management strategies into silvicultural systems can produce substantial and long-lasting insect and disease control with little cost or physical effort. Introductions of loblolly into numerous countries around the world (especially China, Brazil, and Argentina) have proven to be very successful, environmentally sound, and commercially profitable. In some locations, loblolly grows much faster than on sites of similar quality in the southern United States.

AB  - The spatial and temporal pattern of annual rainfall and the strength of the dry season within the Amazon region are poorly known. Existing rainfall maps are based on the data from full-scale, long-term meteorological stations, operated by national organizations linked to the World Meteorological Organisation, such as INMET in Brazil. Stations with 30 or more years of uninterrupted and reliable recordings are very few, considering the size of the region, and most of them are located along the major rivers. It has been suggested that rainfall conditions away from these rivers are substantially different. An analysis has been made of the records of a network of simple pluviometric sites in the Brazilian part of the region as maintained by the National Agency for Electric Energy (ANEEL) since 1970. The latter data sets were used to draw more detailed maps on annual rainfall, and on the strength of the dry season in particular; average number of consecutive months with less than 100 mm, 50 mm, and 10 mm, respectively. Also, some data were obtained on the spatial expression of El Niño events within the region. Subregional differences are large, and it is argued that they are important for the success or failure of agricultural settlements; for the hazard of large-scale fire damage of the still existing primary forest vegetation; for the functioning of this land cover as stock and sink of CO2, and for the likelihood that secondary forests on abandoned agricultural lands will have less biomass. The effects of past El Niño rainfall anomalies on the biodiversity of the natural savannahs within the forest region are discussed.

AB  - Landsat TM scenes for 1985 and 1991 are used to produce a georeferenced map of land cover and land use for an area of the Amazon estuary inhabited by three populations of caboclos with distinct patterns of land use. This information is combined in a geographic information system with ethnographic and survey research carried out over the past 5 years to develop representative spectral "signatures" which permit measurement and differentiation of land uses and the detection of change even between small areas of managed floodplain forest and unmanaged forest, and between three distinct age/growth classes of secondary succession following deforestation. Implementation of these procedures permit the scaling up or down of research at different resolutions. Three distinct patterns of land use are examined with differential impact on the environment. Mechanized agriculture at one site has eliminated virtually all the mature upland forest and is now dominated by secondary successional vegetation. The more traditional system of diversified land use at the next site shows a subtle cycling of flooded forest to managed palm forest through time in response to the price of palm fruit and cycling in the use of fallow land. A third site, based on palm fruit extractivism, shows minimal changes in land cover due to persistent specialization on management of flooded forest extraction. There is little evidence that the community with the greatest impact on forest cover is any better off economically than the two communities which have minimal impact on the landscape. This study suggests how a balance between use and conservation in Amazonia may be achieved in floodplain and estuarine areas, and the effectiveness of monitoring these types of land cover from satellite platforms. © 1994 Plenum Publishing Corporation.

AB  - Nitrogen transformations were measured in soil from 33 sites arranged in 15 classes in five tropical areas. Sites sampled included forests on fertile volcanic and sedimentary soils, infertile oxisols and ultisols, extremely infertile white-sand soils, montane sites, and a primary and a secondary successional sere. In comparison with temperate forests, net N mineralization and nitrification were rapid in intact lowland tropical forests (other than white sands) and microbial 15N uptake was relatively slow. In contrast, white-sand and upper montane sites had lower rates of mineralization and nitrification and greater microbial immobilization of 15N; N could be in short supply in many such sites. These patterns of N transformations reinforce inferences about soil N supply based on patterns of litterfall N in tropical forests. © 1988.

AB  - The Brazilian wood industry is highly mobile. Over the past 20 years the eastern Amazon developed from a logging backwater to the principal hardwood processing center in Brazil. This occurred because of a decline in hardwood stocks in the south of Brazil coupled with the development of good transport, energy, and communications systems in eastern Amazonia. We studied the structure and economy of the wood industry along a 340 km stretch of the Bélem-Brasília Highway in eastern Amazonia. Of the 238 sawmills present in this study region in late 1989, 79% were installed in the 1980s. Ninety-seven percent of the mill owners came from outside Amazonia. Most (63%) of the mill establishments were vertically integrated, engaging in both forest mill processing and forest logging. Logging establishments realize substantial profits. A typical sawmill with one band saw produces, on average, 4300 m3 of sawnwood year-1 from 9200 m3 of roundwood. The value of this sawn production is estimated at $670 800 or $156 m-3. Production costs are $116 m-3 giving an annual mill profit of $170 000. For firms engaged in both logging and processing activities, annual profits were estimated at $217 000 (profit margin, 32%) or $900 ha-1 logged. An average of six trees were harvested per hectare in logging operations (n = 3 study areas) and the volume yield averaged 38 m3 ha-1. Damages to the forest during logging are significant. Twenty-seven trees greater than or equal to 10 cm dbh are severely damaged for each tree harvested. This damage occurs in the opening of approximately 40 m of logging road and 600 m2 of canopy per tree harvested. Vines are favored by these open conditions and forest fires are possible. Forest management is technically feasible but economically unattractive. Natural regeneration is abundant on logged sites: 4300 seedlings and saplings of economic species were registered per hectare. Stocking of larger trees of economic species with good form is also adequate: 16 trees ha-1 greater than or equal to 30 cm dbh. This residual stock could be favored by vine cutting and refinement thinnings at an estimated cost of $180 ha-1. Although these treatments result in increased growth rates, the projected return on management investments is low. Nonetheless, given the robust profits in the wood sector, profit margins would remain well above 20% if management were mandated by law. At present the biggest impediment to forest management in the eastern Amazon is the undervaluing of the timber resource. Ranchers, who own most forest land, sell harvest rights to loggers at low prices -$50-$150 ha-1. After the logging teams extract the timber, these same ranchers are left with badly damaged forest tracts. With careful extraction and management procedures, harvests could be accomplished on a 30- to 40-year rotation and forest integrity could be maintained. Ranchers, insofar as they control the forest resource, have the power to guarantee its wise use. They could do this by supervising harvest operations on their lands to reduce damage and by raising the price of their timber and using this additional revenue to finance simple silvicultural operations. © 1992.

AB  - Vegetation composition, structure, and biomass accumulation were studied on 13 forest sites that had been cut and burned, used as cattle pasture, and then abandoned in the E Amazon near Paragominas, Para, Brazil. Forest regenerated vigorously on sites of previously light use. Above-ground biomass accumulation averaged 10 t ha-1 y-1 or 80 t after 8 yr (c25% of mature forest levels). Tree species richness was also high (c20 per 100 m2) and almost all species also occurred in native forest. Moderately grazed pastures also developed forest but biomass accumulation was only 5 t ha-1 y-1. Tree species richness was also lower than on light-use sites and there were fewer forest trees. Abandoned pastures subjected to heavy use had the least distinct patterns of succession. The 8-yr-old site was dominated by grasses and forbs with <1 tree 100 m-2 and an above-ground biomass accumulation of 0.6 t ha-1 y-1, a value c6% of that found on light-use sites. Light-use sites had significantly higher biomass and species richness than either moderate- or heavy-use sites. Site age was a good predictor of above-ground biomass accumulation on light- and moderate-use sites, but not on heavy-use sites. Only where land has been used too intensively for long-periods is reforestation uncertain, but probably <10% of the pasture land in N Para has degraded to this level. Re-growth forest, regardless of pasture-use history, will not necessarily have the same characteristics of physiognomy or species composition as that originally occupying the site. As burning becomes more prevalent in eastern Amazonia, abandoned sites may not develop into forest and irreversible degradation of the regional ecosystem must be contemplated.

AB  - Large-scale forest conversion in Brazil, primarily to cattle pasture, contributes significantly to the global anthropogenic emission of CO2 into the atmosphere. An alternative land-use, namely extractive reserves for forest residents, may serve as one means of using Amazonian forests sustainably and of maintaining carbon in living matter rather than adding it to that in the atmosphere. In the Seringal (former rubber estate) Porongaba (6,800 ha) of the Chico Mendes Extractive Reserve, Acre, Brazil, primary forest still covers more than 90% of the area. Total biomass in primary forest is estimated at 426 tons per ha, equivalent to 213 t C per ha. Rubber tappers effectively maintain about 60,000 tons of carbon per household (family unit) in forest biomass and thus out of the atmosphere. Deforestation of primary forest was less than 0.6% per yr — much less than rates of natural disturbances for other neotropical forests. Slash-and-burn agriculture in the Seringal Porongaba releases carbon at a gross rate of some 200 t C per yr per household. Net releases are much less, as regrowth forests absorb carbon at rates of about 9 t C per ha per yr. The net areal flux of carbon to the atmosphere from land-use in Seringal is much less than one ton of carbon per ha per yr, which is equivalent to less than 0.3% per yr of the carbon stock in forest biomass. If Seringal Porongaba is typical of the three million hectares in extractive reserves in Brazilian Amazonia, then these reserves are calculated to retain 0.6 Gigatons of carbon in the terrestrial biota. Adverse changes in income patterns for rubber tappers could lead to abandonment of extractive reserves or increased deforestation within them. Diversification and improvement of income from non-timber forest products are needed to maintain rubber tappers in extractive reserves. Most beneficiaries of carbon storage in these and other reserves live outside Brazil; devising means of recompensation for these benefits is a challenge for the global society. © 1992, Foundation for Environmental Conservation.

AB  - Soil nutrient concentration generally was independent of age or prior intensity of use in 13 pastures in the E Amazon near Paragominas, Para, Brazil. Pasture use has a significant effect on soil nutrient concentration when the sites are first abandoned, but this does not persist. Nutrient uptake by successional vegetation may substantially reduce soil nutrient stocks. Nutrient depletion of pastures abandoned 8 yr previously relative to total nutrient stocks in mature forest depended on pasture disturbance. Sites previously subjected to low use were only depleted of N, moderate-use sites were depleted of N and K, and heavy-use sites were depleted of N, K, Mg and possibly Ca and P. There was less nutrient depletion than the relatively small biomass of the successional sites would indicate, due to a higher proportion of nutrient-rich leaves and fine branches, enriched soil nutrient stocks relative to mature forest and, on the lightly disturbed sites, a large pool of nutrients in unburned woody residue. Decomposition of unburned woody residue may provide 50% of the nutrients taken up by vegetation during 8 yr of recovery following light pasture use, but only 15% following moderate use, and none following the most intense use. Recovery after disturbance is complex, and follows different patterns depending on the intensity of pasture use. (See also 90L/00420). -from Authors

AB  - A comparative study was performed in the Oriental Amazon region of Brazil, on an experimental area of yellow latosol and red-yellow podzolic soils. Taking the forest soil as a reference, the chemical, physical, and micromorphological changes occurring after sequential burning, tillage and fallow-land were studied. Deforestation and tillage were responsible for a decreasing content and qualitative changes in organic matter; fulvic acid content first increased, then humic acid content decreased, giving rise to an increasing destruction of clay/organic complexes in the A horizon. As a result, a greater dispersion and migration of fine particles occurred, causing the obstruction of macropores and an increase in bulk density. Crop production decreased in two years, and the soil had to be abandoned. A secondary vegetation developed, and yielded organic residues which stimulated faunal activity. After three years under fallow, the above observed soil degradation processes were partially reversed. © 1991.

AB  - The socioeconomic and ecological aspects of landuse change are interrelated, especially in the Brazilian Amazon, where immigrants are rapidly cutting the forest to establish farms. A computer simulation has been developed that projects land‐use changes, carbon release, and the time a family can remain on a farm lot as a function of initial soil and vegetation conditions, market and road infrastructure, and decision variables. The model simulates extremes of land‐use practices and typical land‐use conditions for central Rondônia, Brazil. Typical land‐use practices in Rondônia are based on published accounts of farmers’ activities. The most severe practices are defined based on extreme land management conditions along the Transamazon Highway. The best land‐use practices are innovative farming techniques that use a diversity of perennial crops. Model projections using the typical land‐use scenario produce changes in land cleared, carbon release, and farmer turnover rates representative of central Rondônia, based on interviews with 87 farmers. Results from both the model projections and the interview data show that farmers who have been on the lots a decade have cleared about half of the lot. The most striking result is the similarity in the typical and worst‐case scenarios over the 40‐year projection period in the percentage of land cleared and carbon released and in the number of families on the farm lots and abandoning the lots over time. Model results from the best‐case scenario compare well to the three farmers out of 87 interviewed who practice innovative farming. In both cases, farmers who have been on their land an average of eight years have deforested less than 20% of the lot. Spatial indices of fractal dimension and contagion are used to quantify the effects of the different land‐management practices. Changes in the fractal index over the 40 years of projected land management demonstrate the decrease in complexity as a forested region becomes dominated by agriculture for the typical and worst‐case scenarios. Low values of the contagion index indicates that a heterogeneous mix of land uses is retained with the best‐case scenario. These results suggest that crop diversity and nontraditional techniques provide both a social and environmental improvement over the other scenarios: the people are able to maintain themselves on the land, less carbon is released, and the land maintains a mix of habitat types. The model results illustrate that both social and environmental effects of land‐management practices need to be considered. Copyright © 1994, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved; Los aspectos socio‐economicós y ecológicos del cambio en el uso de la tiera están inter‐relacionados, especialmente en la Amazonía Brasilera dónde los inmigrantes estan cortando rápidamente la selva para establecer terrenos agrícolas. Se ha desarrollado una simulación que proyecta los cambios en el uso de la tierra, las emisiones de carbono y el tiempo que una familia puede quedarse en un terreno agrícola en función de las condiciones iniciales del suelo y la vegetación, el mercado y la infraestructura de rutas y las variables de decisión. El modelo simula tanto condiciones extremas como típicas en las prácticas del uso de la tierra en Rondônia central, Brasil. Las prácticas típicas del uso de la tierra en Rondônia, están basadas en actividades de los agricultores que se encuentran publicadas. Las prácticas más severas son definidas en base a condicìones extremas de manejo de la tierra a lo largo de la ruta. Transamasónica. Las mejores prácticas de uso de la tierra son técnicas de cultivo innovadoras que utilizan una diversidad de cultivos peremnes. Las proyecciones del modelo que utiliza el caso de uso de la tierra típico produce cambios en tierras desmon tadas, emisiones de carbono y tasas de recambio de los agricultores que son representativas de Rondônia central, basadas en los datos de encuestas llevadas a cabo entre ochenta y siete agricultores. Tanto los resultados de las proyecciones del modelo como de las encuestas muestran que los agricultores que han estado en el lote por una década han desmontado alrededor de la mitad del mismo. El resultado más sorprendente es ta similitud entre el caso típico y el peor en el período de cuarenta años de la proyección con respecto al porcentaje de tierra desmontada y carbono emitido y el número de familias que permanecian en los lotes de terrenos agrícolas y aquellas que los abandonaban, a través del tiempo. El resultado del modelo para el mejor caso se ajusta bien a tres, de los ochenta y siete agricultores encuestados, que practican agricultura innovadora. En ambos casos, los agricultores que han estado en su tierra un promedio de ocho años han deforestado menos del 20% del lote. Indices espaciales de dimensión fractal y de contagio son utilizados para cuantificar el efecto de las diferentes prácticas de manejo de la tierra. Cambios en el índice de dimensión fractal en el período proyectado de 40 años de manejo de la tierra, demuestra el decrecimiento en complejidad en la medida en que la región forestada es dominada por agricultura para el caso típico y para el peor caso. Bajos valores del indice de contagio indican que una mezcla heterogénea de usos de la tierra es retenida en el mejor de los casos. Estos resultados sugieren que, comparado con los otros casos, la diversidad del cultivo y las técnicas no tradicionales proveen un ambiente social y ambiental de mejoras: los pobladores son capaces de mantenerse por ellos mismos en la tierra, una menor cantidad de carbono es emitida y las tierras mantienen una mezcla de tipos de hábitat. Los resultados del modelo ilustran que se deben considerar tanto los efectos sociales como los del ambiente en las prácticas de manejo de la tierra.

AB  - Forests of the world sequester and conserve more C than all other terrestrial ecosystems and account for 90% of the annual C flux between the atmosphere and the Earth's land surface. Preliminary estimates indicate that forest and agroforest management practices throughout the world can enhance the capability of forests to sequester C and reduce accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Yet of the 3600 × 106 ha of forests in the world today, only about 10% (350×106 ha) are actively managed. The impetus to expand lands managed for forestry or agroforestry purposes lies primarily with nations having forest resources. In late 1990, an assessment was initiated to evaluate the biological potential and initial site costs of managed forest and agroforest systems to sequester C. Within the assessment, 12 key forested nations were the focus of a special analysis: Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Germany, India, Malaysia, Mexico, South Africa, former USSR, and USA. These nations contain 59% of the world's natural forests and are representative of the world's boreal, temperate, and tropical forest biomes. Assessment results indicate that though the world's forests are contained in 138 nations, a subset of key nations, such as the 12 selected for this analysis, can significantly contribute to the global capability to sequester C through managed tree crops. Collectively, the 12 nations are estimated to have the potential to store 25.7 Pg C, once expanded levels of practices such as reforestation, afforestation, natural regeneration and agroforestry are implemented and maintained. Initial site costs based upon establishment costs for management practices are less than US$33/Mg C. © 1993 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

AB  - Some 388 herbaceous plant species, excepting epiphytes, were collected belonging to 64 families and 182 genera, 330 species are terrestrial, 34 aquatic; the others have an intermediate status. Only 17 species formed large monospecific stands. The largest number of species (273) was found during the dry phase in disturbed areas on the levees, as for instance in abandoned fields, because of a reduced impact of the flood and high light intensity. Low numbers were recorded during low water period from the floor of floodplain forest (25) because of insufficient light conditions and from low lying lake beds (26), which were dominated by a few highly adapted species. -from Authors

AB  - Despite the fact that by 1980 Brazil's external debt approached US$100 billion and the effects of economic crisis were strongly felt, the government attempted to continue with previously launched integrated regional development projects including the "Polonoroeste" program. 3 phases were foreseen for the project, in Rondonia, Mato Grosso, and in new colonization zones. The goals of the Rondonia and Mato Grosso phases were to establish agriculture in the Amazon basin zone covered by the Polonoroeste, where the soils were reported to be of good or average quality although extremely heterogeneous over small areas. To avoid danger of rapid and complete deforestation, each colonist was to receive 100 hectares, 5 of which would be cleared and planted each year, allowing the forest to regenerate over 20 years. Colonists were expected to preserve 50 hectares of forest in their 100 hectare lots, but with increasing numbers of colonists the tendency has been to cut back the forest. Colonists were to receive credits and low interest loans repayable beginning 5 years after settlement over a period of 15 years. Since loans were not indexed, the amounts due would be a very small proportion of their initial worth in Brazil's inflationary economy. Boundary disputes sometimes resulting in armed conflict or murder have occurred in both Rondonia and especially in Mato Grosso between legal settlers and squatters, and between different categories of settlers. More serious has been the settlers' resentment and contesting of the large reserves set aside for the indigenous population, which has declined precipitously in recent years, probably as the result of massacres. In Mato Grosso, inequality in land holdings is demonstrated by the control over 55% of the land exercised by 1% of landholders. The demographic response to the colonization schemes was overwhelming. The populations of Rondonia and Mato Grosso respectively were estimated at 36,935 and 522,044 in 1950, 69,792 and 889,539 in 1960, 111,064 and 1,597,090 in 1970, and 490,153 and 2,506,063 in 1980. Since 1980, the rate of population growth has been 8%/year in Mato Grosso and over 16% in Rondonia, due primarily to immigration. Estimates of the rate of abandonment range from 10%-30%, with ill heath the main reason for departing. Malaria is rampant, especially in Rondonia, and other diseases also take their toll, while health services are inadequate. The extreme poverty of many settlers, exacerbated by economic problems, difficulty of clearing the forest and transporting goods, hard work, psychological and social difficulties brought on by isolation and loneliness and the lack of conveniences, and feelings of insecurity due to frequent clashes with Indians may be other reasons for leaving. It is too early for a definitive assessment of the successes and failures of the Polonoroeste project, but it is at least clear that Amazon settlement cannot be a permanent solution for Brazil's rapid population growth and related problems.

AB  - Deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon was less than 1% before 1975. Between 1975 and 1987 the rate increased exponentially. By 1985, world opinion and attention to the destruction of the richest biome on earth led to elimination of some of the major incentives that had fueled deforestation. Favorable credit policies for cattle ranchers, rather than population growth, explains the process of deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon. The paper suggests other actions that may be taken to reduce deforestation, and examines the rapid growth rates of secondary successional species in a colonization area. © 1993 Plenum Publishing Corporation.

AB  - The land uses that now predominate in Brazil's Amazon Region are unlikely to produce sustainable yields. They also tend to close off potentially sustainable alternative uses. Cattle pasture - either productive or abandoned - now occupies most deforested land. Small farmers plant pasture after using the land for a year or two under annual crops, while large cattle ranches plant pasture directly after clearing. The principal motive for planting pasture is often its low cost and high effectiveness as a means of securing speculative land claims - not beef production. Pasture and cattle yields are low and, after use for about a decade, the planted grasses are out-competed by secondary forest species or inedible grasses. Depletion of available phosphorus in the soil is a major cause of yield decline; Brazil's relatively modest phosphorus deposits, virtually all of which are outside of Amazonia, make fertiliser use not feasible for the vast areas now rapidly being converted to pasture. Converting a substantial portion of Amazonia to pasture would have potential climatic effects. Areas that can be planted in annual and perennial crops are restrained by world markets, as well as by soil quality and Brazil's limited stocks of the inputs needed for intensive agriculture. Recent initiatives for "agricultural-ecological in Brazil's Amaoznian states could be a first step toward more rational land use. Immediate measures are needed to slow deforestation, to discourage unsustainable uses and to make sustainable alternatives profitable. © 1988 Science And Technology Letters.

AB  - Land use and land cover features of a 3,000 sq. km. area west of Altamira, State of Para, Brazil, along the Transamazon Highway was assessed using three dates of Landsat TM data acquired for late July/early August 1985, 2988, and 1991. These data, supplemented by field observations and interviews with land users conducted in 1992, permitted classification of nine features, including three of secondary succession (SS). The research emphasis focused on developing multitemporal field level information through remote sensing that could be used to help assess SS characteristics vital in understanding the area dynamics and processes. Research results indicate that multitemporal TM data can be used successfully to identify three SS land cover classes and their rates of change. Classification accuracy of the features of interest varied from 81 to 98 percent. Information developed from analysis of the classifications included delineation of several patterns of different speeds or rates of SS, rate and spatial nature of deforestation from 1985–1991, and SS areas spectrally nearing or achieving mature moist forest signatures. © 1993 Taylor and Francis Ltd.

AB  - People who live from tropical forests alter populations of plant and animal species and may change forest structure and function. How does the biotic impoverishment associated with non-timber forest product (NTFP) extraction compare to that resulting from cattle ranching and selective timber harvesting, the principal land-use alternatives to extraction? Drawing on Brazilian case studies from Acre (NTFP extraction) and northeastern Para (ranching and logging), we compare the ecological impacts of these three land uses and conclude that biotic impoverishment associated with them is qualitatively similar but quantitatively distinct. Each land use reduces populations of native plant and animal species and reduces mature forest cover. Forest conversion to pasture, practiced by both ranchers and, to a lesser extent, NTFP extractors, clearly provokes the greatest biotic impoverishment of the activities discussed, for it can virtually eliminate the native biota, reduces carbon storage in biomass, alters hydrology and, potentially, provokes regional climate change. For NTFP extraction to succeed as a conservation/development strategy, extractor populations will require reliable sources of income that reduce the attractiveness of pasture formation. Once organized, extractor groups may increase income by marketing new NTFPs and enriching abandoned agricultural plots with economically valuable trees. -from Authors

AB  - Results of peridomiciliary and forest environment mosquito catches are presented. By using the method single host, mosquitoes were identified according to blood-meal and thus their dispersal was observed. Evidence was obtained for movements of Aedes scapularis, due apparently were appetential flights, as well as its permanence in peridomiciliar resting places. Occurrence in domestic animal shelters was recorded for this species. Peridomiciliar human bait catches showed regular occurrence of Ae. scapularis, Anopheles bellator, An. cruzii and Culex sacchettae, but anophelines abandoned the human environment for the surrounding forest. Feeding index showed clearly a preference on the part of Ae. scapularis for bovine hosts. The peridomiciliar frequency of Cx. sacchettae suggests a domiciliary tendency. The influence of large domestic animals in the human environment surrounded by primitive Atlantic plain forests, on the domiciliation of the sylvatic mosquitoes, is emphasized.

AB  - This article comes from a paper presented at the UNESCO-IVIC International Workshop on rain forest regeneration and management held in November, 1986 in Venezuela. It reviews FAO and other studies which indicate that protective management of many humid lowland forests is both technically feasible and economically viable. Considers natural forest management - ie controlled and regulated harvesting - combined with silvicultural and protective measures to sustain or increase the commercial value of subsequent areas all relying on natural regeneration of native species. Includes studies of Malaysia, Philippines, Brazil, Peru, Colombia, Ecuador, Suriname, Costa Rica and French Guiana; looks at forest harvesting in Africa; problems and opportunities in implementing a natural system of forest management. Concludes that in a model management programme negative ecological impacts of harvesting or alternative land use can be minimized. -from Author

AB  - Ranching and logging operations are transforming the moist tropical forests of an eastern Amazonian landscape into a mosaic of pastures and regrowth forests. The new ecosystems of this region are agriculturally unproductive, biologically impoverished, and far more flammable than the mature forests they replace. In the absence of fire, the forest regrows on abandoned sites, accumulating biomass and species at a rate that is inversely related to the intensity of use prior to abandonment. Forest regrows slowest on those rare abandoned pastures that were once scraped with bulldozers. The grass- and shrub-dominated old fields that form on some of these sites resist forest regrowth because of numerous barriers to tree establishment and growth. Knowledge of these barriers provides a basis for developing inexpensive techniques to restore agricultural productivity in old fields by implanting tree-based agricultural systems or to restore forest regenerative capacity in old fields by establishing trees that attract seed-carrying animals and ameliorate harsh environmental conditions. These restoration techniques will be needed over large areas of Amazonia if current attempts to reform degraded pastures fail. -from Authors
