Abstract = {Our aim was to evaluate whether the richness and composition of anurans
   responded to the time of forest regeneration via secondary succession.
   We sampled the anuran community in a mosaic of areas at three different
   stages of secondary succession in the Atlantic Forest, southern Brazil.
   The anurans were collected from nine lentic ponds and from their margins
   up to a 50 m radius. The late secondary forest sheltered the higher
   species richness, followed by the primary forest. The spatial variation
   in species richness was related to the forest succession stage and
   predominance of arboreal vegetation on the pond edge. The species
   composition changed throughout the succession stages, regardless of the
   distance among areas. Along the gradient of forest succession,
   environmental changes have driven species distribution, limiting the
   occurrence of forest species and favoring the colonization of areas at
   the early succession stage by opportunist species. We could observe that
   the secondary forest succession was a determining factor in the anuran
   community structure, and with the advancement of the secondary
   succession, both richness and composition were partly restored. Thus,
   the conservation of secondary forests might be an efficient strategy to
   preserve the biodiversity in areas of the Atlantic Forest.},

Abstract = {In the present work, we aimed to evaluate successional forest stage and
   horizontal, vertical and diametric structures of upper and under strata
   on a secondary forest stretch under Araucaria angustifolia on the
   Bananal Ecological Station, Sao Paulo state, Brazil. During upper
   stratum survey (circumference at breast height (CBH) >= 15 cm), 43
   permanent plots of 10 x 20 m were established. In each plot, five
   sub-plots of 1 x 1 m were randomly allocated for under stratum (total
   height >= 30 cm and CBH < 15 cm) survey. Regarding upper stratum,
   density and dominance were estimated on 2142 ind./ha and 32.49 m(2)/ha,
   respectively, in absolute total values. Concerning under stratum, total
   absolute density was estimated on 48,302 ind./ha. The diametric
   structure of the community follows the J-invert pattern, which was not
   observed for Brazilian Pine population, compromising its maintenance in
   the community. The auto-ecology of the species supports the catalyzation
   of secondary succession under its crown, which was classified at middle
   successional stage.},

Abstract = {The natural regeneration in forest environments is dynamic, variable in
   space and time and it is in the development cycle of forests. In
   seasonal tropical forests, due to seasonal climatic changes, natural
   regeneration depends mainly on availability of soil moisture, which
   affects patterns of seed production and germination, survival and
   development of seedling as well. The objective of this study was to
   analyze the dynamics of natural regeneration in a seasonal semideciduous
   secondary forest in Pirenopolis, Goias, Brazil, by analyzing the changes
   in floristic composition of seedlings and small trees over time and
   relating them to environmental factors of plots in the study area by
   using Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA). The results indicated
   that seedlings were more dynamic than small trees mainly because of
   climate. This occurred because of the greater susceptibility of the
   seedling to soil water stress and the increase of solar radiation and
   temperature in the dry season. It was found a high floristic similarity
   (+/- 50\%) among population of natural regeneration and the tree
   community, indicating an advanced stage of natural regeneration of the
   forest, with Diversity Index higher than 3.0 nats.indv(-1). Canonical
   Correspondence Analysis grouped the species according to the
   environmental gradient of moisture and shade versus soil cover, placing
   near to each other, species of humid environments versus species of
   typical cerrado dry environments.},

Abstract = {Ecological succession is a complex process involving mainly some changes
   in the structure of plant community, with subsequent changes in resource
   availability as well as in the interactions among organisms which are
   also important factors determining the structure of arboreal ant
   assemblages, but little is known about the consequences of secondary
   succession on ant assemblages in Tropical Dry Forests (TDFs), such as
   the Brazilian Caatinga. Here we investigate the effects of ecological
   succession on the richness and species composition of arboreal ants in
   fragments of Caatinga, testing the following hypothesis: i) the species
   richness of arboreal ants increases along a gradient of secondary
   succession, in response to habitat complexity and season; ii) species
   composition of arboreal ants differs among stages of secondary
   succession due to differences in vegetation structure in theses stages
   and seasonality. This study was conducted in 15 plots distributed in
   three areas with different stages of secondary succession (early,
   intermediate and late). Tree species richness and density were used as
   surrogates of habitat complexity. Ants were sampled using the technique
   of beating the foliage and baited pitfall traps, where five trees were
   sampled per plot, totaling 75 individual trees sampled. We sampled 37
   species of ants, distributed in 16 genera and five subfamilies. Ant
   species richness differed among stages of succession and seasons, with
   higher number of species in the late succession and rainy period, also
   increasing with habitat complexity. We conclude that the structure of
   arboreal ants assemblage was related to ecological succession of
   vegetation, mainly in the rainy season. Fifteen years of secondary
   regeneration are enough to increase species richness and maybe to
   restore species composition of arboreal ants but secondary habitats are
   also important to biodiversity maintenance of this group in Caatinga.},

Abstract = {Surveys were undertaken to examine the floristic changes during
   secondary succession in three areas of 12 and three of 20-year-old
   secondary forests in Pernambuco State, Brazil. Two hundred and six
   species were identified, with 136 being found in the 12-year-old
   secondary forest and 161 species in the 20-year-old forest. Fabaceae and
   Myrtaceae were the most important families, increasing in species
   numbers with regeneration age. Of the 216 species, 115 were trees, 48
   shrubs, 16 herbaceous plants, and 24 woody lianas, without significant
   differences between the two regeneration site ages. NMDS analysis
   revealed a formation of two floristic groups, distinguishing secondary
   and mature forests, with a further division within secondary forests in
   accordance with the time since abandonment. Similarity analysis ANOSIM
   confirmed the significance of the groups, which had floristic
   composition significant distinct (R=0.96) and 63\% of dissimilarity
   (SIMPER). However, the sharing of 68 arboreal species between the
   secondary and mature forests suggests a floristic convergence. DCA
   analysis of the arboreal component as well as the other plant habits
   suggested that the separation of the subgroups is correlated with
   physical and chemical variables of the soils. All of these results
   indicate that, within the chronosequence analyzed, the velocity and
   direction of the floristic composition during secondary succession was
   influenced not only by the time of their abandonment, but also by a wide
   range of environmental variables.},

Abstract = {Vegetation plays a central role in controlling terrestrial carbon (C)
   exchange, but quantifying its impacts on C cycling on time scales of
   ecological succession is hindered by a lack of long-term observations.
   The net ecosystem exchange of carbon (NEE) was measured for several
   years in adjacent ecosystems that represent distinct phases of
   ecological succession in the southeastern USA. The experiment was
   designed to isolate the role of vegetation - apart from climate and
   soils - in controlling biosphere-atmosphere fluxes of CO2 and water
   vapor. NEE was near zero over 5 years at an early successional old-field
   ecosystem (OF). However, mean annual NEE was nearly equal, approximately
   -450 g C m(-2) yr(-1), at an early successional planted pine forest (PP)
   and a late successional hardwood forest (HW) due to the sensitivity of
   the former to drought and ice storm damage. We hypothesize that these
   observations can be explained by the relationships between gross
   ecosystem productivity (GEP), ecosystem respiration (RE) and canopy
   conductance, and long-term shifts in ecosystem physiology in response to
   climate to maintain near-constant ecosystem-level water-use efficiency
   (EWUE). Data support our hypotheses, but future research should examine
   if GEP and RE are causally related or merely controlled by similar
   drivers. At successional time scales, GEP and RE observations generally
   followed predictions from E. P. Odum's `Strategy of Ecosystem
   Development', with the surprising exception that the relationship
   between GEP and RE resulted in large NEE at the late successional HW. A
   practical consequence of this research suggests that plantation forestry
   may confer no net benefit over the conservation of mature forests for C
   sequestration.},

Abstract = {Natural regeneration is becoming more frequently used on a global level

   objective of this study was to investigate forest restoration as a
   function of the exclusive use of natural regeneration in systems with
   two (NR2) and seven (NR7) years of age after bauxite mining in Eastern
   Amazon, Brazil (3 degrees 14' 51 `'-3 degrees 15' 48 `' S and 47 degrees

   fertility), landscape-level quantification of vegetation in the areas
   surrounding the study sites and attributes of the established vegetation
   (abundance of individuals and families, Shannon diversity index,
   evenness index, and ecological dominance index) were assessed. The
   method of natural regeneration, in seven years, was efficient to occupy
   and cover the soil by regenerating tree and shrub species, as well to
   contribute to the recovery of important surface-depth attributes of the
   quality of rebuilt soils, such as organic matter, nutrient availability,
   density, porosity, and water infiltration. The regenerating tree and
   shrub species had low diversity and high dominance of a few pioneer

Abstract = {This study aimed to understand post-agricultural natural forest
   regeneration in the Southern Brazilian Atlantic Forest and its possible
   role as a cost-effective, passive approach to forest restoration. The
   study characterized vegetation structure, floristic composition, and the
   dynamics of secondary forest chronosequences. Data were collected from
   159 plots (10 x 10 m each) across forest remnants in Santa Catarina
   State, covering forest ages that ranged from 2 to 60 years of
   regeneration after swidden agriculture. Only areas with no signs of
   degradation were sampled in order to provide a description of vegetation
   characteristics that could be used to identify and monitor natural
   regeneration. A total of 11,455 woody plants were identified and
   classified into 334 species representing 71 families. As the succession
   process unfolds, the continuous turnover of species makes forests more
   diverse and structurally complex. Floristic similarity among forest
   types is observed during the early stages of succession, but decreases
   over time. Pioneer species dominate young secondary forests,
   representing about 40\% of the basal area up to 10 years of
   regeneration. Shade-tolerant species start colonizing the sites at early
   ages; however, they become more important structural elements only after
   30 years of succession. The observed patterns of forest structure and
   species diversity largely conform to the post-agricultural succession
   seen in many tropical forests. The high species diversity found in this
   study highlights the importance of natural regeneration as a strategy to
   restore ecosystems. Floristic data can be used as a reference for
   choosing suitable species for active restoration, as well as
   contributing to the design of integrated restoration strategies. We
   herein reinforce the potential of natural regeneration as part of
   large-scale restoration programs, which would be particularly attractive
   to family farmers by the low cost of supplies and labor.},

Abstract = {Pasture soils in the Amazon become unsustainable after a short period of
   use, typically being replaced by emergent secondary vegetation
   (capoeira). The aim of this research was to investigate the
   photosynthetic capacity and water use in the most common tree species
   (Vismia japurensis, Vismia cayennensis, Bellucia grossularioides, Laetia
   procera, and Goupia glabra) in successional chronosequence. This study
   was carried out in secondary vegetation area with ages that vary between
   1 and 19 years. Responses of gas exchange were determined during
   different periods of precipitation. The gas exchange decreased with
   advancing age of the vegetation (1-19 years), except for G. glabra.
   Negative relationships of P (Nmax) as a function of aging observed for
   V. japurensis, V. cayennensis, B. grossularioides, and L. procera
   exhibited r (2) equal to 0.59, 0.42, 0.33, and 0.58, respectively. The
   species of Vismia showed higher values for photosynthetic parameters in
   relation to other species across the chronosequence. Overall, there were
   differences in gas exchange only for some species between the different
   periods of precipitation. Therefore, our results suggest a distinct
   pattern of photosynthetic responses to species in early succession.
   Light decrease can exert a decisive role to reduce the photosynthetic
   rates in secondary succession species. On the other hand, the results of
   WUE showed weak evidence of changes for the species during dry and rainy
   periods in the abandoned pasture in central Amazonia.},

Abstract = {The objective of this work was to compare a natural regeneration of two
   areas with Caatinga vegetation with different histories of use in the
   Agreste of Pernambuco. These studies were carried out in two areas: Area
   I, native forest, with no historical evidences of deforestation for
   agriculture purposes; and Area II, which was previously occupied with
   the cultivation of forage cactus and was abandoned about 30 years ago at
   the stage of secondary succession. For data collection, it was used a
   total of 24 plots of 5 x 5 in dimensions, 12 plots in each area, and
   considering the plants with circumference at breast height (CBH) of 1.30
   m from ground (CAP) < 6.0 cm and height >= 1.0 in as individuals in
   natural regeneration. It was identified in the structure survey of
   regenerating individuals structural survey in both areas, 581 plants of
   14 botanical families, 26 genus and 30 species. The total densities
   obtained in this study were 11,200 and 8,116 individuals.ha-I in Area
   land II, respectively. The species with the greatest densities of
   natural regeneration in Area I were the following: Croton argyrophyllus,
   Senegalia bahiensis, Croton blanchetianus and Coutarea hexandra and in
   the Area II: Senegalia bahiensis Poincianella pyramidalis, Zanthoxyllum

Abstract = {This study estimates the aboveground biomass accumulation after forest
   clearing and slash burning and describes the structure and successional
   development of the secondary forest in the seasonally dry southern
   Amazon. The original burn study was conducted in four land clearings in
   1997, 1998, and 1999. The size of the clearings varied from 1 to 9 ha.
   The native forest was felled, allowed to dry for approximately three
   months and then burned by the end of the dry season. A census was
   conducted in the central 1-ha forest on each site prior to the area's
   felling and burn. The aboveground biomass (AGB) and structure were
   similar to other primary tropical forests. However, the high density of
   Cecropia spp. before the forest felling and burn treatment indicates
   past low intensity disturbances. Seven and eight years after the fire,
   the fallow forests were still in an early successional stage dominated
   by Cecropia spp. The four areas had a high biomass accumulation during
   the studied period, varying from 7.5 to 15.0 Mg ha(-1) year(-1). The
   lower biomass accumulation in one plot was an effect of a higher fire
   severity, produced by the one-year difference in time between slash and
   burn of the forest, slowing the natural regeneration of Cecropia spp.
   The time needed for this forest to recover to the pre-fire AGB levels
   ranged from 20 to 30 years, assuming the current AGB accumulation rates
   are maintained. Considering these results, the maintenance of
   regenerating secondary forests in the Amazon would be a significant
   contribution to soil and watershed protection, minimizing biodiversity
   losses and perhaps mitigating climatic changes effects in the region.

Abstract = {Replacing the Brazilian Atlantic Forest by pastures has caused a strong

   structural and functional changes in the early succession. The abandoned
   pastures (by periods of 8, 14, 48, 50 and 96 months) were colonized
   mainly by trees, animal-dispersed and pioneer species. The data showed
   that the forest structure was quickly changed with an increase in tree
   abundance, stem volume and species richness. It indicates that in low
   fragmented landscapes, such as the northern littoral of Parana State,
   the resilience of the Atlantic Forest is relatively high and assisted
   regeneration may be an option to biodiversity conservation strategies.},

Abstract = {Ecologically relevant restoration of secondary Atlantic forest on
   abandoned land offers a potential means to recover biodiversity and
   improve crucial ecosystem services, including carbon sequestration.
   Early secondary successional trajectories are determined by a range of
   environmental factors that influence plant community development.
   Context-specific understanding of forest vegetation communities, their
   dynamics, and underlying drivers is needed for future restoration
   strategies. In this study we examined relationships between soil
   (chemical and physical) and environmental (landscape and topographical)
   characteristics, plant community attributes, and carbon stocks during
   early secondary succession. Data were collected at two sites undergoing
   early secondary succession in seasonally-dry Atlantic Forest (Rio de
   Janeiro State, Brazil). Both sites were previously used for pasture and
   abandoned at similar times, but showed differing vegetation communities.
   We found tree biomass and diversity and ecosystem carbon storage to be
   strongly positively related to the amount of surrounding forest, less
   steep slopes and clay soils, and negatively to the abundance of the
   shrub Leandra aurea. Soil carbon pools significantly increased with
   aboveground tree biomass. The only factor significantly affecting the
   metric of overall successional development (combining tree biomass and
   diversity) was total surrounding forest cover. Our findings suggest
   recovery of secondary forest and below-and aboveground carbon storage is
   limited by the amount of adjacent forest, some soil properties and dense
   shrub establishment down-regulating the succession process. Overall we
   offer evidence of potential to improve recovery of Atlantic forest with
   ecologically relevant seeding/planting programmes and selective shrub
   removal that could benefit ecosystem carbon storage.},

Abstract = {Comparative studies between different strata of forests in ecological
   succession are important to understand the forest dynamics. The study
   evaluated floristic, phytosociological and ecological aspects between
   the tree and regenerating strata of an urban fragment of semideciduous
   forest, in Jatai, Goias state. In the last decades, the vegetation that
   was typically savanna has become a forest. Trees (diameter at breast
   height, DBH >= 5 cm) were sampled in 12 permanent 200m(2) plots. In each
   of them, 25m(2) subplots were sampled for the regenerant stratum, which
   comprised individuals with DBH <5cm and height >= 1m. Regenerants had
   greater richness (31 species), with two more species than adults. There
   was low floristic and structural similarity between the strata,
   indicating a replacement of species over time. Shannon's diversity was
   significantly lower for the tree stratum (t test), since it presented
   low equability, with ecological dominance of few species. Both strata
   had a high proportion of pioneer species, when compared to other
   studies. Zoochory and species of forest environments were significantly
   more abundant in the regenerating stratum. The study revealed a fragment
   in a frank process of secondary succession and vulnerability in the face
   of anthropic pressures, with care regarding its conservation being
   important.},

Pages = {333-341},
Abstract = {Ecological succession is one of the most important processes in forest
   ecosystems, still poorly understood in the highland Araucaria forests of
   Southern Brazil. Here we investigated this process by describing
   functional composition changes in response to a vegetation successional
   mosaic in four forest fragments in the municipality of Urubici, State of
   Santa Catarina, Brazil. Two fragments were classified as in advanced
   stage of succession and two were classified in early stage. The
   following functional traits were determined: wood density, leaf area,
   specific leaf area, dispersal syndrome and leaf phenology. For each
   fragment, we determined the community weighted mean (CWM) and the
   functional diversity (RaoQ). Data were analyzed by descriptive
   statistics, t and Mann-Whitney tests and Principal Components Analysis.
   We found that the successional stage is a relevant source of functional
   heterogeneity. At the advanced-successional stage, tree communities have
   harder woods, more membranous and semi-deciduous leaves and higher
   functional diversity. Conversely, at the early successional stages,
   forests have softer wood, more coriaceous leaves and lower functional
   diversity. We concluded that the studied forests showed a high
   functional composition heterogeneity, partially determined by a
   successional mosaic. While perennial species with lower values of
   specific leaf area and wood density predominated in the early
   successional areas, semi-deciduous species with higher values of
   specific leaf area and wood density prevailed in the late successional
   ones.},

Journal = {ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {172},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Shrubs of the Psychotria L. (Rubiaceae) genus can occur like a dominant
   species in the understory of subtropical forests. This study aims to
   understand the ecological conditions of Psychotria dominance,
   specifically Psychotria leiocarpa Cham. \& Schltdl. and Psychotria
   carthagenensis Jacq. in the understory, and its relation with natural
   tree regeneration. We sampled 162 plots of 1 m2 in an ecotonal
   Semi-deciduous Seasonal Forest remnant (243.28 ha) in the Pampa biome,
   in Southern Brazil. The analysis considered three habitat-selective
   regimes which occur in the remnant (road-edge, eucalyptus-edge, and
   forest-interior), and environmental variables (air temperature, relative
   humidity, canopy opening, inclination, solar exposition, altitude, and
   ground cover), according to which relationships between Psychotria and
   regenerating trees could be established in a different way. We assumed
   the hypothesis that the dominance of Psychotria shrubs in the understory
   may influence the natural regenerating trees and differ in relation to
   habitat-selective regimes and in function of environmental variables. No
   evidence of effective ecological dominance was found. The results
   indicated regular regeneration density for regenerating trees and for
   Psychotria shrubs. P. leiocarpa was predominant in the regeneration
   community, followed by regenerating trees and P. carthagenensis. In
   addition, P. carthagenensis demonstrated an aggregated behavior, forming
   few groups with high density. The environmental variables influenced the
   composition and/or abundance of the regeneration community and were more
   intense than the habitat-selective regimes. The habitatselective regimes
   mostly acted in P. leiocarpa, which presented less density at the
   road-edge. Our results demonstrate that Psychotria shrub densities do
   not decrease the natural regeneration of trees, thus suggesting that P.
   leiocarpa and P. carthagenensis are multifunctional species which act in
   the understory as filters which favor ecological succession, even in
   different habitat-selective regimes. Therefore, they can be a key tool
   for ecological restoration and conservation, acting as core species in
   strategies to promote succession processes and ecological enrichment.},

Abstract = {Secondary succession on abandoned pastures in the Amazon is
   characterized by low diversity and slow turnover of plant species in the
   early decades. Here we present the results of a 6-year experiment in
   order to evaluate the effects of artificially created forest gaps
   established in 20-year old Vismia-dominated secondary forests in Central
   Amazonia. Plant diversity and composition of trees <= 5 cm DBH were
   assessed in 21,100-m(2) lightgaps evenly distributed in three
   topographic positions (plateau, slope, and bottomland). These empirical
   results were compared with four uncut, control plots nearby the
   experimental plots. There were no topographic effects on plant density
   and species richness for either the two size classes analyzed (seedlings
   <1 cm DBH and saplings 1-5 cm DBH). Irrespective of topographic level,
   tree density varied significantly before and six years after lightgap
   formation, for the both size classes. At six years after gap creation,
   the number of species increased by 30\% for the seedlings, despite of
   the fact that the density declined significantly following creation of
   the lightgaps. As a result, there was a more rapid species accumulation
   than prior to lightgap creation. However, for the saplings the increase
   in species richness could be explained by the increase in the number of
   individuals over the six-year period. There were no significant changes
   in tree density and species richness for either size class for the
   control plots. Species composition diverged greatly from before to six
   years after cutting, for both size classes, as revealed by the NMDS
   ordinations. Moreover, for seedlings there was greater floristic
   similarity among plots before lightgap creation in comparison to evident
   divergence six years later. In contrast, for saplings floristic
   composition among plots was more similar after six years than prior to
   lightgap formation. There was little difference in floristic composition
   before lightgap formation and control plots. Lack of seed dispersal can
   be an important obstacle to natural regeneration of degraded pastures in
   the tropics. However, the lightgaps showed a marked increase in
   old-growth species originating from surrounding mature forests six years
   later. On intensely used sites where succession is slow, small-scale
   disturbance represent a feasible management tool to accelerate natural
   regeneration. Forest regeneration on abandoned pastures will depend on
   the regional pool of species and their successful establishment in
   secondary forest. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

   of forest restoration undertaken by the country. However, trajectories
   of recovery can be highly variable and context-dependent, demanding
   studies to foster the use of secondary forests in restoration. Here, we
   describe the natural recovery of plant diversity in a chronosequence
   (5-21 years old) and how it is influenced by age of the regenerating
   forests. For this, we sampled the floristic composition and structure in
   20 fragments of secondary forest in Southeast Para in 2014 and 2015.
   Transects of either 10 x 250 m or 20 x 125 m (0.25 ha) were delimited in
   each forest fragment, and subdivided into 25 subplots of 10 x 10 m,
   where plants of the upper stratum (DBH >= 10 cm) were sampled. The lower
   stratum (DBH < 10 cm) was sampled in five 5 x 20 m subplots that were
   nested in the 0.25-ha transects. We recorded 5509 individuals of 282
   species and 61 families in the 20 transects evaluated. The species
   diversity recovery occured rapidly in the first few decades of
   ecological succession. Floristic composition of the upper stratum was
   correlated with forest age. Species diversity metrics were predicted by
   the age and basal area of secondary forests, demonstrating their
   importance as indicators of successional stages in secondary forests.
   Our results reinforce the relevance of using secondary forest in
   restoration programmes across the Amazonian region.},

Abstract = {Questions: Secondary succession in the tropics can follow alternative
   pathways. Land-use history is known to engender alternative successional
   communities, but the underlying mechanisms driving and sustaining
   divergence remain unclear. In this study we aim to answer the following
   questions: (1) does previous land use act as a filter for species
   composition in secondary forests; and (2) what are the relative roles of
   management practices, soil properties and landscape composition in
   determining species composition?
   Location: Central Amazon, Brazil.
   Methods: We sampled trees, shrubs and palms (>= 1cm diameter) in 38
   early secondary forests (5 yr after abandonment) located along gradients
   of land-use intensity in five shifting cultivation landscapes. We
   measured the diameter and height of each sampled plant, identified it to
   species or morpho-species level and checked if it was resprouting or
   not. At each secondary forest we also collected soil samples for
   chemical and physical analyses and estimated the amount of old-growth
   forest surrounding it (landscape composition).
   Results: We found that previous land-use intensity determined species
   composition. With increasing land-use intensity, management practices of
   cut-and-burn and associated reduction in soil quality filtered out
   seed-dependent species and favoured strong sprouters and species that
   can cope with low nutrient availability. Landscape composition had a
   weak effect on species assemblages. We found specific species
   assemblages and indicator species associated with different levels of
   previous land-use intensity. As a consequence of these local filters,
   species alpha- and beta-diversity decreased and therefore early
   successional communities became more similar to each other.
   Conclusion: Species composition of successional forests is strongly
   determined by different land-use intensities. Dispersal limitation has a
   limited effect on determining the composition of the dominant species.
   Filtering effects of management practices and soil quality determine the
   species dominating the canopy at early stages of succession and narrow
   down the range of species able to colonize and establish. This study
   highlights how land use shapes successional communities and suggests
   that alternative successional pathways are determined at early stages of
   succession. Therefore, accounting for land-use history is crucial to
   improve the understanding of tropical secondary succession. We present a
   list of indicator species for different levels of previous land-use
   intensity that can be used to support conservation and restoration
   decisions in the Amazon.},

Abstract = {The present study was carried out at Praca de Esportes Forest, located
   on the campus of the Universidade Federal de Vicosa, Vicosa, Minas
   Gerais State. The fragment consists of a 10.65 ha forest in regeneration
   for 75 years. Four parallel transects mesuring 3 x 50 m, spaced 3 m, and
   divided into 10 plots of 3 x 5 m each were set for analysis. Sampling of
   natural regeneration layer included all individuals with height >= 0.3 m
   and DBH < 5 cm. We calculated the phytosociological parameters and
   classified the fragments into successional class and dispersion
   syndrome. The floristic composition was compared with several studies of
   regeneration in Vicosa, through cluster analysis. After analysis, we
   observed the occurrence of 30 families and 84 species, which the most
   important were Coffea arabica, Siparuna guianensis, Psychotria sessilis
   and Erythroxylum pelleterianum. The late secondary successional class
   was the most representative (49.3\% of individuals), and 91.6\% of
   individuals presented dispersion syndrome zoochorous. No floristic
   similarity was observed between the studied area and other forest
   fragments of the region. The predominance of dispersion syndrome
   zoochorous in natural regeneration is an important factor to the
   continued maintenance of frugivorous in the area. The floristic richness
   and abundance of late secondary species are strong indications that the
   environment studied is offering ecological conditions suitable for the
   development of these species, thus allowing the advancement of secondary
   succession.},

Abstract = {Following old-growth forest loss and subsequent land abandonment,
   secondary forest grows throughout the Amazon biome. For Amazonas,
   agricultural colonization was unsuccessful in many regions, leading to
   the regeneration of secondary forest and carbon storage under favorable
   climate conditions. Herein, the extent of regeneration in Amazonas and
   its timescale are investigated, including a granular analysis of its 62
   municipalities, based on the MapBiomas dataset from 1985 to 2021. By
   2021, 10,495 km(2) of secondary forest had grown, corresponding to 28\%
   of the lost old-growth forest. After normalization for algorithmic
   differences, this estimate was 17\%-38\% lower than prior studies for
   Amazonas that used earlier versions of the MapBiomas dataset, indicating
   increased accuracy in landcover assignments for more current versions of
   the dataset. For the northeastern microregion, representing the 15
   municipalities of economic and population dominance in Amazonas, the
   growth of secondary forest varied from 3.0\% to 9.8\% of the total land
   area. For the southern microregion, constituting seven municipalities
   adjacent to large-scale deforestation of Mato Grosso and Rond \&
   ocirc;nia, regeneration of secondary forest constituted 0.4\%-1.2\% of
   the land area. For the remaining interior municipalities, the
   regeneration was 0.0\%-1.9\%. Among the municipalities, the median
   regeneration interval, corresponding to the duration between the loss of
   old-growth forest and the appearance of secondary forest, ranged from 2
   to 7 years. The median regeneration intervals of the interior,
   northeastern, and southern microregions were 3, 4, and 5 years,
   respectively. Even as the secular trend of deforestation continues in
   the Amazon biome and encroaches into the southern border of Amazonas
   state, the results herein indicate a possible resiliency toward
   secondary forest for undisturbed land on a timescale of several years,
   at least for mixed pasture-forest landscapes of kilometer-scale
   heterogeneity and assuming that a favorable climate persists for
   regeneration even as global change occurs.},

Abstract = {This article examines forest change in the Brazilian Amazon in light of
   forest transition theory. We draw on satellite-based land cover data
   matched in a geographic information system (GIS) to census-based social
   and agricultural data for Brazilian municipalities at multiple time
   points. Subregions with distinct settlement histories serve as proxies
   for different stages along the forest transition, theorized to exhibit
   depletion of forest cover, eventually followed by a recovery. Satellite
   images allow for distinctions between primary (old-growth) and secondary
   (successional) forests, but the data indicate more successional forests
   than expected. We argue that biophysical impediments (e.g., poor soils)
   and social obstacles (e. g., capital scarcity) led to limited land
   settlement, low incomes, urbanization, and a shift from crops to
   pasture, resulting in the rapid expansion of secondary forests without
   primary forest depletion. These findings call for refinements in forest
   transition theory that can better account for land cover changes in

Abstract = {The aim of this study was to investigate the spatiotemporal variation in
   richness, abundance, structure and composition of phyllostomid bats over
   a successional gradient in a tropical dry forest in south-eastern
   Brazil. Four successional stages (pasture, early, intermediate and late)
   were sampled in the northern part of the state of Minas Gerais. Bats
   were sampled using mist nets at three sites for each of the four
   successional stages (12 sites in total) during eight periods between
   2007 and 2009. A total of 537 individuals were captured (29 recaptured),
   distributed among four families and 22 species. Bat abundance and
   richness varied in space, being higher in the late-successional stage,
   and over time, being significantly lower during the dry season. When
   compared between guilds, only the abundance of omnivores varied
   significantly during the sampled months. Our results demonstrate that
   areas of late-successional stages showed higher bat richness and
   abundance in comparison with areas undergoing secondary succession. Our
   results also suggest the use of early-successional areas as flying
   routes by bats can lead to failure to detect differences in bat
   composition within successional gradients. We suggest future studies
   should assimilate landscape-level analyses into their studies to better
   evaluate the effects of successional gradients on bat assemblages.},

Abstract = {Bryophytes play an important role in the process of ecological

   subsequent groups. The objective of this study was to investigate the
   distribution of bryophyte communities in a cronossequence in the
   Caxiuana National Forest, Para, Brazil. To this end, biological material
   was collected in forest remnants with different successional stages
   based on regeneration age: Stage I (0 - 10 years), Stage II (10 - 25),
   Stage III (> 25) and Stage IV (primary forests). Density, richness and
   composition of species were compared between successional stages and the
   occurrence of possible indicator-species was investigated. The
   identified taxa were also classified by guilds of tolerance to solar
   radiation and colonized substrate. Composition of species was the
   variable that most contributed to understanding the distribution of
   bryophyte communities throughout successional stages, with eight species
   identified as potential indicators of some successional stages.
   Generalist species predominated in all stages. The richness of sun
   tolerants, in turn, decreased with the progress of succession, while
   shade tolerants increased. The land use history and land cover can
   influence the availability and quality of substrates and consequently
   their colonization by bryophytes in the different stages.},

Abstract = {Forest regeneration in abandoned pastures in Amazonia has been well
   studied, but active restoration o f non- resilient pastures has not. In
   this work, we evaluated large-scale active restoration of intensively
   used pastures in southern Amazonia, where the highest deforestation
   rates are observed. With the construction o f the Jirau Dam in the
   Madeira river (state o f Rondonia, Brazil), a 3000-ha forest buffer zone
   has been established. This area was previously covered by African
   pasture grasses for cattle ranching. Eight mixed-species planting sites
   with variable grass management and ranging from 6 to 60 months
   post-planting were measured three times over 2.5 years. We also tested a
   gradient o f restoration intensity in an experimental planting: (i) no
   intervention (control), (ii) harrowing and herbicides to control
   grasses, and (iii) harrowing and herbicides plus tree planting. Our
   goals were to understand the initial trajectory o f actively restored
   sites, the role of harrowing and herbicide application in triggering
   natural regeneration, and the role of seedling planting on the initial
   vegetation structure. All tree species >= 30 cm in height were sampled
   in five circular 10-m-radius plots per site. Plant cover was also
   monitored using the step-point method. At 18 months, stem density ranged
   from 2500 to 14,490 ind ha(-1), demonstrating that density increased
   suddenly in most sites through colonization, although this was highly
   variable. Tree cover reached 81\% in five years, virtually eliminating
   grass cover after 36 months. Recruits contributed more to basal area
   than planted seedlings. Although 17 species, on average, were planted in
   restoration sites, the number of species at the sites steadily increased
   over time, at a rate of 7 species yr(-1) per 1570 m(2). Cecropia spp.
   and Trema micrantha recruits had the highest stem densities and basal
   areas. Harrowing and grass control were enough to trigger succession in
   sites where natural regeneration was not taking place, shifting these
   sites to the highly resilient route o f early secondary forest
   succession in the Amazon. Future restoration efforts should use a
   combination o f methods, first evaluating the potential for natural

Abstract = {Although commercial forest plantations have been termed ``green
   deserts{''}, several studies from the last two decades have reported the
   opposite. These studies suggest that forest plantations can catalyze the
   natural regeneration in their understory and, thus, contribute to
   biodiversity conservation. In order to obtain a wide and multi-faceted
   panorama of forest plantations and their potential contribution to
   biodiversity conservation and forest restoration, previous studies
   investigating natural regeneration under forest plantations have been
   reviewed, highlighting those carried out in Brazil. Methods and
   environmental conditions are quite variable among studies, making
   generalizations difficult. Nevertheless, results indicate that
   historical and environmental factors, such as canopy density and light
   availability, plantation age, forest species, distance from natural
   forests, silvicultural practices, and previous land use directly or
   indirectly affect natural regeneration richness, abundance and community
   structure under forest plantations. The reviewed studies, as a whole,
   reinforce the idea that commercial forest plantations can act as
   environments of biodiversity, at least for some life forms, and, in
   addition, can facilitate the restoration of native forests. Although the
   Brazilian studies are abundant, they have been restricted to a few
   regions and biomes and are mostly descriptive studies. Experimental
   studies focusing on specific factors that affect the natural
   regeneration dynamic under forest plantations as well as on management
   techniques in order to combine high production and biodiversity
   conservation are desirable. Nonetheless, other biomes and regions rather
   than those already studied, where forest plantation is a common land
   use, should be considered.},

Abstract = {During forest succession, litterfall nutrient fluxes increase
   significantly. The higher inputs of organic matter and nutrients through
   litterfall affects positively soil fertility and the species
   composition, which are essential components in forest restoration and
   management programs. In the present study, the input of nutrients to the
   forest soil via litterfall components was estimated for two sites of
   different development stages, in an early successional alluvial rain
   forest in Brazil. Litterfall returned to the soil, in kg/ha, ca. 93 N.
   79 Ca, 24 K. 15 Mg, 6 P, 1.7 Mn, 0.94 Fe, 0.18 Zn, 0.09 Cu and 11.2 Al.
   in the site where trees were more abundant and had higher values of
   basal area. In the other area, where trees where less abundant and
   values of basal area were comparatively low, litterfall returned <50\%
   of those amounts to the forest soil, except for Al. The amount of Al
   that returned to the soil was similar in both areas due to the high
   contribution of Tibouchina pukhra (82\% of Al returned). Comparatively,
   high proportion of three dominant native tree species (Myrsine coriacea,
   T. pulchra and Cecropia pachystachya) explained better litter nutrient
   use efficiency (mainly N and P) in the site with the least advanced
   successional stage. Although litterfall of these species show lower
   nutrient concentrations than the other tree species, their nutrient
   fluxes were high in both sites, indicating a certain independence from
   soil essential nutrients. Such feature of the native species is very
   advantageous and should be considered in forest restoration programs.

Title = {Intra- and interspecific variations on plant functional traits along a
   successional gradient in a Brazilian tropical dry forest},
Journal = {FLORA},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {279},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The present study aimed to determine how plant functional traits change
   both at the intra- and interspecific levels along three successional
   stages (early, intermediate and late) in a Brazilian tropical dry forest
   (TDF). Plants in early-successional plots are expected to exhibit
   conservative traits to increase photoprotection and water conservation,
   whereas late successional plants would invest on acquisitive traits.
   Sampling was conducted in three plots of 50 x 20 m per successional
   stage, where plant species composition and structural parameters were
   previously determined for individuals with DBH >= 5 cm. From each of
   three plots, the five tree species with the highest importance values
   were selected. This resulted in a total of 13 species from seven
   families selected for this study. We quantified specific leaf area
   (SLA), leaf slenderness, polyphenols and chlorophyll contents, and leaf
   lifespan. Based on leaf traits, we detected two major tree functional
   species groups: the early-intermediate and the late successional groups.
   Confirming our expectations, the former was positively associated with
   drought tolerance traits (polyphenols and slenderness) related to
   conservative resource use; and the latter was positively associated with
   acquisitive traits (SLA). This pattern was partially corroborated at the
   intraspecific level for species that occurred in more than one
   successional stage. We found a weak phylogenetic signal for the
   functional grouping (only for polyphenols). The analysis of variance
   structure across scales indicated that a very small proportion (up to
   2.8\%) of the general variance in leaf traits occurred at intraspecific
   level suggesting that, compared to interspecific variations, trait
   differences among individuals due to phenotypic plasticity are low.
   Although further studies with a larger number of species are needed, our
   findings suggest a decoupling between functional and structural/species
   composition regeneration, contradicting several studies on secondary
   succession where species composition is regarded as the main indicator
   of the regeneration of ecological functions.},

Title = {Atlantic rain forest recovery: successional drivers of floristic and

Journal = {JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE},

Volume = {25},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Questions: The growing importance of secondary forests has stimulated
   research on the patterns of structure, biomass, species diversity and
   species composition of successional tropical forests. Despite current
   knowledge, the future of tropical forests and their ability to recover
   from human impacts are still a challenge for researchers. The Atlantic
   Forest is one of the most endangered ecosystems on Earth, yet has been
   reduced in size and distribution due to human disturbance such that most
   of the remaining fragments are secondary forest at different
   successional stages. How do these forests recover structure and species
   composition during succession? What are the main drivers of community
   assembly during succession?
   Location: Subtropical Atlantic rain forest, South Brazil (29 degrees
   42'S, 50 degrees 11' W).
   Method: Using four replicate chronosequences, we described floristic and
   structural successional patterns of subtropical Atlantic Forest in
   Brazil, and investigated causal relationships with environmental,
   spatial and temporal variables in structuring tree species composition.
   The chronosequences were described by four successional stages,
   according to floristic (species composition and richness) and structural
   (density, basal cover and height of trees) characteristics, tested using
   ANOVA with randomization tests. Time since abandonment and environmental
   conditions of topsoil, relief and spatial components were considered as
   possible successional drivers. Hypotheses about causal relationships in
   the successional process were tested using path analysis, considering
   the influence of those variables on the successional forest communities.
   Results: We found that forest stands of 26-45 yr old displayed
   structural characteristics similar to those of old-growth stands, but
   that species composition of successional forest was somewhat different
   from reference areas (old-growth forests). In our study, time since
   abandonment overcame the influence of environmental and spatial
   variables on forest assembly patterns in the chronosequences.
   Conclusions: Our study is the first one describing floristic and
   structural successional patterns of the Atlantic rain forest in a
   subtropical context and proposing causal relationships between recovery
   age, environment and community composition of secondary successional
   forests. We conclude that the dynamic of forest succession is autogenic
   and not entirely predictable from local environmental conditions of
   soil, space and relief.},

Title = {Natural regeneration as an indicator of ecological restoration by
   applied nucleation and passive restoration},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {157},
Month = {OCT 1},
Abstract = {Passive restoration and applied nucleation are important strategies for
   large-scale gains and cost reduction in ecological restoration projects.
   Passive restoration uses the natural regeneration potential while
   applied nucleation recreates microhabitats, which facilitates ecological
   succession. In this study, we assessed floristic composition, structure
   and functional groups as ecological indicators to compare passive
   restoration (fenced site 12 year ago), applied nucleation (7 years of
   dense seedling planting) and riparian forest. The study was carried out
   in a Seasonal Semi-deciduous Forest region in the Pampa biome, in the
   South of Brazil. We measured and identified all shrub and tree
   individuals greater than 30 cm in height. Analysis of variance (ANOVA)
   followed by the Tukey test (p < .05) was performed to compare
   composition (richness, abundance, diversity and evenness), structure
   (average height, maximum height, canopy cover, soil cover, leaf litter
   depth) and functional group variables (dispersion syndrome and shade
   tolerance). Riparian forest showed greater richness and diversity.
   Passive restoration and applied nucleation did not differ statistically
   in richness, abundance, maximum or average height, or for zoochoric
   species and zoochoric individual indicators. The leaf litter depth was
   statistically higher in the riparian forest. The applied nucleation
   presented a canopy cover similar to riparian forest, demonstrating
   ability to form habitats which are favorable to ecological succession.
   We can conclude that passive and applied nucleation restorations have
   been occurring in a slow process. This is the natural condition of the
   ecological succession in the Pampa biome, which is probably due to the
   subtropical climate. Although we could not verify the facilitation
   effect by functional groups in applied nucleation and expansion of the
   nuclei size, the floristic composition, diversity, canopy cover and leaf
   litter depth indicators suggest an acceleration in the ecological
   succession process. Long-term monitoring should be considered to assess
   the dynamics of ecological restoration in the subtropical region of
   Brazil.},

Abstract = {Tropical dry forests (TDFs) usually occur as mosaics at different stages
   of natural regeneration, along which variations in soil attributes
   (fertility and texture) can affect plant growth and leaf traits and,
   consequently, leaf herbivory. In the present study, we used a
   chronosequence approach to determine the variations in plant growth,
   leaf defense, and insect herbivory in different successional species
   groups, following the predictions of the resource availability
   hypothesis: plants at early successional stages would grow faster, have
   lower specific leaf mass (SLM), and suffer higher herbivore damage than
   late successional plants. For this purpose, we measured plant diameter
   and collected leaves at the end of the rainy season (April) during three
   consecutive years in three different successional stages (early,
   intermediate, and late). In total, we sampled 38 plant species, from
   which 31 species were exclusive to a single successional stage (10
   early, 13 intermediate, and eight late species). Our results did not
   conform to the resource availability hypothesis, as plants growing in
   early successional stages had higher growth rates and SLM, and lower
   leaf damage by herbivores. Soil fertility and texture did not affect
   plant growth or SLM, but leaf damage was negatively affected by SLM.
   Apart from being a defensive trait, SLM is also involved in the
   conservation of water and nutrients and photoprotection, and its
   variation along successional gradients in TDFs conforms to a continuum
   from conservative traits in hot and dry, early successional stages, to
   acquisitive traits in more humid late stages. Although other plant
   defenses must be considered, our three-year study indicates that the
   resource availability hypothesis, which was formulated for wet forests,
   should be adapted to deciduous TDFs where water availability is the main
   environmental filter along succession.},

Journal = {REVISTA ARVORE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {47},
Abstract = {Understanding the dynamics of endemic tree component species based on
   natural regeneration (NR) and adult trees (AT) is essential for
   formulating conservation strategies for protecting these species. The
   objective of the present study was to identify endemic species in a
   preserved area of secondary forest in the Atlantic Forest domain in
   Brazil and to evaluate their dynamics over 24 years. Based on
   inventories carried out from 1992 to 2016 of the NR (diameter at breast
   height -dbh <= 5 cm) and of the AT (dbh >= 5 cm) in ten sites with
   different characteristics (physiographic, edaphic, and successional), it
   was possible to, initially, identify 58 species classified as endemic to
   Brazil (EBR) and/or those exclusive to the Brazilian Atlantic Forest
   (EAF), among the 226 species in the entire survey. Subsequently, this
   classification was reassessed based on updated information on its
   occurrence, and only 38 of these species were maintained as endemic to
   Brazil and/or to the Atlantic Forest. Some species were recorded in the
   AT and NR strata, in different sites, throughout the study period, while
   others occurred in only one level (AT or NR), some with low abundance.
   Among these endemic species, eight are included in the endangered
   species lists, and 15 can be classified as rare, as there was only one
   individual in the survey. Considering the two arboreal strata it was
   observed that some species were abundant in the forest in all
   inventories and several sites, while others went throughout the study
   period with few individuals and, in some cases, disappeared due to
   mortality. These results contribute to understanding the factors that
   can affect the local abundance of endemic species over time, allowing
   the definition of conservation actions for protecting these vulnerable
   species, thus avoiding their extinction.},

Abstract = {Natural regeneration takes place through young trees and small plants
   that inhabit the interior of forests and are essential for the
   ecological succession of native forests. In forestry, conducting natural
   regeneration is a low-cost traditional forest management technique that
   is very suitable for native forests. The hypothesis raised is that the
   floristic and the structure of the vegetation are affected in the
   phytosociological parameters with the presence of cattle. For this
   article, 180 plots (2 x 2 m) distributed in six sample blocks were
   evaluated. Regardless of the topographic portion in toposequence, forest
   fragments isolated with wire fences presented better phytosociological
   parameters. In forest areas with access to grazing, species tolerant to
   grazing and trampling by animals were common. These were thorny, with
   flexible branches and/or toxic and caustic substances for cattle. Thus,
   according to the data collected from the structure of natural
   regeneration, currently there are two lines of forest succession in the
   forest fragments. These floristic and structural differences between
   forests with and without cattle ranching are recommended in the
   sustainable planning of rural ranching properties.},

Abstract = {The nuclei of vegetation are structures spontaneously formed by small
   clusters of individual shrubs and trees that, upon evolving in disturbed
   pastures can contribute to the ecological succession. In order to
   understand the evolution of passive restoration processes in tropical
   ecosystems, after extensive cattle ranching was stopped, environments
   with low environmental attributes were studied, located in the northern
   slope of the isolated mounds between floodplain. After 40 years of
   abandonment, the nuclei of vegetation colonized 20\% of the graminoid
   ecosystems sampled, presenting at a moderate stage of disturbance. The
   floristic composition of the upper strata and regenerating showed that
   nuclei with two or more pioneer forest species and anemocoric dispersion
   syndrome, such as Moquiniastrum polymorphum, present a high probability
   of having their restoration processes catalyzed in time. Developed
   nuclei present higher richness and abundance in their regenerating
   stratum, besides zoological and nonpioneering species, suggesting
   positive interactions between the ecological processes, a condition that
   gives sustainability to the advances of the passive forest restoration.
   The improvement of this information can contribute to the development of
   models of induced restoration based on the effects of nucleation.},

Abstract = {This study documents the proportion of woody plant species having
   different modes of seed dispersal, and classes of seed and fruit size at
   16 Atlantic montane forest plots of southeastern Brazil (23-24degrees
   S). These plots represent six chronosequences (from 5-year-old to
   old-growth forest) of forest regeneration following small-scale shifting
   agriculture. Our results indicate that there is a gradual but
   predictable increase in the number of woody plant species relying on
   vertebrate-mediated seed dispersal in increasingly older plots.
   Moreover, the percentage of plant species bearing small seeds and fruits
   (<0.6 cm in length) was more than halved from earlier to older forest
   plots, while the percentage of plant species producing middle-sized
   seeds and fruits at least doubled. Plant species belonging to the
   Melastomataceae, Myrsinaceae, Rubiaceae and Flacourtiaceae comprised a
   large proportion of the small-seeded and fruit species (33-53\%), and
   largely occurred in early Successional forest plots (5-30 years old). In
   contrast, species belonging to the Myrtaceae and Lauraceae represented
   most of the species (51-72\%) bearing medium-sized seeds and fruits
   (0.6-1.5 cm, in length), and occurred primarily in the old-growth
   forests. Shifts in the relative importance of dispersal strategies
   during the regeneration process of Atlantic montane forest, as well as
   in diaspore size appear to be related to the balance between early
   successional and shade-tolerant species associated with particular life
   forms and plant families. Finally, we discuss the relationships between
   the species richness of Myrtaceac and Lauraceae trees, seed dispersal by
   medium to large vertebrates, and possible regeneration scenarios for the
   Atlantic forest. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Riparian forests are key to protect water resources and biodiversity, so
   that efforts and funds have been directed towards its restoration. Nine
   areas, reforested on the basis of secondary succession with different
   ages (one to 13 years), as well as a naturally regenerated forest 23
   years old, are compared in this study, in terms of stand structure. The
   parameters adopted in this analysis were related to arboreal layer
   (bio-mass and fitossociology) and understory layer (density and
   richness). Planted forests presented a recovery process faster than the
   naturally regenerated stand, in terms of biomass. In this case, the
   values observed in the naturally regenerated forest (basal area = 15,05
   m(2) ha(-1); crown cover = 184,3\%) were not different from that
   observed in the reforested area aged three yeas old (basal area ranging
   from 15,1 to 16,2 m(2).ha(-1) and crown cover from 159,2 to 291,2). The
   eldest planted forest (13 years old) is structurally similar to mature
   riparian forests in the same environmental condition, but its species
   richness (26 tree species) is lower than the value of mature forest (68
   species). On the basis of these results, natural regeneration can be
   considered as a good technical solution to recover riparian forests only
   when costs are very limitative. Natural regeneration of arboreal species
   in the understory starts about seven years after planting and
   regenerating species are predominantly animal dispersed (46,6 to 95,6\%
   of the plants), other than those which were planted.},

Abstract = {With the high rates of deforestation in tropical regions, the
   restoration of degraded lands has become an important way for
   maintaining the diversity of plant communities and for creating wildlife
   habitats. Evaluating the success of restored areas is essential for
   improving restoration designs and for successfully restoring such
   complex ecosystems. In this study, the development of restoration
   forests with respect to age (5, 9 and 10 years old) and the restoration
   models used (proportion of pioneer trees) was assessed along the margins
   of Companhia Energetica do Estado de Sao Paulo (CESP) reservoirs,
   located in the region of Pontal do Pananapanema, in Sao Paulo state,
   southeastern Brazil. The overstory (trees greater than or equal to4.8 cm
   in DBH) was assessed in nine 900 m(2) permanent plots, and all woody
   understory regenerating plants (>50 cm in height and <4.8 cm in DBH)
   were counted and identified in 54 1 m radius subplots. Canopy and grass
   cover were assessed in the wet and dry seasons. All of the parameters
   were recorded again I year later to evaluate the development of the
   forests. In general, neither the restoration design nor age appeared to
   influence forest structure and dynamics, at least at the developmental
   stage studied here. The floristic complexity and density of regenerating
   individuals were still fairly low compared to natural forests. The
   arrival of propagules from other forest remnants was insignificant,
   suggesting that inadequate seed dispersal and faunal colonization
   limited species enrichment within the restoration sites. Although the
   overall results suggested that these restoration forests had reached a
   structural complexity sufficient to give a start to secondary
   succession, some factors such as the dominance of pioneer trees in the
   overstory, the small number of colonizing individuals arriving from
   external seed sources, the persistence of weedy grasses in the
   understory and the degree of isolation of the restoration sites may
   endanger the sustainability of these forests in the long term. Although
   neither the age nor restoration model produced differences in the forest
   structure and dynamics, it is possible that such differences may require
   a longer time to develop. Monitoring restoration sites is essential for
   understanding a forest's trajectory and for guiding management and
   intervention practices. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Ecological succession depends on the seed rain. While the simple arrival
   of seeds is not assurance of establishment, knowing the seed rain is the
   first approach to assessing the succession process in sites undergoing
   forest restoration. For this reason, we sampled the seed rain in a
   restoration site and in an adjacent seasonal semi-deciduous forest
   remnant in southern Brazil, in order to describe the process. In each
   area, 18 seed traps (1 m(2)) were allocated and visited monthly for two
   years. All seeds trapped were identified, counted and classified by life
   form, ecological group and dispersal syndrome. The forest remnant
   presented higher species richness and abundance of propagules than the
   restoration site. The composition of species also differed between
   areas. The seed rain of both areas presented a higher proportion of tree
   and shade-intolerant species. Several non-planted species, possibly
   dispersed from forest remnant, were recorded in the restoration site.
   Analysis of the results suggests that the seed rain is not a constraint
   to succession in the restoration site. However, the site should be
   monitored in the long term to assess the establishment, and not only the
   arrival of seeds of late successional species.},

Abstract = {One-third of all Neotropical forests are secondary forests that regrow
   naturally after agricultural use through secondary succession. We need
   to understand better how and why succession varies across environmental
   gradients and broad geographic scales. Here, we analyze functional
   recovery using community data on seven plant characteristics (traits) of
   1,016 forest plots from 30 chronosequence sites across the Neotropics.
   By analyzing communities in terms of their traits, we enhance
   understanding of the mechanisms of succession, assess ecosystem
   recovery, and use these insights to propose successful forest
   restoration strategies. Wet and dry forests diverged markedly for
   several traits that increase growth rate in wet forests but come at the
   expense of reduced drought tolerance, delay, or avoidance, which is
   important in seasonally dry forests. Dry and wet forests showed
   different successional pathways for several traits. In dry forests,
   species turnover is driven by drought tolerance traits that are
   important early in succession and in wet forests by shade tolerance
   traits that are important later in succession. In both forests,
   deciduous and compound-leaved trees decreased with forest age, probably
   because microclimatic conditions became less hot and dry. Our results
   suggest that climatic water availability drives functional recovery by
   influencing the start and trajectory of succession, resulting in a
   convergence of community trait values with forest age when vegetation
   cover builds up. Within plots, the range in functional trait values
   increased with age. Based on the observed successional trait changes, we
   indicate the consequences for carbon and nutrient cycling and propose an
   ecologically sound strategy to improve forest restoration success.},

Abstract = {The knowledge of structure and composition of forest strata contributes
   to understanding the conservation status and dynamics of plant
   communities. The study of forest understory is important to the
   knowledge of the succession process. The Seasonal Subtropical Forest
   remnant named Mato do Silva (27 degrees 55'26 `' S and 53 degrees 53'15
   `' W) was studied aiming to describe the structure of understory in the
   late successional forest (LF) and in the young secondary forest (SF), an
   11 years old post-agricultural site with canopy dominance of Ateleia
   glazioveana Baill. The phytosociological survey was carried out through
   the point quarter method and included individuals of tree and shrub
   species from 0.5 to 3.0 m of height. The sampling consisted of 384
   individuals in LF (67 species) and 284 individuals in SF (20 species). A
   total of 79 species were observed, and only eight species occurred in
   both areas. The specific diversity (H') was 3.45 and 2.42 nats in the
   understory of LF and SF, respectively. The Pielou's evenness index (J)
   was 0.85 to LF and 0.80 to SF, respectively. Cupania vernalis Camb. and
   Psychotria leiocarpa Mull. A rg. were the prominent species in the LF
   while A. glazioveana and Solanum mauritianum Scop. were outstanding in
   the SF understory. Shade-tolerant and late secondary tree species
   occurred in large proportion in the LF forest, while pioneers and early
   secondary tree species predominated in the SF. In addition, certain
   dominant species in the understory of the SF were absent in the LF
   understory, such as A. glazioveana, Solanum compressum L. B. Sm. \&
   Downs, Helietta apiculata Bentham and Gledtisia amorphoides (Griseb.)
   Taubert, which indicates that such species are associated to early
   stages of forest succession. G. amorphoides is considered an endangered
   species, and the early successional stages could be necessary for
   conservation of this species. A decrease in the pH and mineral nutrient
   levels in the soil was linked to the successional process, indicating
   the transference of nutrients to the aboveground biomass.},

Abstract = {The restoration of anthropogenically disturbed sites contributes to
   biodiversity conservation, but pre-recovery land-use history affects the
   restoration and recovery time of impacted forest sites. The objective of
   the present study was to assess the effects of different land-use
   histories (low-impact logging - LL, high-impact logging - HL, and
   slash-and-burn - SB) on quantitative (diversity values) and qualitative
   (floristic composition) measures of forest recovery. This research was
   conducted in Atlantic rainforest areas of Bahia State, Brazil, which had
   remained undisturbed for 50 to 60 years after human disturbance.
   Surprisingly, the area subjected to the most aggressive usage (SB)
   showed intermediate richness and diversity values, but had a floristic
   composition dominated by pioneer species similar to early-successional
   forests. Families typical of preserved areas (Sapotaceae and Myrtaceae)
   were more diverse in LL and HL areas. Our results indicate both
   quantitative and qualitative recovery in areas subjected to LL, which
   tended to recover without intervention. Areas subjected to HL showed
   intermediate qualitative recovery and the lowest quantitative recovery,
   and may therefore require enrichment to accelerate recovery. Despite
   good quantitative (species richness and diversity) recovery, the
   slash-and-burn areas had a predominance of early successional species,
   which indicates that enrichment actions are essential for the recovery
   of these forest areas. Knowledge of how land-use history influences
   forest restoration processes can guide management actions and thereby

Abstract = {Natural regeneration of forests has significantly led to increased
   native forest cover in some regions. Several studies have explored the
   spatial drivers of forest cover increase, yet little is known about
   their effects on forest structure and species richness and diversity. We
   quantified the effects of local (forest age, remnant Eucalyptus basal
   area, slope, soil fertility, and clay content) and landscape drivers
   (surrounding land use, distance from streams, and surrounding forest
   cover and its change over time) on the aboveground biomass, species
   density, and phylogenetic diversity of native trees in second-growth
   forests. We sampled 44 naturally regenerating forests established on
   former pastures and abandoned Eucalyptus plantations for 11-46 years in
   agricultural landscapes of the southeastern Atlantic Forest, Brazil. We
   used generalized linear mixed effect models to quantify the effect
   drivers on forest attributes. While only Eucalyptus basal area and
   proximity to sugarcane plantations had a consistent negative effect on
   forest biomass, other drivers were among the best models to explain
   forest attributes, but their effect was variable. Age increased tree
   biomass but the effect was not consistent. Similarly, species richness
   and phylogenetic diversity were mainly affected by landscape drivers
   such as surrounding forest cover. In tropical agricultural landscapes,
   effective forest recovery requires more than just time, as forest age
   can be less important in determining forest attributes than human land
   uses and surrounding native forest cover. Crucially, forest recovery can
   be improved through interventions and policies that promote less
   impactful human activities and enhance existing forest cover.

   were allocated, all individuals with height = 1.0 m and DBH < 5 cm were
   sampled. Shannon's diversity index (H'), Pielou's equability index (J)
   and total natural regeneration rate (TNR) were estimated. We sampled
   1,425 individuals from 99 species and 39 families, with an estimated
   total density of 5,700 individuals by hectare. The richest families were
   Fabaceae (13), Myrtaceae (10) and Lauraceae (7). The H' was 3.76 and the
   J was 0.80. The TNR rate ranged from 0.05 to 8.12\%, highlighting
   Trichilia elegans, with the highest rate and Araucaria angustifolia with
   low potential for natural regeneration. The analysis of the results
   indicated a high diversity in the regenerating component of the PEAR
   compared to other studies, probably because the area presents itself as
   a successional mosaic due to past disturbances.},

Abstract = {Litterfall and litter decomposition are vital processes in tropical
   forests because they regulate nutrient cycling. Nutrient cycling can be
   altered by forest fragmentation. The Atlantic Forest is one of the most
   threatened biomes in the world due to human occupation over the last 500
   years. This scenario has resulted in fragments of different size, age
   and regeneration phase. To investigate differences in litterfall and
   leaf decomposition between forest successional phases, we compared six
   forest fragments at three different successional phases and an area of
   mature forest on the Atlantic Plateau of Sao Paulo, Brazil. We sampled
   litter monthly from November 2008 to October 2009. We used litterbags to
   calculate leaf decomposition rate of an exotic species, Tipuana tipu
   (Fabaceae), over the same period litter sampling was performed.
   Litterfall was higher in the earliest successional area. This pattern
   may be related to the structural properties of the forest fragments,
   especially the higher abundance of pioneer species, which have higher
   productivity and are typical of early successional areas. However, we
   have not found significant differences in the decomposition rates
   between the studied areas, which may be caused by rapid stabilization of
   the decomposition environment (combined effect of microclimatic
   conditions and the decomposers activities). This result indicates that
   the leaf decomposition process have already been restored to levels
   observed in mature forests after a few decades of regeneration, although
   litterfall has not been entirely restored. This study emphasizes the
   importance of secondary forests for restoration of ecosystem processes
   on a regional scale.},

Title = {NATURAL REGENERATION IN ABANDONED FIELDS FOLLOWING INTENSIVE
   AGRICULTURAL LAND USE IN AN ATLANTIC FOREST ISLAND, BRAZIL},
Journal = {REVISTA ARVORE},

Volume = {36},
Number = {4},

Month = {JUL-AUG},
Abstract = {The time required to regrowth a forest in degraded areas depends on how
   the forest is removed and on the type of land use following removal.
   Natural regeneration was studied in abandoned old fields after intensive
   agricultural land use in areas originally covered by Brazilian Atlantic
   Forests of the Anchieta Island, Brazil in order to understand how plant
   communities reassemble following human disturbances as well as to
   determine suitable strategies of forest restoration. The fields were
   classified into three vegetation types according to the dominant plant
   species in: 1) Miconia albicans (Sw.) Triana (Melastomataceae) fields,
   2) Dicranopteris flexuosa (Schrader) Underw. (Gleicheniaceae) thickets,
   and 3) Gleichenella pectinata (Willd.) Ching. (Gleicheniaceae) thickets.
   Both composition and structure of natural regeneration were compared
   among the three dominant vegetation types by establishing randomly three
   plots of 1 x 3 m in five sites of the island. A gradient in composition
   and abundance of species in natural regeneration could be observed along
   vegetation types from Dicranopteris fern thickets to Miconia fields. The
   gradient did not accurately follow the pattern of spatial distribution
   of the three dominant vegetation types in the island regarding their
   proximity of the remnant forests. A complex association of biotic and
   abiotic factors seems to be affecting the seedling recruitment and
   establishment in the study plots. The lowest plant regeneration found in
   Dicranopteris and Gleichenella thickets suggests that the ferns inhibit
   the recruitment of woody and herbaceous species. Otherwise, we could not
   distinguish different patterns of tree regeneration among the three
   vegetation types. Our results showed that forest recovery following
   severe anthropogenic disturbances is not direct, predictable or even
   achievable on its own. Appropriated actions and methods such as fern
   removal, planting ground covers, and enrichment planting with tree
   species were suggested in order to restore the natural forest
   regeneration process in the abandoned old fields.},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Aim The primary objectives of this study were (1) to assess, in the
   light of palaeoecological reconstruction, the climate stability
   hypothesis used by evolutionary biologists to explain high diversity in
   historically stable areas, and (2) to identify the response mechanisms
   of a tropical rain forest microrefugium to climatic variability.
   Location North-eastern Brazil, Serra de Maranguape. Methods Vegetation
   and climatic changes were reconstructed using a pollen record in a
   sediment core from a forest hollow, and the chronology was based on
   accelerator mass spectrometry radiocarbon analyses. Results Past
   vegetation dynamics consisted of three main forest types, shown by major
   compositional changes in rain forest assemblages between 5000 and
   1000cal. yr bp. Dense ombrophilous forest was abruptly replaced by
   heliophilous early successional tree taxa at 4275cal. yr bp. These early
   successional tree taxa were established over a period of c.100years, and
   their dominance lasted for c.750years and was associated with dry
   conditions until 3525cal. yr bp. Subsequently, the expansion of
   secondary successional tree taxa over a period of c.550years enabled the
   recovery of ombrophilous forest. Main conclusions The vegetation changes
   in the Serra de Maranguape provide evidence for the high sensitivity of
   this rain forest microrefugium to climatic variability on a multidecadal
   to millennial time-scale during the mid- to late Holocene. Despite the
   substantial compositional and climatic changes, this microrefugium
   apparently was continuously forested and responded to climatic
   instability by recruiting key species to its highly diverse stock. This
   evidence helps to address the joint concerns of evolutionary biologists
   and palaeoecologists regarding how forests can persist during periods of
   climatic variability by showing that some tropical regions can remain
   continuously forested despite reorganization during abrupt and
   short-term climatic changes.},

Title = {Linking vegetation and soil functions during secondary forest succession
   in the Atlantic forest},
Journal = {FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {457},
Month = {FEB 1},
Abstract = {Secondary forest succession can be an effective and low-cost strategy to
   increase forest cover and the associated biodiversity and soil
   functions. However, little is known about how soil functions develop
   during succession, and how vegetation attributes influence soil
   functions, especially in highly biodiverse and fragmented landscapes in
   the tropics. Here we assessed a wide range of indicators of taxonomic
   (e.g. number of tree species), structural (e.g. basal area, canopy
   openness) and functional diversity (e.g. community weighted means of
   functional traits) of tree species, as well as indicators for soil
   functions related to soil organic matter accumulation, nutrient cycling
   and soil cover in secondary forest patches ranging from 5 to 80 years.
   Two recently abandoned agricultural fields were included as the starting
   point of forest succession and two primary forest patches served as
   references for the end point of forest succession. Four ecological
   hypotheses, centred around the role of functional diversity, structural
   diversity and biomass, were tested to explore mechanisms in which forest
   vegetation may influence soil functions. Most measures of structural,
   taxonomic and functional diversity converged to values found in primary
   forests after 25-50 years of succession, whereas functional composition
   changed from acquisitive to conservative species. Soil carbon and
   nutrient cycling showed a quick recovery to the levels of primary
   forests after 15 years of succession. Although soil cover also increased
   during succession, levels of primary forests were not reached within 80
   years. Variation in tree height and trait dominance were identified as
   aboveground drivers of carbon and nutrient cycling, while aboveground
   biomass was the main driver of litter accumulation, and the associated
   soil cover and water retention. Our results indicate that secondary
   forest succession can lead to a relative fast recovery of nutrient and
   carbon cycling functions, but not of soil cover. Our findings highlight
   the essential role of secondary forests in providing multiple ecosystem
   services. These results can be used to inform management and
   reforestation programmes targeted at strengthening soil functions, such
   as soil cover, nutrient and carbon cycling.},

Abstract = {In highly degraded areas such as degraded land, human intervention is
   critical so that the environment can recover its ecological functions.
   One of the techniques used for this process is the use of leguminous
   trees associated with microorganisms. Ecologically, these species are
   distinguished by associating symbiotically with nitrogen-fixing bacteria
   and mycorrhizal fungi. This alliance enables a significant improvement
   of the plant???s nutritional status, accelerating the process of
   ecological succession and thus contributing to the area???s restoration.
   Given this knowledge, in 1989, began the revegetation of a clay loan
   area with seedlings nodulated and mycorrhizal legume trees. As such,
   this study aims to assess the ecological succession of a degraded land
   located in the experimental field of Embrapa Agrobiologia, Serop??dica
   -RJ. Therefore, we evaluated the seed bank and the stock of litter. The
   use of leguminous trees has proved its effectiveness in activating the
   mechanisms of natural succession. Twenty-five years after planting
   legumes, 37 species of 16 botanical families emerged, besides the
   improvement of soil fertility and supply of litter. The study reflects
   the need to give more importance to other forest guilds in restoration
   projects, even considering the success of tree legumes in the catalysis
   of the ecological succession process.},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {QuestionsOur study aims to understand whether priority effects or
   environmental filters drive community assembly in 20-year-old
   restoration areas in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. For this, we
   investigated the following questions: (i) does the initial composition
   of planted communities (distinct combination of ecological groups)
   affect the natural regeneration regarding functional composition (mean
   trait values), diversity (functional and taxonomic), and vegetation
   structure? (ii) Which functional traits of the planted community have
   the potential to promote or constrain natural regeneration?LocationThe
   study was carried out in the Poco das Antas Biological Reserve, located
   in Rio de Janeiro state, Brazil, in a stand of 2.16 hectares with an
   experimental restoration design established in the year 2000 to test
   tree species performance of different ecological groups.MethodsIn 2020,
   we sampled trees with a diameter at breast height greater than 2.5 cm in
   20 m x 20 m plots with four replicates per treatment and measured leaf,
   wood, and seed functional traits. Then, we estimated the diversity
   (functional and taxonomic richness), functional composition, and
   vegetation structure of natural regeneration, compared them between
   treatments, and tested which traits of the planted community influenced
   them.ResultsNatural regeneration exhibited significant differences
   between treatments, particularly regarding the diversity dimension
   (functional and taxonomic) and vegetation structure (basal area and
   abundance). Wood density, leaf phosphorus content, and leaf C:N ratio of
   the planted species were associated with natural regeneration
   (functional composition, diversity, and vegetation
   structure).ConclusionsPriority effects in conservative tree planting
   communities affect natural regeneration, while functional convergence
   observed in acquisitive planting communities suggests the role of
   environmental filtering. Communities with low wood density, low C:N
   ratio, and high specific leaf area, which characterize an acquisitive
   resource-use strategy, exhibited higher functional and taxonomic
   diversity of natural regeneration, leading to the desired trajectory in
   ecological restoration.
   Our study investigated the community assembly in a 20-year-old Brazilian
   Atlantic Forest restoration area. Different tree planting arrangements
   affected natural regeneration in its diversity and structure. Wood
   density, leaf phosphorus content, and leaf C:N ratio of the planted
   species influenced natural regeneration, suggesting priority effects
   favoring certain resource-use strategies. Environmental filtering has a
   stronger effect on natural regeneration when the priority effect of
   competition is weak.image},

Abstract = {Pteridium aquilinum (Dennstaedtiaceae) colonization affects ecological
   and restoration processes. The knowledge of the impacts on the
   ecological succession by this species allows the use of restoration
   strategies in invaded environments. This work aimed to evaluate the
   floristic composition, diversity, structure, density, basal area,
   height, and diameter of natural regeneration in three areas of the
   Atlantic Forest in the Serra do Espinhaco Biosphere Reserve in an area
   invaded by P. aquilinum after a fire. Three environments with different
   coverage intensities by P. aquilinum were studied, and the plants over
   10 cm in height or 5 cm in canopy diameter were measured. The floristic
   composition and diversity were analyzed using indices presented by Chao,
   Fisher, Margalef, Pielou, Shannon-Weaver, and Simpson, and similarity
   was evaluated by the Jaccard index. Species density, basal area, height,
   and canopy diameter classes were also evaluated. The floristic
   composition, diversity, structure of natural regeneration, density, and
   basal area were higher in post-fire areas with a lower coverage by P.
   aquilinum. The topsoil coverage with plant litter and the possible
   effect of P. aquilinum allelopathy probably reduced the species richness
   and diversity. The proportion of plants from the lowest height and
   canopy diameter classes was higher center dot under moderate coverage by
   P. aquilinum. The reduction in the floristic composition, diversity,
   number of species, and basal area in post-fire areas colonized by P.
   aquilinum is probably due to this species aggressiveness. The population
   of this plant is high, accumulating large quantities of plant litter as
   a physical barrier preventing light and propagules from reaching the
   soil, reducing the germination of the seed bank and, consequently, the
   natural regeneration. The floristic composition, diversity, structure of
   natural regeneration, density, and basal area were lower in areas with
   higher coverage by P. aquilinum. The proportion of plants in the most
   significant height and canopy diameter classes was higher with reduced
   coverage by P. aquilinum. The P. aquilinum reduced forest succession in
   areas after a fire.},

Abstract = {The objective of this work was to select indigenous vegetal species for
   restoration programs aiming at the regeneration of ombrophilous dense
   forest. Thirty-five spoil piles located in the county of Sideropolis,
   Santa Catarina, that received overburden disposal for 39 years
   (1950-1989) were selected for study because they exhibited remarkable
   spontaneous regrowth of trees compared to surrounding spoil piles.
   Floristic inventory covered the whole area of the 35 piles, whereas
   survey on phytosociology and natural regeneration studies were conducted
   in 70 plots distributed along the 35 piles. Floristic inventory recorded
   83 species from 28 botanical families. Herbaceous terricolous plants
   constituted the predominant species (47.0\%), followed by shrubs
   (26.5\%), trees (19.3\%), and vines (7.2\%). Results from surveys on
   phytosociology and natural regeneration, focused on shrubs and trees,
   recorded incipient ecological succession. In addition, the most adapted
   species recorded on the overburden piles, as ranked by index of natural
   regeneration (RNT) plus importance value index (IVI), were as follows:
   Clethra scabra (RNT = 23.93\%; IVI = 17.28\%), Myrsine coriacea (RNT =
   20.93\%, IVI = 11.26\%), Eupatorium intermedium (RNT 7.56\%, IVI
   0.40\%), Miconia ligustroides (RNT 5.84\%, IVI 2.37\%), Ossaea
   amygdaloides (RNT 3.84\%, IVI 1.30\%), Tibouchina sellowiana (RNT
   3.29\%, M 1.94\%), Eup. inulaefolium (RNT = 2.65\%, IVI = 0.80\%), and
   Baccharis dracunculifolia (RNT = 2.28\%; IVI = 0.56\%). High values of
   IVI and RNT exhibited by the exotic species Eucalyptus saligna (IVI =
   21.73\%, RNT = 51.41\%) indicated strong competition between exotic and
   indigenous species. Severe chemical (acidic pH and lack of nutrients)
   and physical (coarse substrate and slope angle of 40-50 degrees)
   characteristics displayed by the overburden piles constituted
   limitations to floristic diversity and size of indigenous trees,
   indicating the need for substrate reclamation prior to forest
   restoration.},

Title = {Biological Properties and Organic Matter Dynamics of Soil in Pasture and
   Natural Regeneration Areas in the Atlantic Forest Biome},
Journal = {REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIA DO SOLO},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {40},
Abstract = {The removal of original vegetation for crops and pasture production and
   then followed by natural regeneration is a standard practice in the
   Atlantic Forest, which has produced patches with different degrees of
   degradation and regeneration across the landscape. The aim of this study
   was to evaluate the effects of replacement of native forest by pasture
   and natural regeneration of vegetation on soil and on soil organic
   matter (SOM) dynamics in the dry and rainy season in an Atlantic Forest
   fragment in Passa Vinte, Minas Gerais (MG), Brazil. Soil samples were
   collected in the rainy and dry season, at a depth of 0.00-0.05 m. The
   variables determined were total organic carbon (TOC) and particle-size
   fractions of SOM {[}particulate organic carbon (POC) and
   mineral-associated organic carbon (MOC)]; microbial activity by basal
   respiration (BR) and microbial biomass carbon (MBC); species richness
   (SR) and spore abundance (SA) of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF); and
   total and easily extractable glomalin-related soil protein (T-GRSP and
   EE-GRSP, respectively). The conversion of native forest into pasture
   reduced TOC, POC, MOC, AMF-SA, T-GRSP, and EE-GRSP. However, it did not
   reduce MBC and BR. The fallow period in the area under natural
   regeneration was not long enough to restore soil TOC, POC, MOC, BR, MBC,
   T-GRSP, and EE-GRSP to levels approaching those observed in the forest
   area. Nevertheless, natural regeneration of vegetation stimulated the
   production of seedlings (spores) of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, which
   are important for the establishment of plant species and advance of
   ecological succession. Seasonality affected some of the biological soil
   properties and SOM dynamics.},

Abstract = {This study determined the temporal patterns of herbivory on Handroanthus
   ochraceus (Cham.) Mattos (Bignoniaceae) along a successional gradient in
   a seasonally dry tropical forest (SDTF) in southeastern Brazil. We
   assessed the diversity of free-feeding herbivore insects (sap-suckers
   and leaf-chewers), leaf herbivory rates, leaf nitrogen content, phenolic
   compounds, and spider abundance through the rainy season in three
   different successional stages (early, intermediate, and late). Sampling
   was conducted in December, at the beginning of the rainy season (with
   fully expanded young leaves), February (mid-aged leaves), and April, at
   the end of rainy season (old leaves). Fifteen reproductive trees of H.
   ochraceus were sampled per successional stage in each month of sampling.
   Herbivore diversity was highest in the early stage of succession, but
   herbivory rates were highest in the intermediate and late stages. This
   result was probably related to differences in herbivore community
   composition and leaf quality across successional stages. The highest
   herbivore abundance was found in April in the early successional stage.
   In addition, we found low levels of herbivory in the intermediate and
   late successional stages in the second half of the rainy season. For
   each successional stage, leaf nitrogen content decreased through the
   rainy season, whereas the concentration of phenolic compounds increased.
   For the intermediate and late successional stages, the temporal changes
   that took place as the rainy season progressed corroborated the
   following hypotheses postulated for SDTFs: (1) both the abundance of
   chewing insects and herbivory rates decreased, (2) the abundance of
   natural enemies (i.e., spiders) increased, and (3) leaf quality
   decreased. These results suggest that the described herbivory patterns
   are robust for advanced successional stages (intermediate and late) of
   the SDTFs, but may not apply to early successional stages of these
   forests.},

Abstract = {The natural regeneration management is a good strategy of ecological
   restoration of the Atlantic Forest, one of the most devastated biomes on
   the planet. However, the frequent occurrence of wildfires is one of the
   challenges to the success of this method. The objective of this study
   was to evaluate the effects of wildfires on forest dynamics in Atlantic
   Forest. The studied area was explored during the coffee cycle when
   plantations replaced primary forests. We used remote sensing data to
   analyze the forest dynamics over a period of 50 years (1966-2016). We
   used the INPE burn database to find the occurrence of hot spots from
   1998 to 2016. During this period, we selected the years most affected by
   the fires for the identification of fire scars using the Normalized Burn
   Ratio spectral index. From this set of information, we used the
   methodology of weights of evidence to relate forest dynamics and
   wildfire events with biophysical and anthropic variables. The results
   showed that in 1966 the forest area accounted for 8.01\% of the land
   cover, and in 2016 this number rose to 18.55\% due to the spontaneous
   natural regeneration process. The regenerating areas were mainly related
   to the proximity of the remaining fragments and the portions of the
   landscape receiving the least amount of global solar radiation. The
   proximity to urban areas, roads and highways, damaged regeneration and
   favored both deforestation and wildfire events. Fire scars
   preferentially occur where there is greater sun exposure. It is possible
   to observe a negative correlation between the natural regeneration
   process and the fire scars. We concluded that fire severity is one of
   the factors that shape the landscape of the region while slowing the
   regeneration process in preferential areas. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {There is a great need of research to assess the behavior of

   the objective of this work was to study the levels and amounts of
   micronutrients in forest above ground biomass of the forest, in a
   comparative way, in two secondary succession stages (SSS) in a Seasonal
   Deciduous Forest in Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. The SSS had enjoyed 35
   and 55 years of regeneration since the end of agricultural use,
   respectively for initial secondary forest (ISF) and late secondary
   forest (LSF). The above-ground biomass was collected and separated into
   vegetative strata and these in fractions, thereafter chemically analyzed
   for the levels of B, Fe, Zn, Mn and Cu. Leaf fractions of arboreal,
   shrubs and herbaceous strata showed the highest levels for most
   nutrients. Only the levels of iron and manganese were higher in the bark
   fraction, for both sucession stages. In the LSF, the herbaceous stratum
   also showed high levels of Fe. The average levels of micronutrients
   showed differences between the two sucession stages only in relation to
   Fe and Mn, with higher levels in LSF biomass. The amount of nutrients
   stored was always higher in LSF, because of the largest biomass and the
   higher levels of Fe and Mn in the biomass of this SSS. The quantitative
   order of nutrient storage in biomass was Fe> Mn> Zn> B> Cu.},

Abstract = {The tropical dry forest (TDF) is one the most threatened ecosystems in
   South America, existing on a landscape with different levels of
   ecological succession. Among satellites dedicated to Earth observation
   and monitoring ecosystem succession, CHRIS/PROBA is the only satellite
   that presents quasi-simultaneous multi-angular pointing and
   hyperspectral imaging. These two characteristics permit the study of
   structural and compositional differences of TDFs with different levels
   of succession. In this paper, we use 2008 and 2014 CHRIS/PROBA images
   from a TDF in Minas Gerais, Brazil to study ecosystem succession after
   abandonment. Using a -55 degrees angle of observation; several
   classifiers including spectral angle mapper (SAM), support vector
   machine (SVM), and decision trees (DT) were used to test how well they
   discriminate between different successional stages. Our findings suggest
   that the SAM is the most appropriate method to classify TDFs as a
   function of succession (accuracies similar to 80 for \% for late stage,
   similar to 85\% for the intermediate stage, similar to 70\% for early
   stage, and similar to 50\% for other classes). Although CHRIS/PROBA
   cannot be used for large-scale/long-term monitoring of tropical forests
   because of its experimental nature; our results support the potential of
   using multi-angle hyperspectral data to characterize the structure and
   composition of TDFs in the near future.},

Abstract = {Permanent plots were studied over 6 years in approximately 64 ha of
   undisturbed gallery forest alongside the Gama stream in the Federal
   District, Brazil. Trees from 31 cm with at breast height (gbh) (ca. 10
   cm diameter at breast height (dbh)) were measured every 3 years from
   1985 in 151 (10 m X 20 m) permanent plots. Natural regeneration
   (individuals under 31 cm gbh) was measured in 1986, 1989 and 1991 in
   subplots within the 200 m(2) plots.
   The total tree flora (gbh greater than or equal to 31 cm) consisted of
   93 species, 81 genera and 44 families in 1985. Almost all species,
   present as trees, had seedlings and saplings at some time during the
   measurement period: but for most species one of these phases was missing
   on some occasions. Regeneration of about 80\% of the species occurred in
   the establishment phase (poles). The density structure of trees and
   natural regeneration was similar to each other with more than 80\% of
   the species occurring at low densities. The rate of decrease between
   successive height classes was around 50\%, indicating the typical low
   level of establishment for juveniles in tropical forests. The species
   most abundant as trees also had abundant regeneration, apart from few
   exceptions. Therefore, the Gama community seems to be robust enough to
   maintain a diversity of species and structure in undisturbed conditions.},

Abstract = {Natural regeneration of forests is one of the most important tools for
   inferring about the behavior of forest restoration processes. In this
   context, the objective of this study was to evaluate the natural
   regeneration in an area of Dense Rainforest of the Lowlands after 8
   years of implementation of the restoration project. The area consisted
   of six treatments (factorial 3 x 2), with three levels of species
   richness, two spacings and three repetitions, in randomized blocks. In
   each treatment and in the mature forest three plots of 5 x 10 m were
   demarcated, identifying all woody and herbaceous individuals. Floristic
   diversity (H') and equability (J') were calculated, in addition to the
   Distended Correspondence Analysis (DCA). The floristic diversity and
   equability were lower in areas undergoing restoration (H' = 1.82 nats
   indiv(-1) and J' = 0.51). The DCA resulted in the formation of distinct
   groups, which differ from the mature forest of the area under
   restoration. In all treatments, a large number of herbaceous individuals
   were registered (3,963), which may have negatively influenced the
   establishment of woody individuals (351). The statistics revealed that
   the shared treatments of many woody and herbaceous species, reinforcing
   that planting with greater richness of species is no guarantee of
   success in establishing natural regeneration with high diversity.},

Title = {The potential of the soil seed bank for the regeneration of a tropical

Abstract = {Isolated forest fragments are subject to natural and anthropogenic
   disturbances that can alter forest properties. Native bamboo species are
   favored by disturbances. Few studies have attempted to demonstrate the
   influence of bamboos regarding the availability of soil seed bank and
   their implications for management. The present study aims to evaluate
   whether the dominance and the maintenance of the forest in the early
   stages of succession has been facilitated by the structure of the local
   seed bank within an urban fragment of Atlantic forest in Brazil. We also
   evaluated the forest regeneration potential of the soil seed bank under
   a bamboo-dominated area and a control area. A total of 5181 (units)
   seeds were germinated, corresponding to 81 plant species in 31 families.
   Miconia cf cinnanomifolia was the most abundant species in the seed bank
   for both forests (72.6\% in control and 43.9\% in bamboo-dominant).
   Despite the low diversity and evenness found in both areas, the seed
   bank in the bamboo-dominated area had higher species richness and
   diversity, and a heterogeneous floristic composition of shrub and tree
   species when compared to the control area. In both areas
   early-successional species of trees and shrubs dominated the seed bank
   (>90\%). The results are discussed in terms of the regeneration ability,
   and it is suggested that in spite the area being a remnant with
   disturbed forest patches invaded by bamboos, the soil seed bank still
   represents an important seed source for forest regeneration. (C) 2010

Abstract = {Our aim was to analyze areas of Atlantic rainforest after clearcutting

   by abandonment and simple abandonment (NR)). We then compared
   composition parameters, structure and ecological processes with native

   municipality, Sao Paulo State, Brazil. Data collection was performed six
   years after clearcutting, including all woody plants found in two strata
   (DBH (diameter at 1.3 m soil) >= 5cm and DBH <5cm and height >= 1.5m,
   respectively). PA and RN showed lower values of richness, density, basal
   area, and diversity index (H') when compared with F for both strata.
   Thus, independently of management type, six years of abandonment were
   not enough to recover the parameters analyzed, compared to native
   forest. Type of management influences ecological succession and
   structural parameters considering the second strata only.},

Abstract = {Changes in physiognomy, species composition and structure, and dispersal
   mechanisms of canopy and subcanopy plant assemblages were investigated
   along a chronosequence of three ages: 12, 20, and 50+ years old
   (=old-growth), three replications in each, in an Atlantic Forest
   landscape in Northeastern Brazil. Our objective was to investigate
   whether there is floristic and structural convergence along secondary
   succession. There were significant differences between secondary and
   old-growth forests in density and basal area only for the subcanopy.
   Differences in density between forest ages were noted when the
   assemblage was analyzed per diameter and height classes. Richness of
   canopy species of both secondary ages differed from those of old-growth
   forests. Some dominant species in the canopy of secondary forests showed
   a significant decrease in density with increasing age, which indicates
   an ongoing process of floristic changes. The low level of shared species
   between secondary and old-growth forests supports the idea that species
   composition is one of the last components to recover during successional
   process. Zoochory was the most important dispersal guild in species
   percentage and number, irrespective of stand age. Although regenerating
   areas can take alternative pathways, our results indicate that secondary
   Atlantic Forest sites have a high potential for natural regeneration.
   This recovery is recorded as a physiognomic convergence of the canopy
   layer in as little as 12 years, and progressive introductions of later
   successional species into the plant assemblage that lead to convergence
   in terms of the diversity and richness of the subcanopy and of dispersal
   guilds just 20 years after abandonment.},

Abstract = {This study aimed to evaluate open source softwares in order to classify
   secondary successional forest stages in Shade Tolerant Mixed Forest
   (FOM) environments in Southern Brazil. Two test sites were selected in
   the mountainous region of Santa Catarina State. We used scenes from the
   airborne system for acquisition and post-processing of images (SAAPI)
   with a spatial resolution of 0.39m. The dataset consists of
   orthorectified images containing three spectral bands in the visible
   range (i.e. 0.38-0.70 mu m), three spectral bands in the near infrared
   (i.e. 0.76-0.78 mu m) and a digital surface model. The methodologies
   were developed using feature selection and decision tree algorithms in
   the following open source softwares: InterIMAGE, WEKA and QGIS. The
   results were satisfactory to classify successional stages of FOM as well
   as other classes of land use and land cover. The obtained Kappa indices
   ranged from 0.53 to 0.59 and the conditional Kappa varied from 0.29 to
   0.83 for the successional forest stages. These results demonstrate the
   potential of these approaches for the extraction of information in high
   spatial resolution imagery as well as the possibility of providing
   subsidies for the implementation of public policies and monitoring of
   forest resources.},

Abstract = {Animal-plant interactions are important for the recovery of diversity
   and processes in secondary forests, which increasingly dominate the
   tropical landscape. We used a combination of observational and
   experimental approaches to study the interactions of ants with diaspores
   across a successional gradient of forests in Southern Brazil, from
   August 2007 to April 2008. In addition to diaspore removal rates, we
   assessed the species richness, diversity and behaviour of ants
   interacting with diaspores, in three replicated sites of four
   successional stages of forests. We recorded 22 ant species interacting
   with diaspores (an estimated 15\% of the total species pool in the
   region). Species richness and diversity did not differ among
   successional stages but the behaviour of ants towards diaspores changed
   with the age of secondary forests. In old successional stages the
   removal of entire diaspores was more common than in young successional
   stages of forests. Concordantly, diaspore removal rates were lowest in
   the youngest successional stage of secondary forests and increased with
   the age of forests. These results indicate that ant-diaspore
   interactions in secondary forests are disturbed and lower removal rates
   in secondary forests are likely to constrain the recruitment of plant
   populations during secondary succession.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF TROPICAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 JUN 28},
Abstract = {Litter production plays an important role in the functioning of the
   ecosystem, providing several ecosystem services, such as nutrients
   cycling and carbon storage. We studied litter production patterns and
   its relationship with forest structure over a chronosequence of
   secondary forests in southern Bahia, Brazil. In the study area, 15 pairs
   of mature and secondary forest were used, in a chronological sequence,
   being 10, 25 and 40-year-old secondary forests and mature forests. Plots
   were created for the collection of aboveground biomass data, and within
   these plots, litter collectors were installed and monitored for 1 year.
   The results showed that litter production was lower in 10-year-old
   secondary forests when compared with older forests. On the other hand,
   in the 10-year-old forests, annual litter production represents 47.8\%
   of the stored biomass, while in mature forests annual litter production
   represents only 4\%. We found that structural variables (basal area,
   number of stems and canopy opening) influence significantly litter
   production, as well as litter as percentage of forest biomass. The study
   emphasizes the importance of biomass production through litterfall in
   regenerating tropical forests, and its importance for carbon storage and
   for the maintenance of ecosystem services.},

Abstract = {Large-scale and long-term restoration efforts are urgently needed to
   reverse historical global trends of deforestation and forest degradation
   in the tropics. Restoration of forests within landscapes offers multiple
   social, economic, and environmental benefits that enhance lives of local
   people, mitigate effects of climate change, increase food security, and
   safeguard soil and water resources. Despite rapidly growing knowledge
   regarding the extent and feasibility of natural regeneration and the
   environmental and economic benefits of naturally regenerating forests in
   the tropics, tree planting remains the major focus of restoration
   programs. Natural regeneration is often ignored as a viable land-use
   option. Here, we assemble a set of 16 original papers that provide an
   overview of the ecological, economic, and social dimensions of forest
   and landscape restoration (FLR), a relatively new approach to forest
   restoration that aims to regain ecological integrity and enhance human
   well-being in deforested or degraded forest landscapes. The papers
   describe how spontaneous (passive) and assisted natural regeneration can
   contribute to achieving multiple social and ecological benefits. Forest
   and landscape restoration is centered on the people who live and work in
   the landscape and whose livelihoods will benefit and diversify through
   restoration activities inside and outside of farms. Given the scale of
   degraded forestland and the need to mitigate climate change and meet
   human development needs in the tropics, harnessing the potential of
   natural regeneration will play an essential role in achieving the
   ambitious goals that motivate global restoration initiatives.

Pages = {377-389},
Abstract = {The objective of the present study was to verify if, in floristic terms
   of natural regeneration, a restored bauxite mine in southeast Brazil can
   be considered successfully restored. Forty plots of 3.0 x 3.0 m were
   allocated in the area. All shrubs and trees with height >= 0.30 m and
   diameter at 1.30 m height (DBH) <= 5.0 cm were identified and classified
   into successional categories and dispersal syndromes; DSL (diameter at
   soil level) and height were measured. We use the canonical
   correspondence analysis (CCA) to verify the correlations between
   environmental variables (canopy openness, litter decomposition, soil
   penetration resistance) and vegetation. We found 705 individuals, 80
   species and 30 families. The families with the highest species richness
   were Fabaceae and Melastomataceae. The specie with the highest
   importance value (IV) was Myrcia splendens. Most species are the early
   secondary successional category and the zoochoric dispersion syndrome.
   CCA ordination indicates the formation of a group of species associated
   with less soil compaction and with low litter decomposition rate and the
   formation of another group associated with intermediate values of soil
   penetration resistance and litter decomposition rate. The results
   obtained after ten years of implementation of the restoration project,
   in floristic terms, are suitable. In other words, the area can be
   considered as successfully restored.},

Abstract = {The objective of this study was to evaluate the structure (horizontal
   and vertical) of a Deciduous Forest, located between the municipalities
   of Piratuba and Ipira (SC). 14.000 m(2) of tree communities were
   analyzed, sub-divided into 14 plots of 10 x 100 m, where all individuals
   with DBH equal to or greater than 4.0 cm were sampled and identified.
   For natural regeneration were sampled 560 m(2), divided into 14 plots of
   10 x 4 m. In the tree strata were sampled 2.125 individuals belonging to
   34 families, 80 genera and 113 species with a total density of 1.517
   ind. ha(-1). Natural regeneration were sampled 196 individuals belonging
   to 24 families and 49 species with a total density of 3.500 ind. ha(-1).
   Luehea divaricata Mart., Actinostemon concolor (Spreng) Mull Arg. and
   Parapiptadenia rigida (Benth.) Brenan had of value of increased
   importance (7,1\%, 7,0 \% and 5,3\%, respectively). Actinostemon
   concolor got high value Relative Natural Regeneration (18,1\%). The low
   percentage of natural regeneration of species as Luehea divaricata and
   Parapiptadenia rigida, respectively 3,7\% and 1,5\%, typical of EDF, may
   represent a maintenance commitment in the community. The study revealed
   the presence of exotic species with invasive potential, as Hovenia
   dulcis Thumb. These facts point to the importance of the adoption of
   management measures, since the forest fragment studied is advancing

Abstract = {Does the adoption of agroforestry by small farmers in the Brazilian
   Amazon promote secondary forest succession on the degraded pastures and
   crop fields? New results from a small-scale farm agroforestry
   demonstration project, the Rondonia Agroforestry Pilot Project (RAPP)
   that began in 1992 are presented in this paper. In 1992, 242 farmers
   were surveyed by a stratified random sampling protocol, 50 of whom were
   selected to participate in the RAPP, constituting its experimental
   group. The remaining 191 farmers served as a control group. Farmers from
   both groups were re-surveyed in 2002 (after 10 years) and again in 2010
   (after 18 years). Annual site visits to the experimental group farms
   were conducted from 1993 through 2003 to monitor agroforest plot
   development and management, and changes in pertinent socioeconomic and
   household demographic characteristics such as household capacity,
   production systems, and social participation. Differences in property
   size, number of people permanently residing on the property, and social
   participation were found between the experimental and control group,
   with the experimental group having larger properties, more residents,
   and more participation in mutual aid associations. Control group farmers
   were also more reliant on cattle production (based on 2009 sales)
   despite having similar amounts of pasture as farmers in the experimental
   group. Within the experimental group, very few differences were found
   between farmers based on the type of agroforestry plot: timber, mixed or
   non-timber. Remote sensing analyses reveal long-term (10 years+)
   spectral differences in terms of the similarity to primary forest of
   both the agroforestry plots and the entire properties of the farms in
   this study. Experimental group farmers with mixed or timber-based
   agroforestry plots allowed more secondary forest succession to occur in
   and around their plots than farmers with non-timber plots. Although, on
   average, farm properties have become less spectrally similar to primary
   forest since 1992, properties with agroforestry plots tend to have more
   secondary succession and/or primary forest on their land in 2011.
   Several example properties are shown to illustrate the tendency of
   farmers with agroforestry plots to allow more secondary forest
   succession to occur on their land. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by

Abstract = {The availability and quality of resources for herbivores in tropical dry
   forests (TDFs) vary in time and space, affecting herbivore guilds
   differently across spatial scales (both horizontally and vertically),
   with consequences to the distribution of leaf damage in these forests.
   We attempted to elucidate the distribution patterns of herbivorous
   insect guilds and leaf damage throughout the secondary succession and
   vertical stratification along the rainy season in a Brazilian TDF. With
   the advance of the succession, a greater richness and abundance of
   herbivorous insects were found, resulting in higher leaf damage in
   intermediate and late stages. This pattern, however, was not observed
   for the frequency of leaf miners. At a smaller spatial scale, the host
   tree height positively affected the richness and abundance of insects.
   The higher leaf damage was found in canopy, which also harbored a
   greater richness and abundance of chewing herbivores compared to the
   understory at both the beginning and the end of the rainy season.
   Although for sap-sucking insects, this was only true at the beginning of
   the season. We detected a decrease in insect richness and abundance at
   the end of the rainy season, probably due to a synchronization of insect
   activity with the availability of young, highly nutritious plant
   tissues. These results are consistent with other studies that found a
   general trend of increasing richness and abundance of herbivorous
   insects and leaf damage throughout the secondary succession (early to
   late stages) and between vertical strata (understory to canopy),
   suggesting that forest complexity positively affects herbivores.},

Abstract = {Tropical dry forests are the most threatened tropical terrestrial
   ecosystem. However, few studies have been conducted on the natural
   regeneration necessary to restore these forests. We reviewed the ecology
   of regeneration of tropical dry forests as a tool to restore disturbed
   lands. Dry forests are characterized by a relatively high number of tree
   species with small, dry, wind-dispersed seeds. Over small scales,
   wind-dispersed seeds are better able to colonize degraded areas than
   vertebrate-dispersed plants. Small seeds and those with low water
   content are less susceptible to desiccation, which is a major barrier
   for establishment in open areas. Seeds are available in the soil in the
   early rainy season to maximize the time to grow. However, highly
   variable precipitation and frequent dry spells are important sources of
   mortality in seeds and seedlings. Collecting seeds at the end of the dry
   season and planting them when soil has sufficient moisture may increase
   seedling establishment and reduce the time they are exposed to seed
   predators. Germination and early establishment in the field are favored
   in shaded sites, which have milder environment and moister soil than
   open sites during low rainfall periods. Growth of established seedlings,
   however, is favored in open areas. Therefore, clipping plants around
   established seedlings may be a good management option to improve growth
   and survival. Although dry forests have species either resistant to fire
   or that benefit from it, frequent fires simplify community species
   composition. Resprouting ability is a noticeable mechanism of
   regeneration in dry forests and must be considered for restoration. The
   approach to dry-forest restoration should be tailored to this ecosystem
   instead of merely following approaches developed for moister forests.},

Abstract = {Several studies in temperate forests have demonstrated effects of litter
   addition on decomposers and predators. However, adding litter does not
   allow separating the effects of food availability and habitat space. We
   investigated the response of decomposers and predators to increased food
   resources and space in forests of the southern Mata Atlantica of Brazil.
   In two forest ecosystems representing an early successional stage of
   secondary forests and old-growth forest, we added nutrient-rich organic
   material, artificial litter of no nutritional value, or a combination of
   both to the soil surface of 120 plots to separate the effects of habitat
   space and food on soil food webs. We sampled litter-and soil-dwelling
   arthropods after three months using pitfall traps, soil sample
   extraction, and sticky traps just above the soil. Adding artificial
   litter had no positive effect on any of the 17 analyzed arthropod
   groups. Combining all sampled arthropods the effect was even
   significantly negative. Adding food had a positive effect on the
   abundance of decomposers, but not predators. We found no interactions
   between added artificial litter and added organic material. Our results
   suggest that the soil fauna in tropical forests is food limited. The
   lack of a bottom-up effect on predators suggests that they are not
   predominantly regulated by the abundance of epigeic prey but rather by
   competition or predation.},

Abstract = {Given rates of deforestation, disturbance, and secondary forest
   accumulation in tropical rainforests, there is a great need to quantify
   habitat use and movement among different habitats. This need is
   particularly pronounced for animals most sensitive to disturbance, such
   as insectivorous understory birds. Here we use multistate
   capture-recapture models with radiotelemetry data to determine the
   successional stage at which within-day movement probabilities of
   Amazonian birds in secondary forest are similar to those in primary
   forest. We radio-tracked three common understory insectivore species in
   primary and secondary forest at the Biological Dynamics of Forest
   Fragments project near Manaus, Brazil: two woodcreepers, Glyphorynchus
   spirurus (n = 19) and Xiphorhynchus pardalotus (n = 18), and the
   terrestrial antthrush Formicarius colma (n = 19). Forest age was a
   strong predictor of fidelity to a given habitat. All three species
   showed greater fidelity to primary forest than to 8-14-year-old
   secondary forest, indicating the latter's relatively poor quality. The
   two woodcreeper species used 12-18-year-old secondary forest in a manner
   comparable to continuous forest, but F. colma avoided moving even to
   27-31-year-old secondary forest the oldest at our site. Our results
   suggest that managers concerned with less sensitive species can assume
   that forest reserves connected by 12-18-year-old secondary forest
   corridors are effectively connected. On the other hand, >30 years are
   required after land abandonment before secondary forest serves as a
   primary forest-like conduit for movement by F. colma; more sensitive
   terrestrial insectivores may take longer still. Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {Understanding secondary successional processes in Amazonian terrestrial
   ecosystems is becoming increasingly important as continued deforestation
   expands the area that has become secondary forest, or at least has been
   through a recent phase of secondary forest growth. Most Amazonian soils
   are highly weathered and relatively nutrient poor, but the role of
   nutrients as a factor determining successional processes is unclear.
   Soils testing and chronosequence studies have yielded equivocal results
   regarding the possible role of nutrient limitation. The objective of
   this paper is to report the first two years' results of a nitrogen (N)
   and phosphorus (P) fertilization experiment in a 6-yr-old secondary
   forest growing on an abandoned cattle pasture on a clayey Oxisol. Growth
   of remnant grasses responded significantly to the N + P treatment,
   whereas tree biomass increased significantly following N-only and N + P
   treatments. The plants took up about 10\% of the 50 kg P/ha of the first
   year's application, and recovery in soil fractions could account for the
   rest. The trees took up about 20\% of the 100 kg N/ha of the first
   year's application. No changes in soil inorganic N, soil microbial
   biomass N, or litter decomposition rates have been observed so far, but
   soil faunal abundances increased in fertilized plots relative to the
   control in the second year of the study. A pulse of nitric oxide and
   nitrous oxide emissions was measured in the N-treated plots only shortly
   after the second year's application. Net N mineralization and net
   nitrification assays demonstrated strong immobilization potential,
   indicating that much of the N was probably retained in the large soil
   organic-N pool. Although P availability is low in these soils and may
   partially limit biomass growth, the most striking result of this study
   so far is the significant response of tree growth to N fertilization.
   Repeated fire and other losses of N from degraded pastures may render
   tree growth N limited in some young Amazonian forests. Changes in
   species composition and monitoring of long-term effects on biomass
   accumulation will be addressed as this experiment is continued.},

Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2017},

Number = {4},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Large-scale forest restoration is a cornerstone of Brazil's new Forest
   Code and a key element in its National Determined Contribution (NDC) to
   emissions reduction. But the path to this target remains unclear due to
   a lack of information on its economics and implementation challenges.
   Here, we begin to fill this gap by developing a spatially-explicit model
   for Minas Gerais state that estimates the costs and benefits of native
   vegetation regeneration under different restoration approaches. Our
   results show that 36\% (0.7 million ha) of the Forest Code debt in Minas
   Gerais can be restored using only passive restoration, at a cost of US\$
   175 +/- 47 million. Adding lowcost assisted natural regeneration would
   increase that number to 75\% (1.5 million ha) at a cost of US\$ 776 +/-
   137 million over a 20 yr period. This would result in a potential
   sequestration of 284 MtCO(2)e. However, including the intensive planting
   methods needed to restore the remaining 25\% of highly degraded areas-to
   fully solve the Forest Code debt and result in a potential sequestration
   of 345 MtCO(2)e-would more than double the costs to US\$ 1.7 +/- 0.3
   billion. Our results emphasize the need to implement regional policies
   that take advantage of the natural regeneration potential as well as
   prioritize the restoration of areas key to ecosystem services.},

   mature rain forests, and floristic similarity (Jaccard's coefficient) of
   legumes between both forest types was only 34\%. Successional changes in
   legume vegetation shares and taxonomic composition were weak within
   secondary regrowth, though repeated slash-and-burn did affect legume
   vegetation. Legume functional composition changed along succession with
   high shares of potentially N-2-fixing lianas in young regrowth. We
   conclude that 1) the composition of legume species in the community
   differs strongly between secondary and mature rain forest but legume
   composition along regrowth does not provide an adequate criterion for
   the definition of optimum fallow periods, and 2) legume lianas assume a
   key functional role in biological N-2-fixation and ccosystem N-cycling
   especially early along succession.},

Title = {Assessing the extent of agriculture/pasture and secondary succession
   forest in the Brazilian Legal Amazon using SPOT VEGETATION data},

Abstract = {There has been growing concern about land use/land cover change in
   tropical regions, as there is evidence of its influence on the observed
   increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration and consequent
   climatic changes. Mapping of deforestation by the Brazil's National
   Space Research Institute (INPE) in areas of primary tropical forest
   using satellite data indicates a value of 587,727 km(2) up to the year
   2000. Although most of the efforts have been concentrated in mapping
   primary tropical forest deforestation, there is also evidence of
   large-scale deforestation in the cerrado savanna, the second most
   important biome in the region.
   The main purpose of this work was to assess the extent of
   agriculture/pasture and secondary succession forest in the Brazilian
   Legal Amazon (BLA) in 2000, using a set of multitemporal images from the
   1-km SPOT-4 VEGETATION (VGT) sensor. Additionally, we discriminated
   primary tropical forest, cerrado savanna, and natural/artificial
   waterbodies. Four classification algorithms were tested: quadratic
   discriminant analysis (QDA), simple classification trees (SCT),
   probability-bagging classification trees (PBCT), and k-nearest neighbors
   (K-NN). The agriculture/ pasture class is a surrogate for those areas
   cleared of its original vegetation cover in the past, acting as a source
   of carbon. On the contrary, the secondary succession forest class
   behaves as a sink of carbon.
   We used a time series of 12 monthly composite images of the year 2000,
   derived from the SPOT-4 VGT sensor. A set of 19 Landsat scenes was used
   to select training and testing data. A 10-fold cross validation
   procedure rated PBCT as the best classification algorithm, with an
   overall sample accuracy of 0.92. High omission and commission errors
   occurred in the secondary succession forest class, due to confusion with
   agriculture/pasture and primary tropical forest classes. However, the
   PBCT algorithm generated the lower misclassification error in this
   class. Besides, this algorithm yields information about class membership
   probability, with similar to 80\% of the pixels with class membership
   probability greater or equal than 0.8. The estimated total area of
   agriculture/pasture and secondary succession forest in 2000 in the BLA
   was 966 x 103 and 140 x 103 king, respectively. Comparison with an
   existing land cover map indicates that agriculture/pasture occurred
   primarily in areas previously occupied by primary tropical forest (46\%)
   and cerrado savanna (33\%), and also in transition forest (19\%), and
   other vegetation types (2\%). This further confines the existing
   evidence of extensive cerrado savanna conversion.
   This study also concludes that SPOT-4 VGT data are adequate for
   discriminating several major land cover types in tropical regions.
   Agriculture/pasture was mapped with errors of about 5\%. Very high
   classification errors were associated with secondary succession forest,
   suggesting that a different methodology/sensor has to be used to address
   this difficult land cover class (namely with the inclusion of ancillary
   data). For the other classes, we consider that accurate maps can be
   derived from SPOT-4 VGT data with errors lower than 20\% for the cerrado
   savanna, and errors lower than 10\% for the other land cover classes.
   These estimates may be useful to evaluate impacts of land use/land cover
   change on the carbon and water cycles, biotic diversity, and soil
   degradation. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {This paper aims at characterizing the tree species natural regeneration
   and evaluating the relation of this stratum to both the adult component
   and the environmental variables in a fragment of a cloud forest in Santa
   Catarina, Brazil. In each of 25 20 x 20 m plots, where the adult
   component and environmental variables have previously been evaluated,
   subplots of different sizes varying according to plants' height were
   then allocated as follows: Class 1-plants with a height varying from
   0.15 cm up to 1 m, being evaluated within 5 m(2); Class 2 - plants with
   a height varying from 1 up to 3 m, being evaluated within 10 m2; Class 3
   - plants with a height greater than 3 m and DBH smaller than 5 cm, being
   evaluated within 20 m2. Data have been analyzed with regard to the
   determination of diversity (Shannon index), evenness (Pielou), Natural
   Regeneration Index (NRI), similarity with the adult component (Jaccard
   and Bray-Curtis), floristic-structural organization (Nonmetric
   Multidimensional Scaling - NMDS) and their relation to environmental
   variables. A total of 518 individuals distributed in 28 species were
   sampled. The low values of Shannon index (2.51 nat/ind) and evenness
   (0.75) suggest low diversity and elevated ecological dominance. The
   highest NRI has been found in the species Symphyopappus itatiayensis
   (Hieron.) R.M. King \& H. Rob (19.36\%). The similarity with the adult
   component were of 0.45 (Jaccard) and 0.24 (Bray-Curtis), demonstrating a
   low overall similarity (< 0.50). The soil compaction was the only
   variable that has shown a relation with regeneration, which can be
   related to cattle's presence in the fragment.},

Title = {Ant community recovery in regenerating Caatinga dry forest following
   slash-and-burn agriculture},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {227},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The conversion of old-growth forests to agricultural fields, followed by
   abandonment, has resulted in worldwide expansion of secondary forests.
   Secondary succession can bring back many organisms, restoring ecosystem
   functions and services, but studies often focus on the recovery of plant
   rather than animal communities. Here, we investigate whether ground and
   arboreal ant species and functional groups recover during secondary
   succession in the Caatinga dry forest. We adopted a space-for-time
   chronosequence approach with 10 regenerating forest stands following
   slash-and-burn agriculture (8-54 years old) and five old-growth forest
   stands (no record of agriculture for over 100 years). We recorded 71 ant
   species (59 ground species, 27 arboreal, and 15 in both strata)
   belonging to 26 genera and six subfamilies. We found no significant
   differences in both taxonomic and functional diversities between
   regenerating and old-growth forest stands, considering the whole
   community and ground and arboreal ants separately. However, increases in
   plant biomass were positively related to taxonomic and functional
   diversities of ground ants, while arboreal ants remained unaltered
   across the entire biomass gradient. Species and functional group
   compositions did not differ between forest type. Nevertheless, increased
   similarity in plant biomass between regenerating and old-growth forests
   was positively related to species similarity for the whole ant community
   and ground ants, while arboreal ant species composition remained
   unresponsive. These findings suggest that either ant communities are not
   significantly altered by slash-and-burn agricultural practices or they
   recover quickly during secondary succession. Given that previous studies
   have documented the loss of ant species and functional groups due to
   increasing disturbance, it is reasonable to expect that these
   communities recover quickly as secondary succession progresses.},

Abstract = {Climbers are an important life form in the understory and canopy of
   tropical forests. They are characterised by constant root connection to
   the ground and use of other species, mainly trees, as support in their
   search for higher light. In addition, they have an important role in
   ecological succession in forest clearings, as they are able to develop
   rapidly in these environments. Climbers can have high species richness
   in the biomes in which they are present. Since climbers are of little
   economic importance, they are usually cut down without regard for their
   contribution to maintenance of biodiversity and to the structure of the
   forest. Floristic studies of climbers in Brazil are still scarce and
   more research is needed. Tine goal of our research was to develop a
   floristic survey and identification keys for the climbers of the Estacao
   Ecologica de Assis (EEA) in the cerrado biome of Sao Paulo state,
   Brazil. Sampling was carried out every two weeks over ten months, along
   trails and edges of forest within the EEA. Identification keys were
   built based on vegetative characters. Thirty-two climber species,
   belonging to 24 genera and 1 3 families were recorded. The families with
   the largest number of species were Bignoniaceae (8 species),
   Malpighiaccae (5), Apocynaceae (3) and Smilacaceae (3). The richest
   genera were Fridericia (4 species), Banisteriopsis (3) and Smilax (3)-
   Tine number of species recorded for the forest fragment reveals the

Abstract = {Evaluating the diversity of multiple taxa is fundamental to understand
   community assembly and to assess the integrity and functionality of
   tropical secondary forests. In this study, we analyzed the natural
   regeneration of tropical dry forests (TDFs) in three regions of Brazil
   using Hill-Simpson diversity, abundance and beta-diversity of trees and
   five groups of insects (herbivores, fruit-feeding butterflies, ants,
   culicid mosquitoes and dung beetles). Sampling was conducted in 39 0.1
   ha plots using a chronosequence approach (13 plots in early,
   intermediate and old-growth forests). We evaluated the contribution of
   three different levels to gamma-diversity: alpha (within plots), beta 1
   (among plots) and beta 2 (among successional stages), and further
   determined the relative importance of turnover (species replacement) and
   nestedness (differences in species number among sites) to beta 2. Our
   results showed that, unexpectedly, the Hill-Simpson diversity was
   consistently higher in early than old-growth stages for all regions, but
   varied more widely in the intermediate stages. For each group
   separately, the same trend was observed for butterflies, ants, dung
   beetles and herbivores and did not differ among stages for mosquitoes.
   Successional differences in abundance were only detected for trees
   (increasing along the gradient) and for mosquitoes (decreasing).
   According to our expectations, the additive partitioning analysis showed
   that beta 2-diversity contributed more to gamma-diversity than beta
   1-diversity, when all taxa were considered together and for most of them
   separately (except for butterflies and dung beetles). Most of the beta
   2-diversity was due to species turnover, but this contribution varied
   among groups and regions, with the highest turnover for herbivores and
   the lowest for dung beetles. Our results suggest that the Hill-Simpson
   diversity and changes in species composition (as given by beta
   2-diversity) are better indicators of forest natural regeneration than
   raw species richness, corroborating previous studies with plants and
   animals.},

   cassava cultivation with about 50 years in process of ecological
   Succession and where today there is a secondary forest and an Old
   Secondary Forest (OSF) corresponding to a forest area that has just been
   submitted to a selective wood extraction for use of the farm itself. In
   each one of vegetal areas, approximately 0.1 ha was delimited and in
   these ten conical collectors were randomized distributed. The litter

Journal = {FORESTS},
Year = {2021},

Abstract = {Amazonia is well known for its high natural regeneration capacity; for
   this reason, passive restoration is normally recommended for the
   recovery of its degraded forests. However, highly deforested landscapes
   in southern Amazonia require active restoration. Since restoration
   methods can shape the quality and speed of early forest recovery, this
   study aimed to verify how active restoration pushes sites stably covered
   with exotic grasses towards forest recovery. We evaluated early forest
   succession at active restoration sites, i.e., soil plowing, direct
   seeding of pioneer species, and seedling stock planting at low density.
   We analyzed forest structure, diversity, and species composition in two
   age classes, 0.5-3.5 and 4.5-7.5 years old. As reference, we evaluated
   sites able to naturally regenerate in the same region. We sampled 36
   active restoration and 31 natural regeneration sites along the Madeira
   River, southern Amazonia. Active restoration triggered succession to
   similar or higher levels of forest structure than sites where natural
   regeneration was taking place. The most dominant species did not overlap
   between active restoration and natural regeneration sites. The overall
   composition of species was different between the two restoration
   methods. Dominant species and size class distribution show that active
   restoration is performing successfully. Soil preparation combined with a
   high availability of seeds of pioneer trees resulted in a high stem
   density and basal area of facilitative pioneer trees. Planted seedlings
   added species diversity and increased density of large trees.
   Interventions to increase the odds of natural regeneration can be
   effective for non-regenerating sites in resilient landscapes.},

Title = {Fast natural regeneration in abandoned pastures in southern Amazonia},
Journal = {FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {370},
Pages = {93-101},
Month = {JUN 15},
Abstract = {Abandoned pastureland provides a prime opportunity for forest recovery
   of these degraded areas in the Amazon. Many factors impact forest
   regeneration, including time and intensity of pasture use before
   abandonment, and proximity of a source of propagules. Given these
   conditions, it is necessary to better investigate the effect of such
   factors on the natural regeneration of abandoned pastureland. Here we
   employed chronosequences to study secondary forest succession in
   abandoned pastures along the Madeira River, Rondonia, Brazil. We
   installed 314 m(2) plots in 36 abandoned pastures previously subjected
   to long-term use (average of 9 years), but now at different stages of
   natural regeneration. All tree species stems >= 30 cm in height were
   identified, and their diameter was measured at ground level. Using a
   historical series of Landsat satellite images, time of pasture
   encroachment ({''}encapoeiramento{''}), time of pasture use, and time
   since last use were all calculated. The percentage of forest cover
   adjacent to each plot was calculated using a circular buffer (120 m
   radius) overlaid on a land-cover classification. Model selection
   procedure was used to access the importance of four predictors on
   natural regeneration variables (species density, basal area, stem
   density). We sampled 6380 stems belonging to 202 morphospecies grouped
   into 138 genera and 51 families. The two most important species were
   Vismia guianensis and Vismia gracilis that together represented 40\% of
   abundance, 70\% of frequency, and 101\% of IVI (Importance Value Index)
   of the plants sampled. Most species (164) were recorded in a maximum of
   four out of 36 plots sampled. Species density increased by ca. five
   species per year after pasture encroachment. Occurrence of rare species
   increased with time following encroachment, while relative abundance and
   basal area of the main pioneer species decreased with the advance of
   forest succession. Time of pasture encroachment, time of pasture use,
   and time since last use had significant effect on natural regeneration,
   whereas cover of surrounding forest had limited influence. Although
   constrained by long-term use, ``natural regeneration in abandoned
   pastures occurred relatively rapidly based on the high occurrence of
   resprouting pioneer species, which formed secondary sites during the
   first years of succession. Afterwards, regeneration was incremented by
   the establishment of a number of late succession species. We conclude
   that forest restoration of abandoned pastures in the Amazon should use
   the natural potential of forest regeneration, considering both the speed
   and intensity of the process. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

Abstract = {The recovery of tree species composition after disturbance depends on
   dispersal either from nearby forests or from surviving individuals
   within the disturbed area. Understanding the influence of proximity to
   mature forests on species composition of regenerating secondary forests
   can help in predicting the trajectory of recovery from anthropogenic
   disturbances. Using forest inventory data from a chronosequence of
   regenerating secondary forests in the Atlantic Forest of southern Bahia,
   whereby transects were arranged from the edge of mature forest 100 m
   into the regenerating area, we calculated community weighted means
   (CWMs) for traits and the natural distribution ranges of species. We
   used Generalized Linear Mixed Models to investigate whether site
   characteristics such as forest age, distance from mature forest edge,
   soil chemical and physical properties, and canopy openness influence
   traits and natural distribution of regenerating secondary forest tree
   species. Results show that species traits were associated with
   regenerating forest age while the proportion of endemic and widespread
   species was associated with distance from mature forest and regenerating
   forest age. Irrespective of distance from mature forest, regenerating
   secondary forests recruit species with heavy and recalcitrant seeds, but
   this increased with regenerating forest age. Our results contribute to
   understanding the effects of forest fragmentation and in restoring
   forests after deforestation.},

Title = {Performance and cost of applied nucleation versus high-diversity
   plantations for tropical forest restoration},
Journal = {FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {491},
Month = {JUL 1},
Abstract = {How to best restore highly diverse tropical forests to deliver an
   affordable and effective legacy of biodiversity remains an ecological
   dilemma. We investigated both vegetation recovery and financial outcomes
   of forest restoration in applied nucleation and high-diversity
   plantation plots in the Atlantic forest of Brazil. We used a randomized
   block design with four replicates (40 ? 54 m plots) for each of the two
   restoration treatments and a control (natural regeneration). After six
   years, we sampled 50\% of the restored area and calculated all labor and
   input costs associated with both restoration establishment and
   maintenance. Overstory basal area, species richness and species
   diversity were highest in plantation and lowest in control plots.
   Understory density was also higher in plantation plots but density of
   shrubs and vines was higher in nucleation and control plots. There were
   no differences in understory species diversity or richness across
   treatments. When considering only recruited individuals, overstory
   density and basal area, and species richness in both over and understory
   was highest in nucleation plots. In comparison to plantation plots, the
   overstory composition of nucleation plots was more similar to control
   plots and there was greater variability across plots. The total cost of
   restoration was up to 34\% cheaper in nucleation (US\$ 4654.09 ha-1)
   than in the high-diversity plantations (US\$ 7038.05 ha-1). While
   high-diversity plantation restoration is currently the most widespread
   and prevalent approach, applied nucleation appears to offer an
   intermediate level of recovery speed and cost, and can be a valuable
   strategy that can strike a balance between passive and active
   restoration.},

Abstract = {Extensive tropical forest loss and degradation have stimulated
   increasing awareness at the international policy level of the need to
   undertake large-scale forest landscape restoration (FLR). Natural
   regeneration offers a cost-effective way to achieve large-scale FLR, but
   is often overlooked in favor of tree plantations. The studies presented
   in this special issue show how natural regeneration can become an
   important part of FLR and highlight the ecological, environmental, and
   social factors that must be considered to effectively do so. They also
   identify major knowledge gaps and outline a research agenda to support
   the use of natural regeneration in FLR. Six central questions emerge
   from these studies: (1) What are the ecological, economic, and
   livelihood outcomes of active and passive restoration interventions?;
   (2) What are the tradeoffs and synergies among ecological, economic, and
   livelihood outcomes of natural regeneration, restoration and productive
   land uses, and how do they evolve in the face of market and climate
   shocks?; (3) What diagnostic tools are needed to identify and map target
   areas for natural regeneration?; (4) How should spatial prioritization
   frameworks incorporate natural regeneration into FLR?; (5) What legal
   frameworks and governance structures are best suited to encourage
   natural regeneration and how do they change across regions and
   landscapes?; (6) What financial mechanisms can foster low-cost natural
   regeneration? Natural regeneration is not a panacea to solve tensions
   and conflicts over land use, but it can be advantageous under some
   circumstances. Identifying under what conditions this is the case is an
   important avenue for future research.

Abstract = {As part of a larger study evaluating several silvicultural techniques
   for restoring tropical moist forests on abandoned agricultural lands in

   Atlantic forest species was tested at three degraded sites,
   characterized by different soil types and land-use histories, within the
   Environmental Protection Area at Botucatu, SP. The species used in this
   study were Chorisia speciosa, Croton floribundus, Enterolobium
   contorstisiliquum, Mimosa scabrella, and Schizolobium parahyba.
   Scarified seeds of each of these species were sown in prepared seed
   spots in replicated, 0.25 ha mixed-species plots at an initial
   espacement of 1 m x 1 m at each site. Of the five species planted, only
   two, Enterolobium and Schizolobium, showed good seed germination,
   seedling survival, and early growth rates, averaging 4.1-4.6 cm stem
   diameter and 1.5-1.7 m height growth during the first 2 years after
   sowing. These two species constituted 88-100\% of the total stand
   density, which ranged from 1050 to 1790 stems ha(-1) at 2 years. Despite
   the poor performance of the other species tested, we observed that the
   natural regeneration of native forest species originating from remnant
   forests in the general vicinity of our study sites was significantly
   greater within the direct-seeded plots than in unplanted control plots

Title = {FIRE EFFECTS ON NATURAL REGENERATION IN SEASONAL SEMIDECIDUOUS FOREST},
Journal = {REVISTA ARVORE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {46},
Abstract = {Forest fire is considered a relevant environmental and ecological issue
   worldwide, as it causes population, ecosystem, and economic impacts,
   making monitoring and additional research necessary to understand
   post-fire forest recovery. Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate
   the changes that occurred in the natural regeneration stratum in a
   fragment of Atlantic Forest in the municipality of Vivosa (MG), with and
   without the occurrence of fire. The phytosociological parameters and the
   functional diversity of the plant community were evaluated through 20
   plots, 10 in the burnt area and 10 in the unburnt area, in 2018 and
   2019, to follow the natural regeneration. There were collected, in the
   burnt and unburnt areas, respectively, 113 and 126 individuals, 23 and
   16 species, and 13 and 9 botanical families. Piper sp.1, showed the
   highest values for the parameters: relative density, absolute frequency,
   and cover value, occurring in 100\% of the plots. Areas with occurrence
   of fire present higher species richness. Species of the genus Piper
   occur frequently in areas of Semideciduous Seasonal Forest with signs of
   disturbance. The highest Shannon diversity and Pielou equitability
   indexes were found in the burnt area. The Jaccard index and the cluster
   analysis confirm the formation of groups with low similarity, showing
   floristic heterogeneity between the two areas, and the disturbance
   caused by fire is considered an important aspect for this floristic
   differentiation to occur. Therefore, the occurrence of forest fire in
   areas of Atlantic Forest increased the diversity values of species, with
   an increase in the equitability index, showing low floristic similarity
   between burnt and unburnt areas.},

Abstract = {Extensive areas of secondary vegetation cover the Amazonian landscape
   and are becoming a prominent feature surrounding rounding rural
   communities. In areas where much of the land has been deforested
   secondary succession plays a vital role in maintaining the cycle of
   shifting cultivation. This paper examines rates of for est regrowth, or
   secondary succession, following agro-pastoral activity, as a process
   which sustains communities living in the Amazon. First, we examine the
   differences in rates of succession, and secondly, reclassify regrowth
   stages according to vegetation structure.
   We compare the late of succession at two study sites within the
   Brazilian state of Para Altamira (Lover Xingu Basin) and Igarape-Acu
   (Bragantina Region), a nutrient-rich soil and nutrient-poor soil area
   respectively. Altamira displays a rate of forest regrowth that is nearly
   twice as fast as Bragantina. Density, height, and basal area clearly
   distinguish between the rates succession in the Altamira and Bragantina
   regions. An eight year old fallow in Altamira has over four times the
   tree basel area of an eight year old fallow in Bargantina and a canopy
   which is nearly seven meters taller. The two regions' distinct rates of
   forest succession discard any uniform scenario for secondary succession
   in Amazonia, but point to similar features characterizing the over all
   process. Soil fertility and land use history emerge as the critical
   factors regrowth in these two regions.
   Our research has show that age alone cannot be used to predict stages of
   development of secondary succession, since local and regional
   differences in land use history and soil fertility can cause structural
   differences among sites within the same age class. Physiognomic
   parameters provide a mole consistent way of comparing secondary
   vegetation across sites and regions. We introduce a cross-regional
   classification system Sol successional stages based primarily on
   structural criteria. Succession is divided into three stages, initial
   (SS1), intermediate (SS2), and advanced (SS3). The features which
   uniquely identify each successional stage include 1.) the relative
   contribution of saplings (individuals < 10 cm and (3)2 cm DBH) and trees
   (individuals (3)10 cm DBH) to the total basal area, 2.) tree basal area,
   3.) average total height, 4.) mode total height, 5.) average DBH, and
   6.) the standard deviation of total height which indicates the degree of
   structural diversity among the plants. The relative contribution of
   saplings and trees to total basal area emerges as the primary indicator
   of each stage. From viewpoint of remote sensing and land use analysis,
   the difinition of structural parameters for regrowth stages is
   especially important, since structural features are associated with
   spectral data from satellite images. Regrowth stages based on structural
   criteria which can be identified independent of age will help facilitate
   the aggregation of cross-regional data sets, help to understand the pace
   of regrowth in relation to management strategies, and furthermore, aid
   the development of a basin-wide classification system of remotely sensed
   satellite images for secondary succession.},

Title = {Natural Regeneration After Gold Mining in the Peruvian Amazon:
   Implications for Restoration of Tropical Forests},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN FORESTS AND GLOBAL CHANGE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {4},
Month = {JUL 1},
Abstract = {Context: Gold mining is the most destructive activity in the natural
   forests of the Madre de Dios region in the southeastern Peruvian Amazon.
   Understanding the natural regeneration process of these degraded areas
   is necessary to develop forest restoration projects in such conditions.
   Aims: We aimed to evaluate forest recovery and identify the successional
   and structure patterns of vegetation governing natural regeneration over
   time.
   Methods: Structure, composition, richness, diversity, and successional
   status were evaluated in abandoned artisanal gold mine areas in Madre de
   Dios, southeastern Peru. Vegetation data were recorded in 61 plots of
   250 m(2) established in five sites varying from 1 to 19 years of
   abandonment. Vegetation in abandoned areas was compared with six
   undisturbed forests evaluated in previous inventories.
   Results: In the mining lands, tree density and basal area recovered
   quickly, while species richness and composition were slow. Forest
   recovery is an initial stage of transition from pioneer to early
   secondary species until at least 19 years after abandonment. The most
   abundant and frequent species were the fast-growing species Ochroma
   pyramidale and Cecropia engleriana. These species could be considered
   potential candidates to promote restoration plans. Pioneer species
   represented 63\% of the number of species in plots of 1-4 years, 57\% in
   plots of 5-7 years, and 50\% in plots of 8-19 years. Early and late
   secondary species represented 34 and 16\%, respectively, of the number
   of species in plots of 8-19 years. Abandoned mining and reference plots
   present less than 5\% of species in common.
   Conclusion: Our results highlight a slow natural regeneration process in
   areas for up to 19 years after gold mining. Species from different
   successional statuses were identified as potential candidates for
   recovering vegetation in such areas. Our findings may have important
   implications for further research focusing on the ecological restoration
   in tropical forests severely degraded by gold mining.},

Abstract = {The transition region between two major South American biomes, the
   Amazon forest and the Cerrado (Brazilian savanna), has been
   substantially converted into human-modified ecosystems. Nevertheless,
   the recovery dynamics of ecosystem functions in this important zone of
   (ecological) tension (ZOT) remain poorly understood. In this study, we
   compared two areas of cerractdo (a forest-woodland of the Brazilian
   savanna; Portuguese augmentative of cerrado), one in secondary
   succession (SC) and one adjacent and well preserved (PC), to test
   whether the ecosystem functions lost after conversion to pasture were
   restored after 22 years of regeneration. We tested the hypothesis that
   the increase in annual aboveground biomass in the SC would be greater
   than that in the PC because of anticipated successional gains. We also
   investigated soil CO2 efflux, litter layer content, and fine root
   biomass in both the SC and PC. In terms of biomass recovery our
   hypothesis was not supported: the biomass did not increase in the
   successional area over the study period, which suggested limited
   capacity for recovery in this key ecosystem compartment. By contrast,
   the structure and function of the litter layer and root mat were largely
   reconstituted in the secondary vegetation. Overall, we provide evidence
   that 22 years of secondary succession were not sufficient for these
   short and open forests (e.g., cerrado) in the ZOT to recover ecosystem
   functions to the levels observed in preserved vegetation of identical
   physiognomy. (C) 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The present research had as objective to evaluate the dynamics of the
   environmental recovery of waste dumps in calcary mining by analyzing the
   composition and phytosociological structure of natural regeneration. The
   study was carried out in a waste dumo located in Salto de Pirapora, sao
   Paulo, Brazil, with sterile piles abandoned since 1994 and 2013 and a
   native forest fragment, totaling three treatments. Twelve plots of 10 x
   10 m were allocated to each area, where all shrub-tree individuals with
   height above 1.30 m were sampled, identified and evaluated for their
   composition and phytosociological structure. The occurrence of natural
   regeneration in the sterile cells was observed with the increased number
   of individuals and species over time. The results indicate that the
   vegetation present in the waste dumps is in transition from pioneer
   forest to a more advanced successional stage. However, Leucaena
   leucocephala has established itself more expressively than other
   species, inhibiting the development of other species. Finally,
   management actions are suggested so that the ecological succession of
   the waste dumps is not compromised.},

Abstract = {Aims
   Understanding succession in tropical forest is an important aspect of
   vegetation science, but to date, successional processes in seasonally
   dry tropical forests (SDTFs) have received much less attention than
   evergreen humid tropical forests. We aim to fill this knowledge gap.
   Methods
   We investigated vegetation succession in SDTF areas consisting of three
   different successional stages (early, intermediate, late), and a
   SDTF-savanna ecotone in the municipal district of Juramento, north of
   Minas Gerais State, Brazil. Using twelve 400 m(2) plots in each area, we
   compared vegetation parameters and structural variables (absolute
   density and basal area) and examined the floristic composition of the
   tree component to find gradients of change.
   Important Findings
   We found evidence of species turnover along a successional gradient,
   with the intermediate stage showing the highest species richness and
   diversity. This was accompanied with a significant increase in the
   number of tree individuals and basal area from the early to intermediate
   successional stage. However, the intermediate and late SDTF successional
   stages were more similar in structure and floristics. The ecotone was
   the most species rich and was similar to the intermediate SDTF and early
   successional stage in species richness and floristic composition
   respectively. These results will have implications for guiding SDTF
   management and recovery programs.},

Abstract = {Aim: Livestock production is among the main anthropogenic disturbances
   in seasonally dry tropical forests. However, its effects on plant
   functional composition in dry forests is poorly understood. Our goal was
   to analyze the variation in both functional composition and functional
   diversity of plant communities under goat grazing and at different ages
   of fallow in a tropical dry forest. Location: Brazilian dry forest
   (Caatinga) in Rio Grande do Norte State, northeastern Brazil. Methods:
   We measured the height, leaf area, and specific leaf area of all
   shrub-tree and herbaceous species along a gradient of stocking rate,
   years of grazing, and age of fallow. Additionally, we quantified the
   foliar contents of nitrogen, phosphorus, and tannins in the tree shrub
   layer. We tested the effects of grazing and deforestation using linear
   mixed models. Results: Our findings suggest that the functional
   diversity of plant communities in the Caatinga is not altered when goat
   grazing and secondary succession are examined independently. However,
   the interaction of both factors has affected the functional diversity,
   particularly in the herbaceous layer. Although grazing influenced
   specific traits in the shrub-tree layer, the overall functional
   diversity remained unaltered by grazing, succession, or their
   interaction. Conclusions: Grazing does not interfere with the natural
   succession process nor diminish the functional diversity of plant
   communities in the Caatinga. Therefore, with appropriate management,
   grazing can coexist with the conservation goals of the Caatinga.},

Abstract = {Assisted Natural Regeneration (ANR) is a set of restoration strategies
   and interventions primarily based on natural regeneration, aimed at
   accelerating succession and providing multiple benefits in degraded
   ecosystems and landscapes. These strategies have the potential to
   significantly contribute to global Forest and Landscape Restoration
   efforts. However, ANR faces challenges due to limited recognition,
   support, and formal integration into relevant sectors and restoration
   policies, particularly in tropical regions. The dearth of evidence-based
   syntheses further compounds these challenges. To address this gap, a
   bibliometric analysis of selected scientific publications on ANR (n =
   208) from 1987 to 2023 was conducted, using Web of Science and Google
   Scholar databases. A systematic review was undertaken, using a subset of
   original research articles (n = 44), to synthesize published data on
   interventions, contexts, costs, and benefits of ANR and to identify
   major knowledge gaps. Analysis of bibliometric metadata revealed an
   increasing annual output of ANR publications in over 80 journals,
   encompassing various document types and authors from over 40 countries.
   Despite ANR's formal emergence in the Philippines, Brazil has taken the
   lead in both its research and implementation, and international
   collaboration in ANR research has grown. While ANR research focused
   mostly on ecosystem services and ecological outcomes, social aspects
   have been poorly studied. Diverse ANR interventions align not only with
   ecological restoration but also with integrated land management,
   biodiversity conservation, forest and landscape restoration, and forest
   management. The cost-effectiveness of ANR implementation, especially in
   restoration for carbon storage, exhibited considerable variability when
   compared to active tree planting, and varied with intervention types,
   time, land use history, and long-term costs. This synthesis provides
   critical insights and evidence to enhance the effective integration of
   ANR into restoration and reforestation programs and policies.},

Abstract = {Due to the loss of biodiversity and natural habitat because of the
   forests fragmentation, it is the needed to find alternatives that allow
   the recovery of these environments. Thus, this study aimed to obtain
   information about the potential of natural regeneration mechanisms (seed
   rain, soil seed bank, seedling bank and established natural
   regeneration) in a seasonal deciduous forest fragment in Santa Maria -
   RS state, in order to conserve and to recover these ecosystems. The
   study was conducted in a systematic way, having as a point of departure
   the demarcation of 14 sampling plots of 2000 sq m. From those plots, 70
   subplots were randomly selected to evaluate the natural regeneration
   mechanisms. The seed rain was evaluated during one year based on the
   material that was monthly collected and analyzed from the collectors. To
   the study of the soil seed bank, soil samplings of 25cmx25cmx5cm were
   taken and the collected material was monitored during 7 months,
   observing the seed germination. The natural regeneration was evaluated
   in two classes: seedling bank and established natural regeneration,
   where individuals h >= 30 cm and DBH <= 5 cm were identified and
   measured. The seed rain presented medium density of 1350 seeds m(-2), in
   which 73 species, predominantly arboreal, were observed. In the soil
   seed bank, 108 species were observed, in which 74 \% were herbaceous. In
   the seedling bank, 48 species were found and they were heliophilous and
   sciaphilous species, while in the established natural regeneration, 37
   species were found, prevailing sciaphilous. This study concluded that
   the species with the greatest potential to perpetuate in the studied
   area were Gymnanthes concolor, Soroceae bonplandii, Eugenia rostrifolia,
   Trichilia claussenii, Trichilia elegans and Dasyphylum spinescens, and
   they are highly indicated to the enrichment of the area. The species
   Myrocarpus frondosus, Cupania vernalis, Nectandra megapotamica and
   Syagrus rommanzoffiana showed certain restriction, depending on the
   silvicultural treatments in the forest to assure their perpetuation in
   the area.},

   total richness; richness and density of regenerating trees. Passive
   restoration strategy has been found to be successful in the study area
   as the observed values for the indicators (except basal area and
   biomass) were above reference values specified for a 12-year-old active
   restoration. Our results also show that for most of the indicators of
   restoration success, the reference values established for the evaluation
   of active restoration projects may be surpassed through unassisted

   index (H') is 2.11; whereas the equability (J) value of 0.67 is
   considered high compared to other seed bank studies. Cecropia hololeuca
   (28.9\%) and Solanum erianthum (18,7\%) are indicated as the most
   important species within the forest regeneration process. Results
   suggest that the seed bank studied indeed has the potential for
   promoting and guaranteeing an ecological succession process dynamics on
   degraded lands of similar ecosystems.},

Abstract = {Floristic surveys and diversity indices are often applied to measure
   tree species diversity in mixed tropical forest remnants. However, these
   analyses are frequently limited to the overall results and do not allow
   to evaluate the spatial variability distributions of tree diversity,
   leading to develop additional tools. This study aimed to estimate the
   spatial variability of tree diversity and map their spatial patterns in
   a Brazilian mixed tropical forest conservation area. We used indices to
   measure the tree species diversity (dbh >= 10 cm) in 400 sampling units
   (25 m x 25 m) from a continuous forest inventory. Semivariograms were
   fitted to estimate spatial dependences and punctual kriging was applied
   to compose maps. Mean diversity values were constant in the continuous
   inventories, indicating a forest remnant in an advanced stage of
   ecological succession. On the other hand, tree diversity presented
   spatial patterns identified by geostatistics, in which the dynamics were
   composed of heterogeneous mosaics spatially influenced by tree species
   with different ecological features and densities, gap dynamics,
   advancement of forest succession, mortality, and Araucaria
   angustilofia's cohorts.},

Volume = {169},
Number = {3},
Pages = {243-255},
Month = {OCT 1},
Abstract = {Forest structure and floristic composition were studied in a series of
   0.5 ha natural forest plots at four sites near Porto Trombetas in Pard
   State, Brazil, 11-12 years after being subjected to differing levels of
   above-ground biomass harvest and removal. In addition to undisturbed
   control plots, experimental treatments included: removal of most trees
   greater than or equal to45 cm DBH (low intensity harvest); removal of
   trees <20 and greater than or equal to60 cm DBH (moderate intensity
   harvest); clear-cutting (100\% above-ground biomass removal).
   Post-harvest basal area growth generally increased with harvest
   intensity, and total basal areas for trees greater than or equal to5 cm
   DBH were, at the time of our study, 60\% (in the clear-cut) to about
   80\% of those in the control plots. Biomass harvests stimulated
   recruitment and growth of residual trees, particularly in the smaller
   diameter classes, but had little effect on species richness for small
   trees, seedlings, vine, herbs, and grasses. Species richness for trees
   greater than or equal to15 cm DBH was greater in the control and
   low-intensity (74-75 species) than in the moderate intensity (47
   species) and clear-cut (26 species) treatment plots. While the tree
   flora within all harvest treatments was broadly similar to the
   undisturbed (control) plots and included similar numbers of species of
   the major plant families typical of the surrounding forests, the more
   intensive harvest treatments, especially the clear-cut, were dominated
   by a higher proportion of short-lived, early successional tree species.

Title = {A comprehensive floristic knowledge of a fragment of Semideciduous

Journal = {BIODIVERSITY DATA JOURNAL},
Year = {2024},

Abstract = {Background The ``Serra da Conc \& oacute;rdia{''} is part of the
   Atlantic Forest phytogeographical domain in the Brazilian state of Rio
   de Janeiro and it has a predominant phytophysiognomy of Semideciduous
   Seasonal Forest. This region underwent intense habitat loss and
   fragmentation during the 19 century, due to coffee plantations and later
   pastures. With th the decline of these activities, the areas were
   abandoned, triggering secondary succession. In 2002, the ``Parque
   Estadual da Serra da Conc \& oacute;rdia{''} was established in this
   region to preserve the remaining forest fragments. The updated list of
   vascular plants recorded in this protected area, published in the ``Cat
   \& aacute;logo de Plantas das Unidades de Conserva \& ccedil;\& atilde;o
   do Brasil{''}, is presented here, along with information on richness,
   endemism, and conservation status. New information The ``Parque Estadual
   da Serra da Conc \& oacute;rdia{''} houses 231 vascular plant species,
   of which 90\% are angiosperms, 10\% ferns and lycophytes, and 27\%
   endemic to the Atlantic Forest. Ten species are threatened with
   extinction, three are categorized as Endangered, and seven as
   Vulnerable. Although there have been expeditions in the ``Parque
   Estadual da Serra da Conc \& oacute;rdia{''}, they have been limited,
   resulting in a low number of records and the species richness for a
   protected area. This is notable considering the 2,130 Brazilian native
   vascular plant species recorded in the semideciduous seasonal forest of
   Rio de Janeiro. Our data indicates that floristic inventories of
   Brazilian protected areas could help highlight gaps in flora knowledge
   and support the proposal of effective conservation actions.},

   forests: Perspectives from complementary biodiversity dimensions},
Journal = {FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {483},
Month = {MAR 1},
Abstract = {Secondary forests occupy extensive areas in tropical regions, providing
   an opportunity to investigate their relevance to biodiversity
   restoration. However, determining the conservation value of secondary
   forests and evaluating their successional trajectories depends on how
   biodiversity is measured. Here, we explore different biodiversity
   dimensions to understand how bird assemblages recover from forest
   disturbance caused by small scale farmers in the Amazon. We sampled bird
   species through standard visual and auditory censuses in 24 small plots
   of 1-hectare distributed in a paired design of old growth forests and
   secondary forests from different age categories (early, middle and late
   succession). We used 12 biodiversity metrics to explore the taxonomic,
   functional, and phylogenetic dimensions of bird diversity. Total species
   richness and evenness was similar between secondary and old growth
   forests. In contrast, the number of passerine species and
   disturbance-vulnerable species were higher in the controls of old growth
   forests compared to secondary forests. The relative abundance of birds
   with distinct functional traits consistently differed between the
   secondary forests of different age categories and their old growth
   forest counterparts. Functional evenness and divergence increased with
   canopy height and basal area through forest regeneration. In contrast,
   bird phylogenetic diversity in secondary forests was higher compared to
   those found in old growth forests while accounting for forest types and
   age categories of secondary forests. Bird species tolerant to
   disturbances partially compensate the loss of avian taxonomic and
   phylogenetic diversity during the conversion of undisturbed forests to
   agricultural fields. Changes in functional evenness and functional
   divergence suggest that resources used by birds are altered along the
   secondary succession and that the niche complementarity among species is
   reduced in more intensively managed sites. Ecological succession can be
   highly complex in terms of taxa identity, their functional roles and
   evolutionary history. Therefore, measurements that explore distinct
   biodiversity dimensions are fundamental to understanding how species are
   organized in assemblages across time and space.},

Abstract = {To test whether Brazil nut (Bertholletia excelsa) requires a specific
   canopy gap size in order to regenerate, 50 gaps of varying size (25-712
   m(2)) and 20 understorey sites (each of 141 m(2)) were sampled in
   tropical moist forest at Riberalta, Bolivia. The density of Brazil nut
   seedlings (<1.30 m in height) and saplings (>1.30 m) was assessed at
   each site, and the light environment was determined using hemispherical
   photography to estimate the global site factor (GSF), which represents
   the proportion of total above canopy irradiance that is received below
   the canopy. Saplings only occurred in gaps >95 m(2) or >10.48 GSF,
   whereas seedlings occurred throughout a range of gap sizes and in the
   forest understorey. Regression analysis showed a highly significant
   relationship between Brazil nut sapling density against both gap size
   and global site factor (GSF). These results may contribute to the
   development of plans for sustainable management of this species, by

Abstract = {The process of secondary succession on degraded lands in the Amazon
   depends on their land-use histories. In this scenario, little is known
   about how animal communities respond to different types of secondary
   vegetation in the region. We examined the effects of abandoned cattle
   pasture, Vismia- and Cecropia-dominated regrowth on the abundance of bat
   species and community composition in the Central Amazon, Brazil, based
   on 11 netting sites and on landscape characteristics. We captured 1444
   bats, representing 26 species and two families (Phyllostomidae and
   Mormoopidae). Among the six most-captured Phyllostomidae bats, Sturnira
   lilium and Sturnira tildae had significantly higher capture rates in
   abandoned pasture, while Rhinophylla pumilio predominated in both
   Vismia- and Cecropia-dominated regrowth. An hybrid multidimensional
   scaling ordination revealed significant differences in the bat community
   among the three types of secondary vegetation. Phyllostominae bats were
   more common and richer in the less-disturbed areas of Cecropia-dominated
   regrowth, while Stenodermatinae species were more captured in abandoned
   pastures. Our results suggest that the type of secondary vegetation,
   together with its land-use history, affects bat community composition in
   the Central Amazon. The Phyllostominae subfamily (gleaning animalivores)
   was habitat selective and disappeared from areas experiencing constant
   disturbances. On the other hand, Stenodermatinae frugivorous bats often
   used and foraged in altered areas. We suggest that secondary vegetations
   in more-advanced successional stages can be used to augment the total
   area protected by forest conservation units.},

Abstract = {Fragments of the Atlantic Forest in secondary succession and with the

   and are places where initiatives such as the establishment of
   conservation units (CU) have been implemented. Identifying the different
   land covers and land uses within these areas is imperative for
   maintaining the forest, enhancing family farming and local and regional
   water sustainability. The aims of this research were (i) to identify the
   different vegetation covers and land uses in the surroundings of streams
   located within a CU in the Atlantic Rainforest of Pernambuco, NE Brazil;
   and (ii) test which of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index-NDVI
   or Enhanced Vegetation Index -EVI vegetation indices were the most
   effective for characterizing different vegetation covers. It was
   possible to verify two general categories of vegetation cover and land
   use: (i) dense ombrophilous Atlantic forest, with higher average NDVI
   (0.856) and EVI (0.535) in forest fragments with productive backyards of
   family farming and the polycultivation of species of agricultural
   interest; and (ii) soil with small sugarcane monoculture, with average
   NDVI (0.763) and EVI (0.507) corresponding to the area of capoeira 3 in
   the early stages of regeneration. The EVI indicated greater
   correspondence with the findings of the field activities, better
   differentiating the dense forest fragments from the other targets, such
   as agricultural crops and exposed soil. We found that there are
   fragments of dense Atlantic ombrophilous forest with a tendency for the
   NDVI and EVI vegetation indices to increase in three of the four soils

Title = {Loss of secondary-forest resilience by land-use intensification in the
   Amazon},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {103},
Number = {1},
Pages = {67-77},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {1. Understanding how land-use intensification affects forest resilience
   is a key for elucidating the mechanisms underlying regeneration
   processes and for planning more sustainable land-use systems. Here, we
   evaluate how the intensification of a swidden cultivation system affects
   secondary-forest resilience in the Amazon.
   2. Along a gradient of land-use intensity, we analysed the relative role
   of management intensity, soil properties and landscape configuration in
   determining the resilience of early secondary forests (SFs). We assessed
   resilience as the recovery level of forest structure and species
   diversity achieved by SFs 5 years after abandonment. We used as a
   reference the recovery level achieved by SFs subjected to the lowest
   intensity of use, given that these SFs are part of a dynamic system and
   may not develop to old-growth forests. Therefore, we interpreted a
   deviation from this reference level as a change in forest resilience.
   3. The recovery of forest structure was determined by management
   intensity, while the recovery of species diversity was driven by
   landscape configuration. With increasing number of cycles and weeding
   frequency along with decreasing fallow period and patch area, SF basal
   area and canopy height decreased, regeneration shifted from a seed-to
   sprout-dependent strategy, and liana infestation on trees increased.
   With decreasing area covered by old-growth forest, species richness and
   Shannon diversity decreased.
   4. Secondary-forest resilience decreased with land-use intensification,
   mainly mediated by the effect of management intensity upon regeneration
   strategies. Our findings demonstrate the - many times overlooked -
   importance of previous management intensity in determining the structure
   of SFs and highlight the importance of regeneration strategy for forest
   resilience.
   5. Synthesis. Swidden cultivation supports people's livelihoods and
   transforms landscapes in the tropics. The sustainability of this system
   depends on ecosystem services provided by SFs that develop during the
   fallow period. Land-use intensification reduces the resilience of SFs
   and ultimately may drive the system towards an arrested succession state
   that holds a lower potential to deliver ecosystem services to the
   Amazonian people. Under an intensification scenario, the adaptation of
   management practices is needed to guarantee the resilience of swidden

Abstract = {This study aimed to characterize the mechanisms of natural regeneration
   in a Mixed Subtropical Wet Forest remnant. The study was conducted in
   the National Forest of Sao Francisco de Paula, RS, Brazil, using six
   conglomerates (I ha), with 16 plots (20 x 20 m) each, disregarding 10 m
   surround. The sampling of the seed rain (SR) was carried out in 96
   circular collectors (1 m(2)), distributed in the center of each plot.
   The soil seed bank (SB) was sampled randomly in a distance of 3 m of
   each SR collector and the seedling bank (SeB) was sampled in plots of 2
   x 2 m, located 4 m from SR collectors, counting the number of
   individuals (height >= 30 cm and diameter at breast height (DBH) < 1 cm)
   for each species. The regeneration mechanisms were evaluated through the
   floristic composition and horizontal structure. In SR, were sampled 81
   species, 46 genera and 28 families, in SB, 103, 65 and 41, and in SeB,
   88, 57 and 36, respectively The richness found and the presence of
   species with abundant fruiting and seed dispersal by animals, indicate
   the importance of seed rain as a strategic mechanism for the balance of
   flora and fauna in the ecosystem. The soil seed bank demonstrates
   potential for colonization and immediate restoration of vegetation after
   disturbances and the seedling bank is the main strategy for regeneration
   of many tree species that make up the current structure of the forest.},

Abstract = {The Amazon region harbors the most important tropical forest in the
   world. However, its biodiversity is seriously threatened due to land-use
   change. Here, we evaluated changes in tree species diversity and
   composition after shifting cultivation in the northern Amazon forest,
   Amazon state, Venezuela, through a chronosequence approach. We selected
   three sites over a 12 km(2) extension of an old-growth forest matrix
   with secondary forest patches of different stand ages. A total 45 plots
   (each having 20 x 50 m = 1000 m(2)) were established. At each site,
   woody plant diversity and the composition of trees having diameter 5 cm
   were assessed in four secondary forests (5, 10, 15, and 20 years old
   stands after shifting cultivation) and in one old-growth forest ( > 100
   years old), and three plots were established in each forest type.
   Species richness and dissimilarity pairwise beta diversity metric were
   calculated for paired plots among different forest types. We analyzed
   differences in diversity among the four successional stages and the
   old-growth forest using individual-based approach. Additionally,
   multivariate analyses were performed to examine differences among the
   sampled forest areas in terms of species composition along soil
   gradient. Species richness showed consistently increasing pattern along
   the succession to old-growth forest. Species richness in the old-growth
   forest was up to three times higher than in forests at early
   successional stages. Richness recovery rate in the 20-years old
   secondary forest two decades after the abandonment of shifting
   cultivation was on average equal to 70\% of the species richness in the
   old-growth forest. In contrast, the recovery of species composition
   reached an average 25\% in relation to the old-growth forest during the
   same period. Our results show that the effect of stand age and
   environmental drivers (i.e., soil properties) determine species
   diversity along succession. The environmental heterogeneity between
   successional stages can be analyzed by the differences in floristic
   composition and beta diversity observed among the analyzed plots. For
   that reason, we presume that beta diversity is the major determinant of
   species richness in secondary forests. The proposed approach contributes
   to the sustainable management of forest communities because it allows
   estimating the woody species diversity recovering after shifting
   cultivation disturbance across successional stages.},

Abstract = {The atlantic rain forest covered until the XVIIIth century almost all
   the littoral zone of the Brasilian stale of Santa Catarina. Nowadays
   only relictual occurrence of the forest can be found on the upper slopes
   of mountains. The valleys and slopes are now taken by agriculture and
   pasturage. By periodical abandonment of agricultural activities
   different secondary successional stages cover the slopes as mosaics. The
   source of the floristic elements which compose those formations are very
   different ecotopes like dunes, mountain summits, gaps, rocks and
   outland. As a result we observe very recent associations dominated by a
   small number of species in each successional stage. A parcial
   recuperation of the forest should be ensured by the fast successional
   dynamics which occurs on less lixiviated soils, by the availability of
   sufficient seed-trees and dispersers and by a conservation and
   management policy based on the maintenance of the climaxic forest
   structure and biodiversity.},

Abstract = {The capacity of natural regeneration of native species in situations of
   competition with forest plantation trees can be considered an important
   factor in maintaining diversity. Therefore, the present study evaluated
   the natural regeneration of native species in the sub-forest of a
   settlement of Eucalyptus saligna Smith., located on the Biological
   Reservation of Saltinho - PE. To estimate the natural regeneration of
   the arboreal species, three stands of Eucalyptus saligna Smith were
   selected. In each one of them, 10 sub-units of 1.0 x 50 m were
   implanted, one being on the edge of the stand and the others with a
   distance of 10 m one from another. The analyses were established based
   on the level of inclusion of the arboreal species in natural
   regeneration with circumference from stem to height of 30 cm from the
   soil - (CAB(0.30m)) <= 15 cm, and the classes of heights were
   distributed as follows: Class 1- arboreal individuals with heights (H)
   1.0 <= H <= 2.0; Class 2- with heights (H), 2 < H <= 3; and; Class 3-
   with heights (H) >3.0 m. To evaluate the floristic diversity at the
   species level, the Shannon index was used (H'). In total, 302 live
   individuals were sampled, belonging to 23 botanical families, 31 genera
   and 39 species. Based upon the results, it is possible to conclude that
   the Eucalyptus saligna tree does not preclude the natural regeneration
   of native species in the stand understory, however the floristic
   structure of the community is also influenced by edaphic factors and
   vicinity of seed sources.},

   absolute frequency, and relative frequency, the horizontal structure
   with Shannon's diversity index and Pielou's equitability index. The

Month = {FEB 15},
Abstract = {Global expansion of secondary forests results from old-growth forest
   conversion to agriculture and livestock fields, followed by abandonment.
   Dry forests heavily rely on resprouting for rapid biomass recovery, but
   some species depend on seed dispersers. Ants are important seed
   dispersers in dry forests, as they can transport seeds over long
   distances, help species join the soil seed bank, and promote seed
   germination and seedling recruitment. We investigated seed-dispersing
   ant community, ant-seed interactions, and seed removal rates and
   distances along a Caatinga dry forest secondary succession using forest
   stands (8-54 years) after slash-and-burn agriculture and old-growth
   forest stands. We observed 796 interactions with 29 ant species and four
   plant species. About 26.51\% were removals by 12 ant species, notably
   Dinoponera quadriceps and Ectatomma muticum, dispersing seeds up to 15
   m. Only 14\% of removed seeds reached nests while the rest were lost
   along foraging trails. Ant abundance of seed-dispersing ant community
   increased significantly with forest aboveground biomass, and both ant
   abundance and richness were significantly higher in secondary forest
   stands. Ant-seed interactions increased with biomass, being higher in
   old-growth forests. However, ant community composition, removal rates,
   and dispersal distances remained consistent across biomass and forest
   types. These findings may suggest that antmediated seed dispersal
   service quickly recovers during secondary succession, with implications
   for the dynamics of forest regeneration, given that ant-mediated seed
   dispersal is a prevalent and widespread phenomenon in the Caatinga dry
   forest.},

Journal = {ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {179},

Abstract = {The use of suitable ecological indicators for assessing and monitoring
   passive restoration is essential to understand the dynamics of natural
   regeneration and the restoration course. However, most developed
   restoration protocols in Brazil are specifically intended for monitoring
   active restoration. Only a few studies are addressing ecological
   indicators for passive restoration. In this context, we tested
   indicators defined by a monitoring protocol (SMA Resolution 32/2014)
   formulated for active restoration, along with other indicators of
   richness, diversity, and functional aspects of natural regeneration. The
   evaluations took place in sites under passive restoration in different
   age classes (between three and twelve years old) and in a secondary
   riparian forest (reference ecosystem) inside the Mixed Ombrophilous
   Forest (Araucaria Forest) in South Brazil. Those sites had previously
   been covered and degraded by Pinus taeda L. plantations. We compared the
   evaluated sites with the intermediate and final reference values
   proposed by the protocol to define the suitability of the tested
   indicators and the forest restoration process. Results showed that the
   canopy cover, density, and richness of regenerants are suitable to
   evaluate areas under passive restoration with a history of degradation
   by forestry. However, it is necessary to adapt the protocol's reference
   values. We further suggest the inclusion of other indicators related to
   the ecosystem's structure and functionality as the herbaceous cover,
   dispersion syndrome, life form, and the ecological group of species, as
   well the definition of indicator species for the different restoration
   levels. Despite the low similarity in composition, structure, and
   functional aspects with the reference ecosystem, the passive restoration
   showed potential to perpetuate the successional course in the studied
   areas.},

Abstract = {Majority of invasive trees colonize grasslands, shrublands, and

   the most pervasive invaders in Brazilian subtropical forests where it
   has changed their structure and composition. This study has aimed to
   identify the clues for its success by defining the structural and
   functional characteristics of plant communities in different stages of
   succession with and without Hovenia dulcis. Following the general
   assumptions of invasion ecology, we expected that Hovenia dulcis
   establishment and invasion success would be significantly higher in
   early successional communities, with high resource availability and low
   species richness and diversity, as well as low functional diversity.
   Contrary to this hypothesis, no differences were found between plant
   communities invaded and non-invaded by Hovenia dulcis at three different
   succession stages. No relationship was found between species richness
   and diversity and functional diversity, with respect to invasibility
   along the successional gradient. Hovenia dulcis is strongly associated
   with semi-open vegetation, where the species was found in higher
   density. The invasion of open vegetation is more recent, providing
   evidence of the species's ability to invade plant communities in early
   successional stages. We concluded that the colonization by Hovenia
   dulcis was associated with forest openness, but the species is also able
   to colonize semi-open vegetation, and persist in the successionally more
   advanced communities.},

Abstract = {A major global effort to enable cost-effective natural regeneration is
   needed to achieve ambitious forest and landscape restoration goals.
   Natural forest regeneration can potentially play a major role in
   large-scale landscape restoration in tropical regions. Here, we focus on
   the conditions that favor natural regeneration within tropical forest
   landscapes. We illustrate cases where large-scale natural regeneration
   followed forest clearing and non-forest land use, and describe the
   social and ecological factors that drove these local forest transitions.
   The self-organizing processes that create naturally regenerating forests
   and natural regeneration in planted forests promote local genetic
   adaptation, foster native species with known traditional uses, create
   spatial and temporal heterogeneity, and sustain local biodiversity and
   biotic interactions. These features confer greater ecosystem resilience
   in the face of future shocks and disturbances. We discuss economic,
   social, and legal issues that challenge natural regeneration in tropical
   landscapes. We conclude by suggesting ways to enable natural
   regeneration to become an effective tool for implementing large-scale
   forest and landscape restoration. Major research and policy priorities
   include: identifying and modeling the ecological and economic conditions
   where natural regeneration is a viable and favorable land-use option,
   developing monitoring protocols for natural regeneration that can be
   carried out by local communities, and developing enabling incentives,
   governance structures, and regulatory conditions that promote the
   stewardship of naturally regenerating forests. Aligning restoration
   goals and practices with natural regeneration can achieve the best
   possible outcome for achieving multiple social and environmental
   benefits at minimal cost.

Abstract = {The study was conducted in a Brosimum rubescens Taub. monodominant
   forest in Nova Xavantina, Mato Grosso state (14 degrees 49.8'S and 52
   degrees 9.6'W), in the transition zone between the Cerrado and Amazonian
   Forest in central Brazil. The structure and dynamics of the natural
   regeneration was compared over a five-year period to identify patterns
   that affect seedling establishment and explain the maintenance of B.
   rubescens dominance. We raised the following questions: how does the
   structure and dynamics of a monodominant forest regeneration vary over
   time? What patterns affect seedling establishment and help to explain
   the maintenance of the monodominance of B. rubescens? Natural
   regeneration was sampled in 30 plots of 1 m x 1 m (seedlings), 2 x 2
   (saplings), 5 x 5 (poles) and 10 x 10 (treelets). In the first
   inventory, the natural regeneration structure was characterized by a
   higher concentration of individuals in lower height classes and the
   largest number of seedlings of B. rubescens may be related to rainfall
   distribution in previous years. Seedling establishment may be limited by
   drier periods such as ``El Nino{''} events, or by specific light
   conditions reaching the forest floor. Formation of a persistent seedling
   bank may provide a competitive advantage for the regeneration of B.
   rubescens in conditions of gaps pre-opening thus contributing to
   monodominance maintenance. (C) 2012 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights

Volume = {15},
Number = {3},
Pages = {462-471},

Abstract = {The goal of restoration is to accelerate ecosystem recovery, but in
   ecosystems that naturally regenerate rapidly restoration techniques need
   to be selected carefully to facilitate rather than impede natural
   recovery. We compared the effects of five restoration techniques, such
   as plowing the soil, removing grasses, adding forest litter, seeding,
   and planting nursery-growing seedlings, on the regeneration of seasonal
   deciduous forest trees in four abandoned pastures in central Brazil. We
   monitored all woody stems immediately prior to treatments and again 14
   months after the treatments. We recorded an average of 16,663 tree stems
   per hectare and a total of 83 species before implementing treatments.
   Planting strongly increased species richness; adding litter and seeding
   had weaker positive effects on richness; and plowing and grass removal
   had no effect. Plowing substantially reduced the density of naturally
   established stems. Despite the high survival of planted seedlings, stem
   density in planting treatments did not change because the tractor and
   digging holes to plant seedlings caused mortality of naturally
   regenerating seedlings. Tree stems grew more in the grass release plots
   than in the control plots. Our results suggest that early succession of
   seasonal deciduous forest in pastures in the region studied does not
   need to be stimulated once the perturbation is stopped and that
   intensive restoration efforts may actually slow recovery. We recommend
   only enrichment planting of seedlings that are not able to resprout.},

Abstract = {Regenerating forests occupy large areas in the tropics, mostly as a
   result of deforestation for livestock and agriculture, followed by land
   abandonment. Despite the importance of regenerating secondary forests
   for tropical biodiversity conservation, studies of temporal effects of
   matrix regeneration on species responses in fragmented landscapes are
   scarce. Here, we used an Amazonian whole-ecosystem fragmentation
   experiment to investigate how changes in matrix quality over time
   through secondary forest regeneration affect bat assemblages from a
   functional perspective. We found that forest regeneration in the matrix
   positively affected functional a diversity, as well as species- and
   community-level functional uniqueness, reflecting an increase of species
   that perform different ecological functions in secondary forest over
   time. According to functional trait composition, animalivorous species
   showed the clearest signs of recovery associated with matrix
   regeneration. Consequently, between-period differences in functional
   beta-diversity were highest in secondary forest compared to fragments
   and continuous forest, determined mainly by trait gains. However,
   similar to 30 years of secondary forest regeneration were not sufficient
   for the functional recovery of bat assemblages to levels observed in
   continuous forest. Restoring degraded habitats while protecting primary
   forest will be an important strategy for safeguarding high functional
   diversity of bats and their vital contributions to ecosystem functioning
   in fragmented tropical landscapes.},

Abstract = {The encroachment of the logging frontier into Western Amazonia, where
   non-timber extraction has historically driven regional economies,
   provides an opportunity to explore the practice of multiple-use forest
   management. Families are now harvesting timber in their Brazil nut
   (Bertholletia excelsa)-rich community-titled forests, and we examined
   effects of formal and informal logging (with and without
   government-approved management plans, respectively) on forest
   disturbance and natural regeneration (individuals <= 10 cm dbh) of B.
   excelsa and 10 timber species in Northern Bolivia. B. excelsa
   regeneration densities 2-5 years after timber harvests did not differ
   between unlogged or logged (formally nor informally) sites; densities
   were, however, greater in larger logging disturbances (i.e., log
   landings vs skid trails), corroborating our model in which canopy
   openness explained regeneration densities. Regeneration of the two most
   valuable timber species, Swietenia macrophylla and Amburana cearensis,
   rarely occurred, and only where conspecific trees were felled, implying
   that population recovery of selected species may need post-harvest
   silvicultural interventions. In contrast, two other high-value timber
   species (Cedrela odorata and Dipteryx odorata) responded favorably to
   disturbances. Contrary to our expectations and reported industrial-scale
   findings, formal logging resulted in a larger percentage, but still
   acceptable level, of disturbed area than informal logging (10.6\% +/-
   0.65 SE vs 6.9\% +/- 1.26 SE; p = 0.047).
   Our overall finding that Brazil nut regeneration was unaffected by low
   logging intensities suggests that combined Brazil nut and timber
   harvests are compatible under certain circumstances. Still, adhering to
   legal requirements has been challenging for individual landholders.
   Preparing legally-required management plans without assistance is
   difficult, and individual landholders seek to harvest timber over
   multiple years, which is discouraged by formal logging that indirectly
   entails one-time extraction of nearly all commercial stems from the
   approximately 200 ha of forest landholders dedicate to timber
   production. Thus, reconciliation of legal requirements with community
   conditions is fundamental to long-term success of multiple-use forest
   management. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Seed arrival is a limiting factor for the regeneration of diverse
   tropical forests and may be an important mechanism that drives patterns
   of tree species' distribution. Here we quantify spatial and seasonal
   variation in seed rain of secondary forests in southern Bahia, Brazil.
   We also examine whether secondary forest age enhances seed dispersal and
   whether seed rain density and diversity in secondary forests decay with
   distance from mature forest. Across a chronosequence of 15 pairs of
   mature and secondary forests, 105 seed traps were installed and
   monitored for one year. We tested the effects of secondary forest age,
   distance from mature forest, and seasonality on monthly seed rain
   density, diversity, seed dispersal mode, and diaspore size. We found
   that secondary forest age had strong, positive effects on the diversity
   of seed rain, which was generally higher during the wet season.
   Moreover, contrasting patterns among diversity indices revealed that
   seeds of rare species occurred more often in 40 yr old secondary forests
   and mature forests. While the proportion of biotically and abiotically
   dispersed seeds did not change significantly with distance from mature
   forest across all forest age classes, we found that biotically dispersed
   seeds contributed disproportionately more to seed rain diversity. Our
   results emphasize the importance of biotic dispersal to enhance
   diversity during secondary succession and suggest that changes in
   secondary forest structure have the potential to enhance the diversity
   of tropical secondary forests, principally by increasing dispersal of
   rare species.},

Abstract = {The objective of the present study was to evaluate the early
   regeneration stage in previously deforested and cattle -occupied areas
   of high montane mixed forest in Sao Joaquim National Park, in the
   ``Planalto Sul Catarinense{''} region. The study was conducted in two
   areas in the early successional stage, which had already been
   inventoried in 2014 and 2018. In each area, 20 plots of 10 x 10 m were
   established in transects of 20 x 100 m. In 2022, the sites were
   inventoried again, with all living (>= 1 m in height and < 5 cm DBH -
   diameter at breast height), recruited (>= 1 m in height), dead, and
   outgrowth (>= 5 cm DBH) individuals recorded and identified (recruited).
   The effective richness (Number of Hill) and dynamic rates were
   determined for the inventory periods (2014-2018-2022). The results show
   that succession occurs in the areas as species richness increases and
   dynamic turnover decreases. We conclude that succession occurs with
   great spatial and temporal heterogeneity. Populations can be grouped
   according to their dynamic patterns (fast -slow) and ability to become
   established in the areas (winners -losers).},

   (DBH) of >= 5 cm were identified, resulting in a total of 1,461 plants
   per hectare. The floristic composition revealed 79 species belonging to
   31 families and 69 genera. The Fabaceae was the richest family in this
   study, having 14 species. Other families which presented a great number
   of species were the Myrtaceae (8), Meliaceae (6), Euphorbiaceae (5),
   Sapindaceae (5), Rutaceae (4) and Salicaceae (4). The species with the
   greatest importance values (IV) were the Gymnanthes concolor, Nectandra
   megapotamica, Trichilia claussenii and Chrysophyllum marginatum. The
   Shannon Diversity index and the Pielou Equability index were 3.49 nats.
   ind.(-1) and 0.79, respectively. A Twinspan classification analysis
   indicated three floristic subgroups in the forest patch. From these
   three groups, one was physionomically distinct because of its lower
   canopy and the predominance of tree fern species. The other two ones
   were characterized by tree species such as the Trichilia claussenii and
   Gymnanthes concolor, which are responsible for the large physiognomic
   group that characterized advanced secondary succession forests.},

Abstract = {(Structural analysis and considerations on the successional dynamic of
   two semideciduous forest fragments at the Municipal Botanical Garden of
   Bauru, SP, Brazil). Phytosociological parameters, as the frequency of
   height and diameter classes, are commonly used to make inferences about
   secondary succession in given phytocenoses. Shrub and tree individuals
   higher than 1.5 m and with a bole length of at least 1.3 m were sampled
   in 2,600 m2 of semideciduous seasonal forest in the Municipal Botanical
   Garden of Bauru (JBMB). Information on the diameter class frequencies of
   five species with the highest Importance Value Index (Ocotea pulchella,
   Protium heptaphyllum, Copaifera langsdorffii, Platypodium elegans and
   Trichilia pallida) and the more numerous species' successional
   classification were analyzed to make inferences about the successional
   features of the studied community. The diameter class frequencies of
   savannic species Vochysia tucanorum were also studied. The information
   obtained allowed to consider that the forest of the JBMB is at an
   intermediate successional stage, and that, although it used to be
   periodically burnt, some of its populations are able to renew
   themselves.},

Abstract = {The natural regeneration of tree species in forested areas has been
   studied by several researches. This study aimed to evaluate the natural
   regeneration of tree species in Corymbia citriodora (Hook.) K. D. Hill
   \& L. A. Johnson planted forest understory in Florestal, Minas Gerais,
   Brazil. Individuals with diameter at breast height (DBH) >= 5 cm were
   evaluated in seven 25 x 4 m plots randomly distributed. A
   phytosociological survey was carried out and the ecological groups and
   the dispersal syndromes of the regenerants were determined. We found 28
   species belonging to 12 families, among which Fabacea and Annonaceae
   stood out. Density was 1,557 regenerants ha(-1), and basal area was 23
   m(2) ha(-1). The most important species were Psidium sp; Schefflera
   macrocarpa (Cham \& Schltdl.) Frodin; Pera glabrata (Schott) Poepp. ex
   Baill.; Astronium fraxinifolium Schott \& Spreng.; Matayba guianensis
   Aubl.; and Plathymenia reticulata Benth. We found 35\% pioneer, 40\%
   early secondary, 18\% late secondary, and 7\% climax species, of which
   57\% are zoochoric, 40\% anemochoric, and 3\% autochoric. It is
   concluded that the natural regeneration in the understory studied
   comprises typical species of the Seasonal Semideciduous Forest of the
   Atlantic Forest biome, presenting significant density and individuals
   from all ecological groups.},

Abstract = {Tropical forests are converted at an alarming rate for agricultural use
   and pastureland, but also regrow naturally through secondary succession.
   For successful forest restoration, it is essential to understand the
   mechanisms of secondary succession. These mechanisms may vary across
   forest types, but analyses across broad spatial scales are lacking.
   Here, we analyse forest recovery using 1,403 plots that differ in age
   since agricultural abandonment from 50 sites across the Neotropics. We
   analyse changes in community composition using species-specific stem
   wood density (WD), which is a key trait for plant growth, survival and
   forest carbon storage. In wet forest, succession proceeds from low
   towards high community WD (acquisitive towards conservative trait
   values), in line with standard successional theory. However, in dry
   forest, succession proceeds from high towards low community WD
   (conservative towards acquisitive trait values), probably because high
   WD reflects drought tolerance in harsh early successional environments.
   Dry season intensity drives WD recovery by influencing the start and
   trajectory of succession, resulting in convergence of the community WD
   over time as vegetation cover builds up. These ecological insights can
   be used to improve species selection for reforestation. Reforestation
   species selected to establish a first protective canopy layer should,
   among other criteria, ideally have a similar WD to the early
   successional communities that dominate under the prevailing
   macroclimatic conditions.},

Abstract = {This study was conducted in a forest under restoration process, which
   belongs to the company Holcim Brasil S/A, in the municipality of
   Barroso, state of Minas Gerais (21 degrees 00' to 22 degrees 00'S and 43
   degrees 00' to 44 degrees 00'W), where 40 plots (2 x 2 m) were set,
   spaced at 10 m, forming eight strata parallel to the watercourse present
   in the area. Floristic composition and natural regeneration stratum were
   characterized, and the formed strata allowed evaluating whether the
   riparian vegetation and watercourse influence on the local regeneration.
   It was found 162 individuals of 13 families, 18 genera and 22 species,
   and 10,125 individuals/ha were estimated. Successional classes from
   pioneer and early secondary and zoochory dispersion syndrome prevailed
   among species and individuals. The watercourse and riparian vegetation
   did not exercise significant influence (p>0.05) on the number of species
   and regenerating individuals among the different strata of the forest.
   The diversity index of Shannon-Wiener (H') and equability of Pielou (J')
   were 2.691 and 0.870, respectively. The species Psidium guajava and
   Myrtaceae families presented the highest VI (value of importance).
   Natural regeneration analysis showed the low floristic diversity in the

Abstract = {In Brazil, a high number of woody species have been used for forest
   restoration plantings. However, this action is widely questionable due
   to the no re-establishment of a considered ``normal{''} successional
   trajectory. In this study, we analyzed subtropical rainforest natural
   regeneration at abandoned pastures and we showed that vegetation is
   characterized, predominantly, by few high dominant native woody species,
   highlighting especially Vernonanthura discolor (Asteraceae), Myrsine
   coriacea (Primulaceae), and Piptocarpha regnellii (Asteraceae). Our
   results also indicate that these high dominance species favor the lowest
   diversity of natural regeneration. In this regard, we suggest
   implementing actions that provide improvements and facilitate natural
   processes of ecological succession by planting dominant native woody
   species. This takes into consideration the re-establishment of a

Abstract = {The old, highly weathered soils of the lowland forest within the Amazon
   Basin generally exhibit conservative P cycles and leaky N cycles. This
   generalization applies to mature forests, but accelerating land use
   change is altering Amazonian landscapes. About 16\% of the original
   forest area has been cleared, and about 160,000 km(2) is in secondary
   forest cover. Secondary forests are common in agricultural regions, but
   few persist in one place for much more than 5 years. The nutrients
   within ephemeral forests are important for smallholder traditional
   slash-and-burn agriculture and in alternatives developed to conserve
   nutrients. Forest clearing causes an initial loss of nutrients through
   timber harvesting, fire, erosion, soil gaseous emissions, and hydrologic
   leaching, with N losses exceeding P losses. In contrast, the Ca, Mg, and
   K present in woody biomass are largely conserved as ash following fire,
   redistributing these nutrients to the soil. After the initial
   postclearing pulse of nutrient availability, rates of N cycling and loss
   consistently decline as cattle pastures age. Fertilization experiments
   have demonstrated that growth of young forests in abandoned agricultural
   land is nutrient limited. Several N cycling indicators in a secondary
   forest chronosequence study also demonstrated a conservative N cycle in
   young forests. Variable N limitation in young forests helps explain a
   negative relationship observed between the burn frequency during
   previous agricultural phases and the rate of forest regrowth.
   Recuperation of the N cycle gradually occurs during decades of secondary
   forest succession, such that mature lowland forests eventually recover
   abundant N relative to a conservative P cycle.},

Title = {Changes caused by forest logging in structure and floristic diversity of
   natural regeneration: Relationship between climate variables and forest
   dynamics in the eastern Amazon},
Journal = {FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {482},

Abstract = {Several studies indicate that the Amazon rainforest is home to the
   greatest biodiversity of tree species on the planet. The unique quality
   of this forest typology is under constant threat of change owing to the
   behavior of climate variables and different anthropic activities that
   occur in the biome itself. Therefore, it is essential to conduct studies
   that clarify the factors that affect the formation of forests in this
   ecosystem and to validate the use of forest resources by society through
   appropriate forest management practices. Thus, this study aimed to
   answer how the structure, composition and floristic diversity of the
   forest are influenced by forest logging in different phases of
   development of a local Amazonian forest, and whether there is a
   relationship between these attributes and regional and global climate
   factors. This study assessed the dynamics of natural regeneration of 36
   permanent plots over 33 years after logging in the Tapajos National
   Forest in Belterra, State of Para, Brazil. The plots studied were
   measured in 1981, 1983, 1985, 1987, 1992, 1997, 2007, and 2012. All
   individuals with height greater than 30 cm and diameter at breast height
   <10 cm were monitored in three regeneration strata (seedlings, saplings,
   and small trees) and three forest classes (gap-phase forest, growing
   forest, and old-growth forest). Density, floristic similarity according
   to the Sorensen Index, and floristic diversity according to the Hill
   series were analyzed. Climate variables such as mean annual compensated
   temperature; total annual precipitation, and Oceanic Nino Index were
   correlated with the mortality, recruitment, and density of growing
   trees. An ANOVA for count data verified that the density of individuals
   differed over time since logging among the regeneration strata and
   forest classes analyzed. Likewise, the diversity profiles generated from
   the Hill series were significantly different from each other, and the
   floristic similarity varied between regeneration strata over time. For
   the forest classes, the similarity values ranged between 50\% and 96\%.
   The gap-phase forest areas had the lowest similarity values, with some
   100\% dissimilar surveys. However, there was an exponential reduction in
   similarity over time in the different forest classes. The results
   indicate that logging promotes significant changes in floristic
   structure and diversity in different strata of natural regeneration and
   forest classes over time. Additionally, no correlation was found between
   climate variables and the natural regeneration dynamics in the Tapajos
   National Forest.},

Abstract = {The study was developed in the fragment situated in the Catende's - PE
   city (Mata das Galinhas 8 degrees 69'06{''} S; 35 degrees 69'08{''} W),
   in mesoregion of the pernambucana forest, more necessarily in the humid
   forest's microregion, at 142 km of the capital. The area's vegetacion is
   Humid Forest. The relief varies wavy to very wavy, with 199 m altitude.
   The soil is classified as red latisols dystrophic and red nitosols
   associated to latisols. The present work aims to study and evaluated the
   total natural regeneration of arboreal species in the forest fragment
   and to verify the diversity and structure of the species in the same
   one. For estimate the natural regeneration, were made systematically 16
   subunits (samples with 5 x 5 m). These subunits were inserted in the
   middle samples (10 x 25 m) before used to evaluate the community
   arboreal phytossociology, with 50 meters between the ones. The
   regeneration study (CAP <= 15 cm) was developed with heights divided in
   three categories (1 - individuals with minimum heights 1 <= 2 m; 2 -
   individuals with minimum heights 2 <= 3 m; 3 - individuals with heights
   > 3 m). Besides, the samply sufficient and diversity were calculated. In
   fragment was observed 31 botanical families and 60 arboreal species
   inside 194 individuals. 42 had been identified in level of species, 4 in
   sort level, 2 in family level and 2 are not identify. Ten species
   obtained bigest values for total natural regeneration of the samples
   population (RNT) and contribute with 53,78\% of the total percentage,
   how is descript following way: Brosimum discolor Schott (9,98\%),
   Protium heptaphyllum (Aubl.) Marchand (9,19\%), Eschweilera ovata
   (Cambess.) Miers (8,01\%), Thyrsodium spruceanum Benth. (7,0\%), Dialium

   (3,32\%), Cupania revoluta Rolfe (3,16\%), Sorocea hilarii Gaudich.
   (2,66\%), Cordia nodosa Lam. (2,52\%) e Tapirira guianensis Aubl.
   (2,50\%). These species had presented a good capacity of regeneration,
   probably they will be main responsible for the maintenance of forest's

Abstract = {We aimed at analyzing the dynamics of spatial-temporal variations of the
   early-successional wood and sub-woody components in an upper-montane
   community, in the municipality of Urubici, Southern Brazil. Within a
   20x100 m transect, all regenerative individuals, equal to or over 20 cm
   high and with diameter at breast height smaller than 5 cm, were
   identified, measured, tagged and spatially located (x, y coordinates).
   One and two years after the first survey, all sampled individuals were
   counted again, registering recruits and dead individuals. Demographic
   rates by size class and time interval (2014-2015 and 2015-2016), number
   of individuals of the most abundant species and spatial distribution of
   dead and recruits were detennined. We observed the increment of number
   of individuals and a greater participation of early-successional
   species. Smaller size classes and second time interval had superior
   values of mortality and recruitment rates. For both time intervals,
   recruits presented a clustered spatial pattern. Dead individuals showed,
   predominantly, a random spatial pattern. Results indicated structural
   instability, demographic rates variation regarding size classes and time
   interval, and distinct spatial pattern for dead and recruited
   individuals. We conclude that regeneration of the study area is still at
   an early stage of succession, presenting itself as a complex process,
   expressed by different spatial patterns of mortality and recruitment.},

Abstract = {This study aimed at characterizing the potential for natural
   regeneration of native vegetation in the under-story of an earlier
   Eucalyptus saligna Smith production stand. The study was carried out at
   the Parque das Neblinas, Bertioga municipality, SP, in a 45 ha third
   rotation stand; which had been abandoned 15 years ago for natural
   regeneration to occur. The sampling was done in 24 plots of 20 x 40 m.
   The sampled area was of 19,200 m(2), with inventory made of 100\% of the
   eucalyptus trees. All regeneration trees with a height >= 1.30 m and DBH
   >= 5.0 cm were measured, as well as adult individuals with DBH >= 5.0
   cm; surveyed in two size classes. 1,417 individuals of E. saligna were
   measured, with a density of 738,02 individuals/ha and a basal area of
   22.69 m(2)/ha. Among 2,763 natural regeneration individuals, 111 species
   belonged to 66 genera and 34 botanical families. The species represented
   43.7\% of the tree richness of neighboring native forest fragments. The
   total estimated density and the basal area were respectively 1,052.6
   individuals/ha and 6.4 m(2)/ha of autochthonous trees with DBH >= 5.0 cm
   (Class 1); while for regeneration there were 3,864.58 individuals/ha,
   and 2.76 m(2)/ha of individuals with a height >= 1.30 m and DBH <5.0 cm
   (Class 2). Shannon diversity (H') was 2.83 and 3.68, respectively, for
   Classes 1 and 2, and the corrected species richness for a
   1000-individual sample (R-1000) were 75.6 and 87.29 (Fisher's a index)
   for the same classes. The majority of the species (34.84\%) was typical
   from the understory of wet tropical forest and had zoochoric fruit
   dispersal (67.57\%). The results indicate that, under these conditions,
   a eucalyptus forest is able to provide adequate regeneration niches for
   native vegetation, and may represent a sink habitat for local
   populations.},

Abstract = {Questions: Are vegetation recovery trajectories converging or diverging
   during succession following clear-cutting? Are the trajectories
   approaching the species composition of surrounding old-growth forests?
   Location: Atlantic forest, Vale Natural Reserve, Linhares, southeast
   Brazil.
   Methods: A forest management experiment was established in an old-growth
   forest using 0.5-ha plots arranged in a randomized block design with
   five replicates. We analysed data collected from two treatments: plots
   that were clear-cut in 1980 without burning or tree stump removal, and
   control plots with old-growth forest that was left unmanaged. We
   analysed species abundance data (DBH10cm) recorded for both treatments
   between 6 and 33yr after clear-cutting. We computed mean
   multidimensional compositional distance of stands of the same
   successional age, and compared different ages to test whether
   trajectories during succession were divergent or convergent.
   Furthermore, we explored successional trajectories using ordination.
   Results: Regenerating stands were more similar to each other at 6yr than
   at 33yr after clear-cutting. Trajectories of the five recovering stands
   showed nearly monotonic divergence during succession and gradually
   approached the composition of surrounding old-growth stands.
   Furthermore, pioneer and non-pioneer species colonized the stands
   throughout the successional trajectory. Species recruitment occurred at
   different times and the species composition changed substantially during
   the 33yr after clear-cutting. As expected, species richness increased
   over time. Our findings suggest that successional trajectories have
   their own attractors: the surrounding old-growth stands towards which
   the composition of the regenerating community tends to return. Even so,
   33yr after clear-cutting, regenerating stands had distinctly different
   communities from surrounding old-growth forest.
   Conclusions: Secondary succession in the Atlantic forest shows that
   multiple, divergent trajectories which started with more similar species
   composition were directly influenced by their surrounding vegetation and
   gradually increased their similarities to the surrounding old-growth
   forest.},

Abstract = {Tropical secondary forests (TSF) are a global carbon sink of 1.6Pg
   C/year. However, TSF carbon uptake is estimated using chronosequence
   studies that assume differently aged forests can be used to predict
   change in aboveground biomass density (AGBD) over time. We tested this
   assumption using two airborne lidar datasets separated by 11.5years over
   a Neotropical landscape. Using data from 1998, we predicted canopy
   height and AGBD within 1.1 and 10.3\% of observations in 2009, with
   higher accuracy for forest height than AGBD and for older TSFs in
   comparison to younger ones. This result indicates that the
   space-for-time assumption is robust at the landscape-scale. However,
   since lidar measurements of secondary tropical forest are rare, we used
   the 1998 lidar dataset to test how well plot-based studies quantify the
   mean TSF height and biomass in a landscape. We found that the sample
   area required to produce estimates of height or AGBD close to the
   landscape mean is larger than the typical area sampled in secondary
   forest chronosequence studies. For example, estimating AGBD within 10\%
   of the landscape mean requires more than thirty 0.1ha plots per age
   class, and more total area for larger plots. We conclude that
   under-sampling in ground-based studies may introduce error into
   estimations of the TSF carbon sink, and that this error can be reduced
   by more extensive use of lidar measurements.},

   diametric structure, the PERD forest sample was shown to be in the
   later, and PESB forest sample in the earlier, stages of secondary
   succession. We found that tree species evenness and structural traits
   driven by succession were important factors in determining spider monkey
   abundance patterns. The PERD forest sample had lower evenness and had
   lower density of woolly spider monkeys than the Sossego forest sample.
   The lowest density of these primates was in the PESB forest sample, the

Abstract = {Soil seed banks are considered an important mechanism for natural
   regeneration in tropical forest ecosystems. This paper investigated the
   soil seed bank in two semideciduous seasonal tropical forest fragments
   with different disturbance histories in Botucatu, southeastern Brazil.
   In each study site, 40 superficial soil samples (30 cm x 30 cm x 5 cm)
   were taken at the end of both the dry and rainy seasons. The seeds were
   estimated by the germination method. Average soil seed density was 588.6
   and 800.3 seeds m(-2), respectively, for site 1 (less disturbed) and
   site 2 (more disturbed). Seed density and diversity (H') were
   significantly higher in site 2 in both seasons. Non-woody taxa
   predominated in both fragments, but pioneer tree species were better
   represented in the less disturbed forest. Both ecosystems have a
   potential for regeneration from soil seed banks, but this potential is
   higher in the less disturbed site. Low richness and density of pioneer
   tree species in the seed bank indicate that the ecosystem has lost its
   resilience. The seed bank is not as important in these ecosystems as in
   other forests. Results indicate that management strategies to restore
   these forests should take into account the possibility of recovering
   soil seed bank processes and dynamics. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {Cerrado is the second-largest Brazilian biome and an important area for
   nature conservation. However, little is known about the distribution of
   forest species in anthropized areas undergoing natural regeneration.
   Understanding the dynamics of ecological succession is fundamental to
   the decision-making process regarding revegetation of anthropic areas in
   the Cerrado. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate the phytosociological
   patterns of natural regeneration in areas anthropized by agricultural
   uses in the Cerrado in different soil and environmental conditions. For
   this purpose, the study was performed in an anthropized area that has
   been protected from anthropic actions since 2002. A floristic survey of
   forest species was carried out, and soil samples were collected at
   depths of 0-5, 5-10, and 10-20cm to determine the physical and chemical
   properties of the soil. The distribution of forest species with respect
   to the soil characteristics was determined using multivariate analysis.
   The distribution of the forest species was shown to be influenced by the
   soil properties and the degree of succession of the vegetation.
   Furthermore, the natural regeneration process resulted in an improvement
   in the chemical properties of soils in the Gleysol class. This pattern
   is related to the slow decomposition of organic matter, being associated
   with an environment that has greater water availability and,
   consequently, less nutrient loss from leaching during the cycling
   mechanisms responsible for the return of nutrients to the soil.},

Abstract = {The magnitude of the carbon sink in second-growth forests is expected to
   vary with successional biomass dynamics resulting from tree growth,
   recruitment, and mortality, and with the effects of climate on these
   dynamics. We compare aboveground biomass dynamics of dry and wet
   Neotropical forests, based on monitoring data gathered over 3-16 years
   in forests covering the first 25 years of succession. We estimated
   standing biomass, annual biomass change, and contributions of tree
   growth, recruitment, and mortality. We also evaluated tree species'
   contributions to biomass dynamics. Absolute rates of biomass change were
   lower in dry forests, 2.3 and 1.9 Mg ha(-1) y(-1), after 5-15 and 15-25
   years after abandonment, respectively, than in wet forests, with 4.7 and
   6.1 Mg ha(-1) y(-1), in the same age classes. Biomass change was largely
   driven by tree growth, accounting for at least 48\% of biomass change
   across forest types and age classes. Mortality also contributed strongly
   to biomass change in wet forests of 5-15 years, whereas its contribution
   became important later in succession in dry forests. Biomass dynamics
   tended to be dominated by fewer species in early-successional dry than
   wet forests, but dominance was strong in both forest types. Overall, our
   results indicate that biomass dynamics during succession are faster in
   Neotropical wet than dry forests, with high tree mortality earlier in
   succession in the wet forests. Long-term monitoring of second-growth
   tropical forest plots is crucial for improving estimates of annual
   biomass change, and for enhancing understanding of the underlying
   mechanisms and demographic drivers.},

Title = {Characterizing Canopy Structure Variability in Amazonian Secondary
   Successions with Full-Waveform Airborne LiDAR},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {16},
Number = {12},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Full-waveform LiDAR (FWF) offers a promising advantage over other
   technologies to represent the vertical canopy structure of secondary
   successions in the Amazon region, as the waveform encapsulates the
   properties of all elements intercepting the emitted beam. In this study,
   we investigated modifications in the vertical structure of the Amazonian
   secondary successions across the vegetation gradient from early to
   advanced stages of vegetation regrowth. The analysis was performed over
   two distinct climatic regions (Drier and Wetter), designated using the
   Maximum Cumulative Water Deficit (MCWD). The study area was covered by
   309 sample plots distributed along 25 LiDAR transects. The plots were
   grouped into three successional stages (early-SS1; intermediate-SS2;
   advanced-SS3). Mature Forest (MF) was used as a reference of comparison.
   A total of 14 FWF LiDAR metrics from four categories of analysis
   (Height, Peaks, Understory and Gaussian Decomposition) were extracted
   using the Waveform LiDAR for Forestry eXtraction (WoLFeX) software
   (v1.1.1). In addition to examining the variation in these metrics across
   different successional stages, we calculated their Relative Recovery
   (RR) with vegetation regrowth, and evaluated their ability to
   discriminate successional stages using Random Forest (RF). The results
   showed significant differences in FWF metrics across the successional
   stages, and within and between sample plots and regions. The Drier
   region generally exhibited more pronounced differences between
   successional stages and lower FWF metric values compared to the Wetter
   region, mainly in the category of height, peaks, and Gaussian
   decomposition. Furthermore, the Drier region displayed a lower relative
   recovery of metrics in the early years of succession, compared to the
   areas of MF, eventually reaching rates akin to those of the Wetter
   region as succession progressed. Canopy height metrics such as Waveform
   distance (WD), and Gaussian Decomposition metrics such as Bottom of
   canopy (BC), Bottom of canopy distance (BCD) and Canopy distance (CD),
   related to the height of the lower forest stratum, were the most
   important attributes in discriminating successional stages in both
   analyzed regions. However, the Drier region exhibited superior
   discrimination between successional stages, achieving a weighted
   F1-score of 0.80 compared to 0.73 in the Wetter region. When comparing
   the metrics from SS in different stages to MF, our findings underscore
   that secondary forests achieve substantial relative recovery of FWF
   metrics within the initial 10 years after land abandonment. Regions with
   potentially slower relative recovery (e.g., Drier regions) may require
   longer-term planning to ensure success in providing full potential
   ecosystem services in the Amazon.},

Abstract = {Guinea-grass (Megathyrsus maximus (Jacq.) B.K. Simon \& S.W.L. Jacobs -
   Poaceae) is an invasive C4 grass that known to slow ecological
   succession in restoration sites. This study aimed to evaluate the
   responses of the woody species and M. maximus itself to manual removal
   in a 20-year-old reforestation site. Forty-five 5 x 5-m plots were
   established in 2008 and evaluated until 2012. The plots were divided
   into three treatments: control (CON), manual removal for one year (MR1),
   and manual removal for two years (MR2). All individuals of woody species
   >10 cm were sampled. Canopy cover, grass cover, and the number of
   seedlings of M. maximus were also recorded. After the first weeding, M.
   maximus seedlings were manually uprooted every four months, for a total
   of three times in MR1 (2008-2009) and six times in MR2 (2008-2010).
   After the manual removal was stopped, the seedlings of M. maximus were
   counted and were allowed to grow in order to assess its reestablishment
   potential. The number of new grass seedlings decreased drastically after
   the first year with repeated removals and did not differ between removal
   treatments at any time, even after removals halted, indicating that one
   year of removal was sufficient to displace the grass. With the exclusion
   of Guinea-grass, an increase in the abundance and richness of other
   exotic species was observed until the second year. However, the increase
   in canopy cover during the four years likely benefited native woody
   species and impaired M. maximus and other exotics. In addition, after
   four years, although the woody species richness did not differ between
   the three treatments, the total abundance and pioneer species richness
   were higher in both removal treatments. These findings suggest that the
   grass slows ecological succession. However, both the increase in canopy
   cover and decrease in grass cover indicate that, in the absence of fire,
   native vegetation will suppress Guineagrass. Furthermore, grass removal
   from the understory of early secondary forests and reforestations can be
   used to accelerate succession, reducing both fire risk and failures of
   ecological restoration initiatives. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {The expansion of agricultural and pasture areas over native forest areas
   has been broadly documented and represents the main cause of
   deforestation that has occurred for the last decades. Such reality is
   not different in indigenous lands, and has been considered as an
   important obstacle for individuals who directly depend upon the
   appropriate management of natural resources to maintain their
   traditions. We investigated the seed rain, seed bank and natural
   regeneration of native woody species within a degraded pasture land in
   different distances from an adjacent seasonal semideciduous forest
   fragment to define methodological procedures based on ecological
   processes that might subsidize forest restoration in an indigenous land.
   Most seeds and seedlings picked from the seed rain and seed bank
   belonged to anemochoric and autochoric dispersing shrubby and herbaceous
   species originated in the pasture land. The woody species regeneration,
   on the other hand, reached higher levels, in terms of abundance and
   richness, as the forest fragment became closer. Zoochoric dispersal was
   predominant among such species and was mainly detected closer to the
   forest fragment. Several woody species picked in the forest fragment
   were also found in the pasture land, thus reinforcing their important
   role in supplying propagules and easing the successional process. (c)

   STRIPPING IN A TROPICAL DRY FOREST IN CENTRAL BRAZIL},
Journal = {REVISTA ARVORE},

Abstract = {Tropical dry forest trees have high resprouting ability, which may be
   useful for ecological restoration purposes. However, resprouting ability
   is affected by the type and severity of the disturbance. This study
   described the regeneration of trees through resprouting in a seasonally
   deciduous forest in Central Brazil, six months after being subjected to
   a gradient of disturbance. In order to expand a limestone quarry, 10 ha
   of deciduous forest were deforested in May 2013, creating areas with
   three increasing levels of disturbance: Clear-Cutting, Stump Removal and
   5-20 cm of Topsoil Stripping. Twenty 3.14 m(2) circular plots were
   randomly selected in each type of disturbance. All resprouts were
   counted and identified to species level. The plant organ where each
   resprout grew from and the distance of the resprout insertion to the
   soil were recorded. There were 27 species in the Clear-Cutting and Stump
   Removal areas, and 24 in the Topsoil Stripping site. Resprout density
   was 3.0 +/- 0.3(a)/m(2) in the Clear-Cutting, 1.7 +/- 0.4(b) in the
   Stump Removal and 1.4 +/- 0.4(b) in the Topsoil Stripping area (mean +/-
   SD; Tukey HSD). Stems contributed to 61\% of the resprouts in the
   Clear-Cutting area, while 60\% of the resprouts in Stump Removal grew
   from root collars and 70\% of the resprouts in Topsoil Stripping grew
   from roots. Underground resprouts emerged from a depth of up to 24 cm.
   An increase in disturbance severity negatively affected resprouting
   ability, but natural regeneration was high regardless of disturbance
   severity. The high resprouting ability of the deciduous forest trees
   provides resilience even after topsoil stripping.},

Abstract = {Aiming to contribute to the better understanding of this kind of
   Pantanal forest, the results from a floristic-structural survey
   performed in a 1ha plot commonly classified as ``Acuri Forest{''},
   located at RPPN SESC Pantanal (Municipality of Barao de Melgaco-MT,
   Brazil-16 degrees 45'S; 56 degrees 15'W) are presented. The floristic
   data were obtained from systematic collection of botanical material on
   the studied area and surroundings. The structural data were obtained
   from a one ha plot, divided into 100 contiguous sub-plots (10m x 10m).
   Inside these sub-plots, all arboreal individuals with diameter at breast
   high equal or greater than 5.0 cm, including palms, were identified,
   measured and mapped, using a coordinate system. 1224 individual ha(-1)
   were sampled, representing 44 species, 43genus and 27 families;
   diversity index H' = 1.613 (var. 0.003514). The highest diversity
   families were Fabaceae (9 spp.), Sapindaceae e Anacardiaceae (3 spp.
   each), Bignoniaceae, Malvaceae, Moraceae e Rubiaceae (2 spp. each).
   Among the sampled species, 39 \% were evergreen; 32 \% semideciduous and
   29\% deciduous. Considering the tree individuals total (n = 440), 51 \%
   were deciduos; 23\% semideciduous and 26\% evergreen. Attalea phalerata
   was the species with the highest structural value (VI = 121.62), due to
   its high density (64\% of the total sampled individuals), frequency
   (100\%) e and very high basal area (74.10 m(2) ha(-1)). On second level
   of importance were Anadenanthera colubrina, Triplaris americana and
   Phyllostylon rhamnoide (VI = 35.41; 28.51; 18.5 respectively). The
   studied area was identified as very peculiar comparatively with other
   Seasonal Forest areas, especially because the Attalea phalerata massive
   density and absence of Myrtaceae representatives. The high
   representation of pioneer species in association with high density of
   individuals within this successional category reinforces that Mata com
   Acuri represents an early successional stage or a transitional stage.
   Based on the great percentage of deciduous and semi-deciduous species
   recorded for the area of study, it was classified as being
   representative of Deciduous Forest.},

Abstract = {The analysis of changes in species composition and vegetation structure
   in chronosequences improves knowledge on the regeneration patterns
   following land abandonment in the Amazon. Here, the objective was to
   perform floristic-structural analysis in mature forests (with/without
   timber exploitation) and secondary successions (initial, intermediate
   and advanced vegetation regrowth) in the Tapajos region. The regrowth
   age and plot locations were determined using Landsat-5/Thematic Mapper
   images (1984-2012). For floristic analysis, we determined the sample
   sufficiency and the Shannon-Weaver (H'), Pielou evenness (J), Value of
   Importance (VI) and Fisher's alpha (alpha) indices. We applied the
   Non-metric Multidimensional Scaling (NMDS) for similarity ordination.
   For structural analysis, the diameter at the breast height (DBH), total
   tree height (Ht), basal area (BA) and the aboveground biomass (AGB) were
   obtained. We inspected the differences in floristic-structural
   attributes using Tukey and Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests. The results showed
   an increase in the H', J and alpha indices from initial regrowth to
   mature forests of the order of 47\%, 33\% and 91\%, respectively. The
   advanced regrowth had more species in common with the intermediate stage
   than with the mature forest. Statistically significant differences
   between initial and intermediate stages (p<0.05) were observed for DBH,
   BA and Ht. The recovery of carbon stocks showed an AGB variation from
   14.97 t ha(-1) (initial regrowth) to 321.47 t ha(-1) (mature forests).
   In addition to AGB, Ht was also important to discriminate the
   typologies.},

Abstract = {This study aimed at inventorying the natural regeneration of tree
   species in an Alluvial Araucaria Forest in the ``Planalto Sul
   Catarinense{''} region, SC, Brazil; evaluating the dissimilarity between
   its adult and regenerative components; and verifying the natural
   regeneration floristic sharing among its different fragments. The
   regenerative component has been sampled and identified within 48 plots
   and classified according to the following height classes: Class 1,
   plants with height varying from 15 cm up to 1 m; Class 2, plants with
   height varying from 1 and 3 m; and Class 3, plants with height higher
   than 3 m and DBH (diameter at breast height) smaller than 5 cm. The
   floristic composition of adult individuals in the area and of
   regenerative individuals from other fragments has been obtained from the
   database of the Laboratory of Dendrology of CAV/UDESC. The structure of
   the regeneration was evaluated by phytosociological descriptors.
   Dissimilarity between the adult and the regenerative components has been
   determined by Jaccard, Sorensen and Bray-Curtis distances. The
   regeneration floristic sharing analysis of different areas was conducted
   by a dendrogram. A total of 818 individuals belonging to 59 species have
   been sampled, being Allophylus edulis (A. St.-Hil. et al.) Hieron. ex
   Niederl. the species with the greatest relative importance. Elevated
   similarity between the regenerative and adult components have been
   observed (from 0.24 to 0.43), suggesting a low floristic-structural
   turnover between components. The area under study have shown a greater
   floristic connection (<40\% of dissimilarity) with other spatially close
   fragments, indicating that altitude and temperature are important
   ecological factors for its phyto-geographic compartmentalization.},

Title = {Variations in tree community composition and structure in a fragment of

Journal = {FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2004},
Volume = {198},

Month = {AUG 23},
Abstract = {In an area of tropical seasonal semideciduous forest, the soil
   characteristics, floristic composition, physiognomic structure, and the
   distribution of three regeneration and three dispersal guilds were
   studied for four stands within the forest that had documented histories
   of varying degrees of human disturbance. The aim was to study forest
   regeneration in areas of preserved forest and secondary forest, with
   parts of both types of forest experiencing either `intensive' or
   `occasional' cattle trampling. The study was carried out in the
   Sebastiao Aleixo da Silva Ecological Station, Bauru, Sao Paulo State,
   Brazil. Two stands were called `secondary' because they corresponded to
   forest tracts that were felled and occupied by crops and pastures in the
   past and then abandoned to forest regeneration ca. 40 years before this
   study. The other two stands, called `preserved', corresponded to areas
   of the fragment where the forest has been maintained with only minor
   human impacts. The arboreal component of the tree community (diameter at
   breast height or dbh greater than or equal to 5 cm) was sampled in 20
   plots of 40 m x 40 m, and the subarboreal component (diameter at the
   base of the stem or dbs < 5 cm and height greater than or equal to 0.5
   m) in subplots of 40 m x 2 m. Physiognomic features, such as canopy
   height and density of climbing plants, were registered all over a 5 m x
   5 m gridline laid on the sample plots. Soil bulk samples were collected
   for chemical and textural analyses. Most detected differences contrasted
   the secondary to the preserved forest stands. The soils of the secondary
   stands showed higher proportions of sand and lower levels of mineral
   nutrients and organic matter than those of the preserved stands,
   probably due to higher losses by leaching and erosion. Compared to the
   secondary stands, the preserved ones had higher proportions of tall
   trees, higher mean canopy height, lower species diversity, higher
   abundance of autochorous and shade-tolerant climax species, and lower
   abundance of pioneer and light-demanding climax species. Despite the
   high proportion of species shared by the preserved and secondary stands
   (108 out of 139), they differed consistently in terms of density of the
   most abundant species. On the other hand, the secondary and preserved
   stands held similar values for tree density and basal area, suggesting
   that 40 years were enough to restore these features. Effects of cattle
   trampling on the vegetation were detected for the frequency of trees of
   anemochorous and zoochorous species, which were higher in the stands
   under occasional and intensive cattle trampling, respectively. The
   density of thin climbers was lower in the stands with intensive
   trampling. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Journal = {FRONTIERS IN FORESTS AND GLOBAL CHANGE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {4},

Abstract = {The indigenous systems of agricultural and forest management in the
   Amazon are characterized by a deep knowledge of ecological processes,
   biodiversity, and the use and management of fire. The influence of these
   systems on the distribution of biodiversity includes semi-domesticated
   and domesticated species and landscapes, which have led to extensive
   anthropogenic or cultural forests. However, in many places, the
   livelihoods of indigenous peoples are being transformed by the
   intensification of agriculture and social, ecological, and economic
   changes, putting at risk the sustainability of production systems and
   food security and sovereignty of these peoples. In the last years, in
   the Xingu Indigenous Territory (XIT), the food production systems and
   the form of occupation of territories have changed, affecting the
   recovery of secondary forests, which now demand a too long period. The
   increase in the number and frequency of fires has aggravated this
   situation, due to a drier climate that has become predominant in the
   region. Changes in climate are attributed to deforestation in the
   neighboring municipalities, especially in the headwaters of the Xingu
   river basin. This study was conducted among the Kawaiwete (Tupi-Guarani)
   and the Ikpeng (Carib-Arara) peoples in the XIT, in the state of Mato
   Grosso, Brazil. The main objective was to develop alternative techniques
   of forest management based on indigenous and scientific knowledge more
   adapted to the new livelihood contexts, aiming to favor forest
   regeneration in areas dominated by shifting cultivation. We sought to
   answer the following questions: (I) How do forests regenerate during the
   fallow period? (II) How can local management improve forest
   regeneration? (III) Are there indicator species for secondary
   succession, soil recovery, and vulnerability to fires? (IV) Is the
   increase in the number of fires affecting the sustainability of the
   shifting cultivation systems? Our results show that some local practices
   based on indigenous knowledge have the potential to facilitate natural
   regeneration, such as choosing forest areas that have been recovered for
   agricultural use, limiting the number of cultivation cycles, protecting
   and selecting of individual trees during cultivation period, and
   attracting seed dispersers. Assisted natural regeneration strategies
   grounded on indigenous knowledge are promising ways to restore degraded
   lands of the XIT.},

   study evaluated trait-convergence assembly patterns and trait-divergence
   assembly patterns in successional areas of Araucaria forest. Plant
   species were sampled in both the upper and lower strata and were
   described by 15 functional traits. Data analyses were based on
   multiplication and Procrustes adjustment of matrices, which permit to
   discriminate trait-convergence assembly patterns and trait-divergence
   assembly patterns along the forest succession (our environmental
   variable), and the influence of phylogeny on these patterns. Initial and
   late forests were highly different in species composition, but the
   regenerating stratum was already more similar especially in functional
   terms. Traits related to the acquisitive-conservative trade-off (wood
   density, leaf nitrogen content, leaf area, leaf dry matter content)
   revealed strong convergent patterns of successional changes. Moreover
   divergence was maximized by specific leaf area, seed mass,
   deciduousness, and dispersal mode, showing a higher functional diversity

   Total Natural Regeneration Index (TNR) for each species. It was sampled
   a total of 3,516 individuals of 140 tree species varying from 10 cm to 5
   m height with diameter at the height of 1.3 m (DBH) smaller than 5 cm.
   The largest numbers of individuals were sampled in the families
   Rubiaceae, Fabaceae Mimosoideae, Monimiaceae, Fabaceae Papilionoideae,
   and the richest families were Fabaceae Caesalpinoideae, Fabaceae
   Papilionoideae, Euphorbiaceae, Lauraceae, Myrtaceae and Rubiaceae.
   Psychotria sessilis, Siparuna guianensis, Anadenanthera peregrina and
   Piptadenia gonoacantha presented the largest TNR. The comparison of the
   actual regeneration study with that of prior evaluations suggests a
   continuous substitution of species from initial to more advanced stages.
   These results indicate that the protection of the remaining forest
   fragments is important to maintain or improve the biodiversity in this
   region.},

   investigated changes in edaphic macrofauna density and diversity along a

   show some clear patterns of change in soil macrofauna along the
   chronosequence. Density did not increase along secondary succession, but
   was correlated with canopy cover. Diversity was characterized by high
   dominance of social insects and evenness among other groups. We conclude
   soil macrofauna has a high capacity to recolonize young forests and that
   its recovery is considerably fast compared to other ecosystem

Abstract = {The liberation of trees of interest by cutting competing trees, woody
   vines and other lianas is a very important silvicultural practice in the
   management of forest species of interest present in secondary forests.
   Thus, we aimed to know the influence of the liberation on the mechanical
   stability and what dimensional height limit of C. canjerana (Vell.)
   Mart. saplings must have so that there is no problem of buckling of the
   stem after the liberation. To this end, the liberation of 105 plants of
   the species was carried out and the diameter and height were measured
   before and annually for three years after the application of the
   treatment. Based on the Mechanical Design Theory, a regression model was
   generated to know to allocation mode of the diameter and height in the
   analized plants. The minimum diameter for buckling and the safety factor
   for all trees were calculated. The liberation resulted in the buckling
   of the stem of five trees, all below the safety limit, that is, with a
   real diameter smaller than the minimum diameter to support the weight of
   its height. According to the regression model generated the species
   grows proportionally in diameter and height. However, the liberation
   influenced the mechanical stability of the plants liberated, making a
   greater increment in diameter necessary so that the trees remained
   standing. The results demonstrate that the dimensions of the trees to be
   liberated should be considered in order to avoid problems of buckling of
   the stem after the treatment.},

   Brazil},
Journal = {FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {475},
Month = {NOV 1},
Abstract = {Agricultural practices have been occurring for centuries in the
   Brazilian Atlantic Rain Forest, which contains one of the highest levels
   of biodiversity in the world. The communities that still practice
   traditional shifting agriculture are constrained by legal, economic and
   social factors, which makes the practice of itinerant agriculture a
   complex dynamic process. The long-term effect of repeated, long-fallow
   shifting cultivation on plant communities in secondary forest fallows of
   various age and slash-and-burn history was examined in a quilombola
   village in Southeastern Brazil. We carried out vegetation surveys in 12
   sites, ten in areas of shifting cultivation and two in secondary forests
   formed after natural disturbances. We chose three age groups for
   sampling, i.e., post-harvest fallow or post-disruption times for natural
   areas. The fallow period after cultivation ensures the continuous
   recovery of the composition and structure of vegetation, but even after
   five decades the alpha and beta diversities had not reached the values
   observed in mature forests. The number of species and basal area
   increased over time but the differences between areas in the same age
   group were as large as between age groups. The two disturbed natural
   areas had lower richness than the fallow swiddens of the same age. The
   data suggest that the intensive extraction of non-timber forest products
   to supply the market, and therefore extraneous to traditional activity,
   has negatively affected the sustainability of the system. Actions to
   recover stocks of these forest products together with integrated
   management and input of resources can maintain the sustainability of the
   system.},

Month = {MAY 15},
Abstract = {We evaluated the impacts of selective logging on tree regeneration one,
   four, and eight years after harvests in Antimary State Forest in the
   State of Acre, Brazil. We inventoried tree seedlings, saplings, and
   poles (>50 cm tall to <10 cm DBH) on secondary roads, log landing, and
   skid trails, as well as in the bole and crown zones of canopy gaps
   created by felling; for comparison we also sampled areas not affected
   directly by logging. We compared these habitats on the basis soil
   (physical) characteristics, canopy cover, and floristic composition. For
   areas one and four years after logging, we supplemented the ground-based
   information with aerial LiDAR data. By eight years post-logging the size
   class distributions of tree regeneration in all habitat types resembled
   those in unlogged areas, and densities were only lower in crown gaps.
   Eight years after logging, relative densities of pioneer trees were
   highest on secondary roads and log landings; no among habitat
   differences were observed in the relative densities of non-pioneer
   species at any time along the chronosequence. Tree species diversity
   (Fisher's alpha) converged on unlogged values on skid trails, bole gaps,
   and crown gaps at 8-years post-logging, but values remained lower on
   secondary roads and log landings. Canopy openness was greatest one year
   after logging, especially in log landings (mean 45.4 +/- SE 4.5\%)
   whereas four and eight years post-logging it did not exceed 10\% and no
   differences were found among habitats. Soil bulk density was elevated
   relative to un-logged areas only on log landings one and four years
   after logging, and this difference disappeared by eight years post
   logging. The total area disturbed by logging varied from 7.0\% to 8.6\%
   with nearly half of the totals in felling gaps (3.0-3.7\%). (C) 2017

Year = {2019},
Volume = {453},
Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {Human-induced wildfires are one of the greatest threats to tropical
   forest and are predicted to increase in importance due to altered
   regimes associated with climate change. Wildfires promote high tree
   mortality, thus modifying forest structure and composition, and lead to
   habitat loss and fragmentation. Wildfires may also have effects on the
   adjacent unbumt areas due to edge influence; conversely, proximity to
   unburnt forest stands may favor regeneration in the burnt areas. We
   evaluated wildfire effects on the forest structure of Brazilian Atlantic
   forest remnants. We established 244 plots along eight 360 m-long
   transects distributed among three burnt patches, where we measured
   structural attributes of overstory, understory, and deadwood. The
   wildfire promoted very high mortality of trees, saplings, and lianas,
   changing substantially the forest structure. Our analyses showed clear
   differences between the burnt and unburnt areas but no clear gradients,
   highlighting the incipient stage of edge influence-related processes.
   The Neotropical bracken fern Pteridium arachnoideum was dominant in the
   burnt areas, which can possibly arrest secondary succession. Our results
   highlight the importance of wildfires as a menace to Brazilian Atlantic
   Forests remnants, as well as to tropical rainforests elsewhere - an
   ever-rising concern in a future of increased fire frequency.},

Abstract = {Interest in forest regeneration has increased as secondary forests in
   regeneration process are cited as the forests of the future. However,
   remaining forests are subjected to chronic anthropogenic disturbances,
   which may reorganize tropical biodiversity. This paper investigates the
   recovery of fruit-feeding butterfly assemblages following slash-and-burn
   agriculture in the Caatinga dry forest, assessing the roles that chronic
   disturbances, tree species richness and biomass play in their taxonomic
   and functional recovery during secondary succession. Butterflies were
   recorded monthly across old-growth forest stands and areas previously
   subjected to slash-and-burn agriculture, and with differing times since
   abandonment. While there was a high degree of similarity in
   community-level attributes among regenerating forests of different ages,
   secondary and old-growth forests supported relatively distinct
   assemblages, both taxonomically and functionally. As expected, chronic
   disturbance, forest biomass and trees species richness were excellent
   predictors of taxonomic and functional changes. Specifically,
   large-bodied and canopy-inhabiting butterflies reached higher abundances
   in more disturbed habitats, while those ocellus-bearing species that fly
   in the understory and feed on monocot as larvae responded negatively to
   disturbance, but benefited from increased forest biomass and tree
   species richness. Our findings suggest that although regenerating
   secondary forests can recover values of community-level attributes of
   fruit-feeding butterflies similar to those of old-growth forests,
   chronic anthropogenic disturbances across the landscape may be selecting
   only specific ecological groups that are tolerant to adverse
   conditions.Implications for insect conservationChronic disturbance can
   taxonomically and functionally alter butterfly assemblages across forest
   regeneration and consequently impact their ecological functions.},

Abstract = {The limitation of knowledge about auto-ecology of Ocotea odorifera
   (Lauraceae) in the preserved remnants indicates the need for further
   research to provide subsidies for the implementation of conservation
   programs. In this context, the present study aimed to evaluate the
   natural regeneration of Ocotea odorifera (Lauraceae), an endangered
   species, characteristic of the vegetation type of Araucaria Forest (FOM)
   occurring in Private Natural Heritage Reserve (PRNP) Uru, Municipality
   of Lapa, Parana state, Brazil. The national distribution of this species
   was lifted from museum collections of the available online data, and in
   the Curitiba Botanical Museum (MBM). To analyze the natural regeneration
   were set 10 circular plots of 40 m in diameter, containing an array of
   seeds in the center, totaling 12,560 m(2) sampling area. All
   regenerating individuals Ocotea odorifera contained in the plots were
   geo-referenced and measured their height and Diameter at Ground Height
   (DGH). It was also measured the thickness of litter and light intensity
   in each plot. Analyses were based on phytosociological parameters and
   the degree of species dispersion was assessed by Morisita Index (Id).
   The museum survey found 867 records Ocotea odorifera, compiled by 47
   national collections, occurring in 16 Brazilian states. The density of
   natural regeneration was 77.6 ind.ha(-1) and the growth pattern of
   population-inverted J, with greater abundance of individuals (44.71\%)
   with heights up to 0.50 m. The presence of seed trees in the PRNP Uru
   was limited to areas of FOM at an advanced stage of succession, and the
   sampling units with thicker litter were those with the highest number of
   measured individuals. The recognition of ecological potential,
   especially as the regenerative capacity and the factors influencing it
   in a natural environment, act as a basis for conservation actions to
   ensure the perpetuation of Ocotea odorifera.},

   year old early successional forests). Using digital image analysis, we
   obtained intrinsic measures of butterfly colour patches corresponding to
   hue, saturation, brightness, in addition to measures of the contrast
   among patches and of the overall wing-colour diversity corresponding to
   220 individuals, belonging to 60 species. Our results showed that
   butterflies in the secondary forest and continuous primary forest are
   more colourful than those found in early succession and fragments of
   forests. Individuals occurring in forests of early succession showed
   higher average values of hue and saturation, but lower brightness.
   Accompanying changes in colour composition, wing-colour diversity among
   species was lower in human-disturbed habitats, such as those of early
   forest succession and secondary forest. Forest fragments have smaller
   effects on butterfly colour composition, indicating that well-structured
   forest habitats can house butterfly assemblages with more diverse
   phenotypic features and colours. We show how high deforestation rates in
   recent years is linked with negative changes in functional coloration
   strategies (e.g. camouflage, warning colours), something that has to
   date been poorly explored or demonstrated for butterflies. Specifically,
   human interference has apparently placed butterflies under strong
   selection for lower diversity in their colours and range of defensive
   strategies. Those species that are most colourful are the first to be
   locally extinguished, likely due to removal of native vegetation and
   increased exposure to predators, and more broadly owing to inhospitable
   environmental conditions. This illustrates an accelerated loss of local
   fauna and a ``discolouration{''} of the Amazonian butterflies due to
   anthropogenic impacts.},

Abstract = {Deforestation and habitat loss are widely expected to precipitate an
   extinction crisis among tropical forest species. Humans cause
   deforestation, and humans living in rural settings have the greatest
   impact on extant forest area in the tropics. Current human demographic
   trends, including slowing population growth and intense urbanization,
   give reason to hope that deforestation will slow, natural forest
   regeneration through secondary succession will accelerate, and the
   widely anticipated mass extinction of tropical forest species will be
   avoided. Here, we show that the proportion of potential forest cover
   remaining is closely correlated with human population density among
   countries, in both the tropics and the temperate zone. We use United
   Nations population projections and continent-specific relationships
   between both total and rural population density and forest remaining
   today to project future tropical forest cover. Our projections suggest
   that deforestation rates will decrease as population growth slows, and
   that a much larger area will continue to be forested than previous
   studies suggest. Tropical forests retracted to smaller areas during
   repeated Pleistocene glacial events in Africa and more recently in
   selected areas that supported large prehistoric human populations.
   Despite many caveats, these projections and observations provide hope
   that many tropical forest species will be able to survive the current
   wave of deforestation and human population growth. A strategy to
   preserve tropical biodiversity might include policies to improve
   conditions in tropical urban settings to hasten urbanization and
   preemptive conservation efforts in countries with large areas of extant
   forest and large projected rates of future human population growth. We
   hope that this first attempt inspires others to produce better models of
   future tropical forest cover and associated policy recommendations.},

Abstract = {Riparian forests play an important role in stream ecosystems, as they
   support biodiversity, reduce water erosion, and provide litter that
   fuels aquatic biota. However, they are affected by great array of
   anthropogenic threats (e.g., fire, logging, and organic pollution),
   which alter species composition and their physical structure. Although
   forest recovery after disturbance such as logging can take decades, the
   legacy of forest clear-cut logging on key processes in tropical riparian
   ecosystems is mostly unknown. Here, we investigated how litter inputs
   (leaves, twigs, and reproductive parts) and storage, key processes for
   carbon and nutrient recycling and for forest and stream biota, are
   influenced by riparian vegetation undergoing succession (after 28 years
   from logging) through the comparison of reference and logged forest
   sites in the Cerrado biome. Litterfall was overall similar between
   forest types, but litterfall of twigs was twofold higher at logged than
   reference sites. Similarly, litter inputs from the bank to the stream
   (i.e., lateral inputs) and streambed storage were 50-60\% higher at
   logged than reference sites. The higher litterfall observed in logged
   forests could be related to higher proportion of tree species that are
   characteristic of primary and secondary successional stages, including
   fast-growing and liana species, which often are more productive and
   common in anthropogenic areas. Our results showed that the legacy impact
   of clear-cut logging, even if residual woody vegetation is maintained in
   riparian buffers, can shift the type, quantity, and seasonality of
   litter subsidies to tropical streams. This knowledge should be
   considered within the context of management and conservation of
   communities and ecosystem processes in the forest-stream interfaces.

Abstract = {This study aimed to identify natural regeneration in dense ombrophilous
   phytophysiognomy of the State Forest of Amapa, describing relations
   between vertical stratums. The study area is located in Porto Grande/AP,
   eastern Amazon. Three conglomerates were implanted, equidistant at 2.500
   m, for natural regeneration estimative. We used 100 plots of 10 x 10 m
   for study of saplings (5.0 < DBH (diameter at 1.30 m soil) < 10.0 cm)
   and sticks (5 x 5 m) (2.5 < DBH < 5.0 cm) in each conclomerate. We
   collected the heights and popular names. The heights were divided into
   three classes of regeneration to estimate phytosociological parameters
   of frequency and density, as well as regeneration by size class and
   overall. Diversity was estimated by Shannon Index. Floristic similarity
   between sticks and saplings was also analyzed. The inventory included
   2,700 individuals belonging to 38 botanical families, 93 genera and 141
   species of trees, with 6 undetermined. The Shannon index was 4.21
   (saplings) and 4.11 nats.ind.-1 (sticks). It has been found the
   occurrence of 33 common species in three classes of regeneration. The
   total natural regeneration varied from 10.3 to 0.1\% (sticks) and 5.6 to
   0.1\% (saplings). The species with the lowest percentages were
   Indeterminate, Vouacapoua americana, Carapa guianensis, Virola
   calophylla and Manilkara huberi. Thus, it is evident that species are
   developing their successional process efficiently, ensuring conservation
   of phytophysiognomy in the region.},

Abstract = {Tropical forests store large amounts of carbon and high biodiversity,
   but are being degraded at alarming rates. The emerging global Forest and
   Landscape Restoration (FLR) agenda seeks to limit global climate change
   by removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere through the growth of
   trees. In doing so, it may also protect biodiversity as a free
   cobenefit, which is vital given the massive shortfall in funding for
   biodiversity conservation. We investigated whether natural forest
   regeneration on abandoned pastureland offers such cobenefits, focusing
   for the first time on the recovery of taxonomic diversity (TD),
   phylogenetic diversity (PD) and functional diversity (FD) of trees,
   including the recovery of threatened and endemic species richness,
   within isolated secondary forest (SF) fragments. We focused on the
   globally threatened Brazilian Atlantic Forest, where commitments have
   been made to restore 1 million hectares under FLR. Three decades after
   land abandonment, regenerating forests had recovered \~{}20\% (72 Mg/ha)
   of the above-ground carbon stocks of a primary forest (PF), with cattle
   pasture containing just 3\% of stocks relative to PFs. Over this period,
   SF recovered \~{}76\% of TD, 84\% of PD and 96\% of FD found within PFs.
   In addition, SFs had on average recovered 65\% of threatened and
   \~{}30\% of endemic species richness of primary Atlantic forest.
   Finally, we find positive relationships between carbon stock and tree
   diversity recovery. Our results emphasize that SF fragments offer
   cobenefits under FLR and other carbon-based payments for ecosystem
   service schemes (e.g. carbon enhancements under REDD+). They also
   indicate that even isolated patches of SF could help to mitigate climate
   change and the biodiversity extinction crisis by recovering species of
   high conservation concern and improving landscape connectivity.},

   early, intermediate, and late successional stages of a tropical dry

   stages expressed by the Holdridge Complexity Index, showed that

   stages, while the Shannon Diversity Index indicated that species
   diversity was higher in the intermediate stage of succession. The
   Jaccard Similarity Coefficients showed that the intermediate and late
   successional stages had high similarity, whereas the early successional
   stage had low similarity with these two successional stages. Mortality
   rates were higher in the early stage, especially in stems with smaller

Abstract = {A lack of ecological knowledge leads to innovative tools for
   investigating spatial relationships in natural forests, among which
   geostatistics stands out as a set of statistical techniques for modeling
   and mapping. Thus, this paper aims to apply geostatistical analysis to
   map and correlate the spatial patterns and dynamics of the basal area
   for successional tree species groups in a Mixed Tropical Forest remnant
   in the southern part of Brazil. The floristic composition was obtained
   through continuous inventory conducted in 400 plots, where the basal
   area was evaluated for total stock and ecological groups: pioneer, early
   secondary, late secondary and climax. Subsequently, geostatistical
   analysis was used for modeling the spatial patterns of the basal area,
   and ordinary kriging interpolation was applied to compose thematic maps.
   The results show that the forest structure presents spatial dependence
   and heterogeneous distribution, in which the spatial behavior of
   successional tree groups is associated with species aggregation
   patterns. Moreover, spatial dynamics are influenced by basal area
   increment, in which spatial changes indicate a natural forest in an
   advanced secondary successional stage, reflecting a favorable
   conservation status. This shows the importance of Conservation Units
   policies as preservation strategies and biodiversity sources for forest

Abstract = {Leaf-cutting ants (Atta spp.) often increase in abundance following
   deforestation and may have an important effect on forest succession on
   abandoned land. In this study, we evaluated the effects of leaf-cutting
   ant (Atta sexdens) activity on physical and chemical properties of soil,
   root distribution, and tree growth in a 17-yr-old secondary forest in
   eastern Amazonia, Brazil. We compared the soil properties and root
   distribution in shafts excavated into five mature nests and at 15 m
   distanced from each nest mound. We evaluated the nest effects on
   vegetation measuring the stem diameter growth of nine tree species and
   predawn leaf water potential of the tree species, Banara guianensis,
   along a gradient of increasing distance from the nest mounds. The growth
   of seedlings (Cecropia sp.) in pots containing different proportions of
   mineral soil and organic matter removed from nest refuse chambers was
   also compared. The deep soil beneath A. sexdens nests at different
   depths (100, 200, and 300 cm) presented a low (fivefold, P < 0.01)
   resistance to penetration and was rich in Ca (three- to fourfold, P =
   0.06-0.02), K (7-14-fold, P < 0.05), and Mg (two- to threefold, P = 0.09
   for 200 cm depth) when compared to non-nest soil. These changes in nest
   soil properties were accompanied by increases in coarse root biomass (>2
   mm diameter, three- to fourfold) and fine root biomass (<2 mm, 10-50
   fold). However, stem diameter growth was generally not affected by
   distance from the nest. The growth of Cecropia sp. seedlings in a pot
   experiment was favored by the addition of organic matter from the refuse
   chambers. Banara guianensis trees experienced greater water stress (low
   predawn water potential) close to the nest mound, perhaps indicating
   increased competition for soil water that may have accompanied the
   proliferation of roots of several species in the nest. The competing
   Atta effects of defoliation vs. deep soil tillage and nutrient
   enrichment upon secondary forest growth are difficult to compare. Atta's
   modification of soil physical and chemical properties point to its
   potential role in facilitating the rapid recovery of deep root systems
   and soil water uptake previously observed in this secondary forest.},

Abstract = {Dryland tropical forests are important but little-understood ecosystems.
   These landscapes are at risk globally because of accelerated
   deforestation and the consequent losses of hydrological functions. An
   example is the Caatinga shrublands in northeastern Brazil; these dry
   tropical forests are undergoing rapid change as the land is converted to
   cultivated cropland and pastureland and then often abandoned after the
   land is exhausted, allowing forests to regrow. In this study, we
   evaluated how these changes influence soil hydraulic properties and soil
   erosion in Caatinga landscapes, by examining four sites of different
   ages: a recently abandoned pasture, a young (7years of regrowth)
   secondary forest, an intermediate (35years of regrowth) secondary
   forest, and an older (more than 55years) forest. Rainfall simulation was
   used to assess soil infiltrability and susceptibility to erosion. In
   addition, we determined hydrological conductivity in the field using the
   Beerkan method (Kfs) and collected samples for laboratory-determined
   measurements (Ks). We found that infiltrability and Kfs values were
   progressively higher as time since land abandonment increased, whereas
   Ks values were not significantly different across sites. Infiltrability
   was approximately 2 times smaller than Ks and Kfspossibly owing to the
   formation of soil crusts from raindrop impact. Soil erosion did not show
   a progressive improvement with forest age and was better explained by

Journal = {TREE PHYSIOLOGY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {44},

Abstract = {Amazonian species are generally unable to adapt to long drought periods,
   indicating a low capacity to adjust their hydraulic traits. Secondary
   forests account for 20\% of forest cover in the Amazon, making natural
   regeneration species crucial under climate change scenarios. In this
   study, we compared the hydraulic traits of five species, including
   non-pioneers (Bertholletia excelsa Bonpl., Carapa guianensis Aubl.,
   Hymenaea courbaril L.) and pioneers {[}Cedrela fissilis Vell., Tabebuia
   rosea (Bertol.) Bertero ex A.DC.], across light conditions (understory,
   intermediate, gap) in a 22-year-old secondary forest in Central Amazon,
   Brazil. Twenty-five saplings were planted and monitored in 3 plots x 5
   blocks. Five years after the plantation, we assessed growth, wood
   density, leaf water potential at predawn and midday, xylem embolism
   resistance (P50), and hydraulic safety margins (HSM). The leaf water
   potential ranged from -2.9 to 0 MPa. The non-pioneer species C.
   guianensis and H. courbaril exhibited the lowest P50 (-4.06 MPa),
   indicating higher embolism resistance, whereas the pioneer T. rosea had
   the highest P50 (-1.25 MPa), indicating lower resistance. The HSM varied
   from -1.60 to 3.26 MPa, with lower values in gap conditions during the
   dry period (-1.60 MPa), especially affecting pioneer species. Wood
   density was influenced by both light and species type, with non-pioneers
   showing a generally higher density, with H. courbaril reaching 0.75 g
   cm-3 in the understory while the pioneer T. rosea showed the lowest
   density (0.27 g cm-3). These results highlight that light conditions
   affect hydraulic traits differently across species strategies,
   especially during early growth. Non-pioneer, slow-growing native species
   appear more resilient to light variation, making them suitable for
   future plantations aimed at climate adaptation in secondary forests.},

Journal = {GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY},
Year = {1999},
Volume = {5},
Number = {6},
Pages = {693-702},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The future flora of Amazonia will include significant areas of secondary
   forest as degraded pastures are abandoned and secondary succession
   proceeds. The rate at which secondary forests regain carbon (C) stocks
   and re-establish biogeochemical cycles that resemble those of primary
   forests will influence the biogeochemistry of the region. Most studies
   have focused on the effects of deforestation on biogeochemical cycles.
   In this study, we present data on the recuperation of carbon stocks and
   carbon fluxes within a secondary forest of the eastern Amazon, and we
   compare these measurements to those for primary forest, degraded
   pasture, and productive pasture. Along a transect from a 23-y-old
   degraded pasture, through a 7-y-old secondary forest, through a
   16-year-old secondary forest, and to a primary forest, the delta(13)C
   values of soil organic matter (SOM) in the top 10 cm of soil were -21.0,
   -26.5, -27.4, and -27.9 parts per thousand, respectively, indicating
   that the isotopic signature of SOM from C3 forest plants was rapidly
   re-established. The degraded pasture also had significant inputs of C
   from C3 plants. Radiocarbon data indicated that most of the C in the top
   10 cm of soil had been fixed by plants during the last 30 years.
   Differences in soil C inventory among land use types were small compared
   to uncertainties in their measurement. Root inputs were nearly identical
   in primary and secondary forests, and litterfall in the secondary forest
   was 88\% of the litterfall rate of the primary forest. In contrast, the
   secondary forest had only 17\% of the above ground biomass. Because of
   rapid cycling rates of soil C and rapid recovery of C fluxes to and from
   the soil, the below ground C cycle in this secondary forest was nearly
   identical with those of the unaltered primary forest.},

Abstract = {Tree species composition and structure of a 40-year chronosequence of
   secondary forests was compared with old-growth forests in southern
   Bahia, Brazil. Twelve stands were randomly selected that represented
   three age classes: 10, 25, and 40 year old with four replications in
   each class. All stands selected had been established after abandonment
   from swidden cultivation and were surrounded by old-growth forests. In
   every stand, ten 0.01-ha transects were established and all stems (a
   parts per thousand yen5 cm diameter at breast height) were measured and
   identified. Results were compared with the dataset of two neighboring
   old-growth sites. Mean diameter, total height, and stand basal area
   increased with age. Number of trees/ha peaked in 40 year old stands. The
   results showed that secondary forests in this region take much more than
   40 years to recover the structure of old-growth forests. In contrast,
   species richness recovery was rapid with a continuous accumulation of
   species with age in secondary forests. Species richness and diversity
   increased with age as did similarity between secondary stands and
   old-growth stands. More than half of the species found in the 40 year
   old stands were shared with the neighboring old-growth forests. However,
   species richness and diversity were higher in old growth sites.},

Abstract = {In this study, we evaluated the potential of the passive restoration
   approach in recovering the original forest in a region particularly
   important for the conservation of the Atlantic forest biodiversity. This
   biome has been fragmented and reduced to only 11.7\% of its original
   range and currently its conservation relies considerably on the
   spontaneous regeneration of native forests in abandoned agricultural
   lands, a widespread phenomenon referred to in this study as passive
   restoration. We compare the regeneration strata of a 25-year-old
   secondary forest (restoration site) and of a primary forest (reference
   site) based on tree and shrub data in order to evaluate and characterize
   passive restoration in the surroundings of the Iguacu National Park, in
   western Parana State, Brazil. We recorded 589 individuals from 43
   species in the restoration site and 831 individuals from 48 species in
   the reference site. We found smaller values of density, diversity,
   proportions of individuals from zoochoric and non-pioneer species; and a
   distinct floristic composition at the restoration site. However, plant
   diameter, species richness and proportions of zoochoric and non-pioneer
   species did not differ between sites, suggesting an appropriate
   successional trajectory, and the potential for the application of the
   passive restoration approach in the region. We found a greater number of
   indicator species at the reference site and some primary forest
   specialists were not even found at the restoration site, showing the
   importance of the maintenance of primary forests in the fragmented
   landscape in order to allow passive restoration to recover original

Abstract = {High costs of tree planting are a barrier to meeting global forest
   restoration targets. Natural forest regeneration is more cost-effective
   than tree planting, but its potential to foster restoration at scale is
   poorly understood. We predict, map, and quantify natural regeneration
   potential within 75.5 M ha of deforested lands in the Brazilian Atlantic
   Forest. Of 34.1 M ha (26.4\%) of current forest cover, 2.7 M ha (8.0\%)
   regenerated naturally from 1996 to 2015. We estimate that another 2.8 M
   ha could naturally regenerate by 2035, and a further 18.8 M ha could be
   restored using assisted regeneration methods, thereby reducing
   implementation costs by US\$ 90.6 billion (77\%) compared to tree
   planting. These restored forests could sequester 2.3 GtCO(2) of carbon,
   reduce the mean number of expected species at risk of extinction by
   63.4, and reduce fragmentation by 44\% compared to current levels.

Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {143},
Number = {10},
Pages = {2328-2340},

Abstract = {Recent global assessments have shown the limited coverage of protected
   areas across tropical biotas, fuelling a growing interest in the
   potential conservation services provided by anthropogenic landscapes.
   Here we examine the geographic distribution of biological diversity in
   the Atlantic Forest of South America, synthesize the most conspicuous
   forest biodiversity responses to human disturbances, propose further
   conservation initiatives for this biota, and offer a range of general
   insights into the prospects of forest species persistence in
   human-modified tropical forest landscapes worldwide. At the biome scale,
   the most extensive pre-Columbian habitats across the Atlantic Forest
   ranged across elevations below 800 masl, which still concentrate most
   areas within the major centers of species endemism. Unfortunately, up to
   88\% of the original forest habitat has been lost, mainly across these
   low to intermediate elevations, whereas protected areas are clearly
   skewed towards high elevations above 1200 masl. At the landscape scale,
   most remaining Atlantic Forest cover is embedded within dynamic
   agro-mosaics including elements such as small forest fragments,
   early-to-late secondary forest patches and exotic tree mono-cultures. In
   this sort of aging or long-term modified landscapes, habitat
   fragmentation appears to effectively drive edge-dominated portions of
   forest fragments towards an early-successional system, greatly limiting
   the long-term persistence of forest-obligate and forest-dependent
   species. However, the extent to which forest habitats approach
   early-successional systems, thereby threatening the bulk of the Atlantic
   Forest biodiversity, depends on both past and present landscape
   configuration. Many elements of human-modified landscapes (e.g. patches
   of early-secondary forests and tree mono-cultures) may offer excellent
   conservation opportunities, but they cannot replace the conservation
   value of protected areas and hitherto unprotected large patches of
   old-growth forests. Finally, the biodiversity conservation services
   provided by anthropogenic landscapes across Atlantic Forest and other
   tropical forest regions can be significantly augmented by coupling
   biodiversity corridor initiatives with biota-scale attempts to plug
   existing gaps in the representativeness of protected areas. (C) 2010

Abstract = {This paper aims to evaluate the floristic and structure of natural
   regeneration in a forest fragment located in the south of Espirito Santo
   State, as well as to verify the interaction between vegetation and
   environmental variables. The study was developed in Private Reserve of
   Nature Patrimony (RPPN) Cafundo, with twelve sample units (1 x 20m),
   where three classes based on size - Class 1 (plants between 0.1 and 1m
   high), Class 2 (plants between 1.1 and 3m high) and Class 3 (plants
   higher than 3m and less than 5cm DBH). This RPPN has a total area of
   517ha, which approximately 358ha were used for allocation of
   experimental units. Individuals were classified according to ecological
   group and dispersion syndrome. Floristic diversity, equability, density
   and frequency of species were also calculated. Analysis of natural
   regeneration, floristic similarity between natural regeneration and the
   upper layer as well the regenerating layer interaction with
   environmental variables was performed through Canonical Correspondence
   Analysis. We found 678 individuals distributed in 73
   morphospecies/species, with Actinostemon klotzschii and Goniorrhachis
   marginate being the most abundant. Sorensen's similarity between natural
   regeneration and the adult tree layer was 29\%. The most dominant
   ecological groups were late secondary, while zoochory was the
   predominant dispersion syndrome among existing species. Shannon
   diversity index was 3.13 and equability 0.72. Goniorrhachis marginata,
   Actinostemon klotzschii and Psychotria carthagenensis species had
   correlation with carbon (C), phosphorus (P), declivity and canopy cover.
   We concluded that the natural regeneration component within studied area
   has a high richness and density of individuals when compared to studies
   developed in similar phytophysiognomies. The studied environmental
   variables seem to have little influence on the distribution of natural
   regeneration species in the RPPN, once only carbon, phosphorus,
   declivity and canopy cover have explained the species distribution
   within fragment.},

   FOREST AT AGUA LIMPA FARM (DF)},
Journal = {CERNE},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {15},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-9},

Abstract = {The Capetinga gallery forest is located at Agua Limpa Farm, in the
   Federal District, Brazil. The floristic composition and structure of the
   natural regeneration at the edges and in the interior of the gallery
   forest at the watershed of the Capetinga stream was studied to detect
   floristic and structural patterns related to the forest environments.
   Thirty (5x5m) plots were placed in each environment to sample saplings,
   individuals from 1,0m high with diameter at the steam base under 5,0cm.
   Within these plots, (2x2m) sub-plots were allocated to sample seedlings,
   individuals lower than 1,0m height. The sampled plots were distant to
   the stream batik to minimize the humidity effect. Shannon \& Wiener
   diversity index varied from 2,86 (seedlings at the edges) to 3,51
   (saplings at the interior) and it was higher in the interior for both
   categories. Sorensen's similarity index varied from 0.474 for seedlings
   (comparing edges with interior) to 0.735 (seedlings and saplings at the
   edges). Czekanowski indices were low and reflected the high
   differentiation in structure from plot to plot in the same gallery
   forest. TWINSPAN classification suggested two distinct communities for
   saplings for both conditions, formed by species accordingly to their
   requirements for light and water. No differentiation was detected for
   seedlings between the environments indicating a low response of plants
   at all early stage to the environmental conditions within the forest.
   The Capetinga gallery forest suffered disturbances by fire and the small
   variations in species composition and vegetation structure between
   environments suggests then most of the natural regeneration is tolerant

Abstract = {The role of biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) during secondary forest
   succession and in tropical pastures has been investigated and debated
   for several decades. Here we present results of a replicated
   experimental study in a degraded cattle pasture of eastern Amazonia
   using mass balance and a N-15 tracer in lined soil pit mesocosms with
   three treatments: (1) plant-free control plots, (2) pasture grass
   Brachiaria brizantha, and (3) regrowth of early successional secondary
   forest species. Accumulation of N in grass biomass slightly exceeded
   estimates of net N mineralization from the plant-free control plots but
   was within the margin of error, so inputs of BNF may not have been
   needed. In contrast, the secondary forest vegetation accumulated about 3
   times as much biomass N annually as the net N mineralization estimate,
   suggesting at least some role for BNF. Based on isotopic and mass
   measurements of N-fixing species, BNF was estimated to contribute at
   least 273\% of mean annual plant uptake in the secondary forest regrowth
   vegetation plots. Although BNF is probably important for recuperation of
   tropical secondary forests following land use change, the majority of
   the N taken up by both grasses and secondary forest regrowth arose from
   mineralization of the stocks of soil N.
   Plain Language Summary Replacing tropical forests with cattle pastures
   can alter the amount of nitrogen available to support the growth of
   pasture grasses or regrowing trees. Pastures are often abandoned when
   they are no longer productive, allowing native forests to regrow. Here
   we present the results of an experiment located in a degraded cattle
   pasture in the Brazilian Amazon Basin, where we measured the amount of
   nitrogen flowing in and out of the soil. Three soil plots were kept free
   of plants as a control; three were planted in a common pasture grass;
   and three were planted with seedlings of native shrubs and trees. Some
   of the tree species can use nitrogen from the air in a process called
   biological nitrogen fixation. A special nitrogen label was added to the
   soil to distinguish between nitrogen from soil and air. Grasses did not
   take up nitrogen from the air, but nearly one third of the nitrogen in
   the forest regrowth plants came from the air. These results demonstrate
   that nitrogen fixation can be important for the recuperation of tropical
   forests following deforestation and pasture abandonment, although the
   majority of the nitrogen taken up by both grasses and forest plants
   arose from the soil N.},

Abstract = {(Relationship between herbaceous vegetation and regeneration of woody
   species in abandoned pastures in the Atlantic Rain Forest in Southern
   Brazil) - Deforestation and conversion of forests to pasture is one of
   the most degrading activities impacting the Atlantic Rain Forest. We
   analyzed pastures abandoned for 8, 14, 48 50 and 96 months in Antonina
   (Parana state; 25 degrees 19 degrees 15 `' S; 45 degrees 24'24 `' W) to
   verify if herb cover reduces the natural regeneration of the Atlantic
   forest. We identified species and assessed shoot biomass of herbaceous
   species (in 24 1 in 2 plots), and calculated the volume of all woody
   species (height >= 1m; in 24 25 m(2) plots). We collected 59 herbaceous
   species (1,062 individuals) most of which were allochthonous species
   (95\%), including Brachiaria decumbens and B. humidicola. We also
   sampled 104 woody species (2,234 individuals). There were significant
   floristic and structural changes in the community during the first four
   years since the pasture was abandoned. Woody vegetation development was
   negatively related to herb species' biomass, Suggesting that grasses (B.
   decumbens) inhibited forest regeneration. Our results suggested that
   management, including Brachiaria slip removal, is necessary for the
   restoration of abandoned pastures in the Atlantic Forest region.},

Abstract = {In the Amazon region, small farmers use secondary forests as the only
   source of nutrients for agriculture, performing slash and burn in a
   rotation system. Secondary forests cover a large area of these
   landscapes and are crucial to maintaining soil fertility. The main
   objectives of this study were to gain insight into the seasonal
   variations in leaf area index (LAI) and root biomass growth, and to
   improve the accuracy of carbon sequestration estimates in early
   successional tropical secondary forests following shifting cultivation.
   Secondary vegetation of three different ages (1 year, 6 years and 10
   years after shifting cultivation) were monitored monthly with a LI-COR
   Plant Canopy Analyzer, and root growth was seasonally measured down to a
   depth of 400 cm using ingrowth bags. The youngest secondary forests
   showed strong LAI seasonality, and the seasonality in LAI decreased in
   the oldest forest. The roots grew throughout the year even though the
   growth rates were higher during the dry season, which supported a dense
   biomass of leaves over the year. This study clearly indicates that
   information on deep rooting and seasonality of leaf area in secondary
   tropical forests is essential for understanding ecosystem ecophysiology,
   as well as community ecology and biogeochemical cycles. (C) 2017

Abstract = {Mediterranean forest ecosystems are characterized by various vascular
   plant groups with their associated mycorrhizae and free living soil
   fungi with various ecological functions. Fire plays a major role in
   Mediterranean ecosystem dynamics and impacts both above- and
   below-ground community structure and functioning. However, studies on
   the effects induced by altered disturbance regimes (associated with
   recent land use and climate extremes) on fire ecology and especially on
   its below-ground impacts are few. The objectives of this study were to
   evaluate the effects of different wildfire regimes on soil fungal
   community structure using two different molecular methods. We
   investigated the long-term effects of wildfire on soil fungal
   communities associated with Pinus pinaster forests in central Portugal,
   by comparing the results of denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis
   (DGGE)-based profiling with those obtained with 454 pyrosequencing. Four
   forest stands with differing fire history and fire return interval, and
   vegetation cover (mature forest, early successional stage of pine
   regeneration, and forest converted to scrubland) were sampled 6 years
   after the last fire event. The pyrosequencing-based approach indicated
   ca. eight-fold higher numbers of taxa than DGGE. However, fungal
   community fingerprinting data obtained for the different study stands
   with DGGE were congruent with those obtained with pyrosequencing. Both
   short (7.6 years) and long (24 years) fire return intervals (indicated
   by the presence of ericaceous shrubs in the understorey) induced a
   decrease in the abundance ratio between basidiomycetes and ascomycetes
   and appeared to reduce the frequency of ectomycorrhizal fungal species
   and saprophytes. Wildfire significantly reduced the frequency of late
   stage successional taxa (e.g. Atheliaceae and Cantharellales) and known
   or putative saprophytes belonging to the Clavulinaceae and the
   Archaeorhizomycetaceae. Conversely, early successional fungal species
   belonging to the Thelephoraceae were favoured by both fire return
   intervals, while the abundance of Cortinarius and Hebeloma, which
   include several Cistus-specific species, increased with short wildfire
   return intervals. This last finding highlights the relationship between
   post-fire vegetation composition and cover (vegetation successional
   stage), and fungal symbionts. We hypothesise that these changes could,
   in the long term, exhaust the resilience of Mediterranean pine forest
   vegetation and associated soil fungal communities by preventing pine
   regeneration.},

Journal = {NATURE},
Year = {2007},

Pages = {995-U6},

Abstract = {Phosphorus ( P) is generally considered the most common limiting
   nutrient for productivity of mature tropical lowland forests growing on
   highly weathered soils(1-5). It is often assumed that P limitation also
   applies to young tropical forests, but nitrogen (N) losses during
   land-use change may alter the stoichiometric balance of nutrient cycling
   processes. In the Amazon basin, about 16\% of the original forest area
   has been cleared(6), and about 30 - 50\% of cleared land is estimated
   now to be in some stage of secondary forest succession following
   agricultural abandonment(7). Here we use forest age chronosequences to
   demonstrate that young successional forests growing after agricultural
   abandonment on highly weathered lowland tropical soils exhibit
   conservative N-cycling properties much like those of N-limited forests
   on younger soils in temperate latitudes. As secondary succession
   progresses, N-cycling properties recover and the dominance of a
   conservative P cycle typical of mature lowland tropical forests
   re-emerges. These successional shifts in N: P cycling ratios with forest
   age provide a mechanistic explanation for initially lower and then
   gradually increasing soil emissions of the greenhouse gas nitrous oxide
   (N2O). The patterns of N and P cycling during secondary forest
   succession, demonstrated here over decadal timescales, are similar to N-
   and P-cycling patterns during primary succession as soils age over
   thousands and millions of years, thus revealing that N availability in
   terrestrial ecosystems is ephemeral and can be disrupted by either
   natural or anthropogenic disturbances at several timescales.},

Abstract = {The structure and dynamics of approximately 64 ha of undisturbed gallery
   forest were studied over six years. Trees from 31 cm gbh (c. 10 cm dbh)
   were measured every three years from 1985. They were in 151 (10x20 m)
   permanent plots in the Gama forest in the Federal District of Brazil.
   Natural regeneration (individuals under 31 cm gbh) was measured in
   subplots (of 2x2 m, 5x5 m and 10x10 m) within the 200 m(2) plots. The
   total tree flora (gbh greater than or equal to 31 cm) consisted of 93
   species, 81 genera and 44 families in 1985. The Leguminosae, Myrtaceae
   and Rubiaceae were the families richest in number of species. Most
   individuals and species were under 45 cm diameter and 20 m high while
   the maximum diameter per species ranged from 30 to 95 cm. The density
   structure of trees and natural regeneration was similar, in which the
   densities of c. 80\% of the species represented less than 1\% of the
   total density. The periodic mean annual diameter increment for trees
   from 10 cm dbh, was c. 0.25 cm/year. Variability was high with
   coefficients of variation c. 100\% or more. The Gama community may
   maintain tree diversity and structure in undisturbed conditions.
   Regeneration of c. 80\% of the species was found in the establishing
   phase (poles); the diameter structure was typical of native forests with
   the number of individuals decreasing with increasing size classes and
   showing little change over the six years; recruitment compensated for
   the mortality of most of the abundant species. The soils in Gama gallery
   forest were dystrophic with high aluminium content. Multivariate
   analysis suggested the stream, natural gaps and edges as the main causes
   of floristic differentiation at the community level.},

Abstract = {The Atlantic Forest is one of the most biodiverse Brazilian biomes and
   has also been the most impacted by anthropogenic activities, leading to
   fragmentation of its remnants in different stages of succession.
   Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the floristic and structural
   composition of the tree and regenerating strata in three different
   Atlantic Forest remnants located in the state of Espirito Santo. All
   living tree individuals with diameter at breast height (DBH at 1.30 m)
   >= 5 cm were sampled, and phytosociological, entropy and evenness
   parameters were obtained. In the regenerating stratum, 45 sample units
   with dimensions of 5 x 5 m were established. Inclusion criteria were a
   minimum height of 50 cm and DBH< 5 cm. Phytosociological parameters,
   Shannon diversity index, Pielou's evenness, as well as structure and
   floristic composition similarities among fragments, were obtained for
   both strata. Indicator Species Analysis (ISA) was performed to identify
   indicator species, and cluster analysis was conducted among sample
   units, along with NMDS to assess the homogeneity of groups. In both the
   tree and regenerating strata, disturbed fragments (F1 and F2) exhibited
   lower species richness and diversity, with a predominance of early
   secondary species. The older stand (F3) showed a predominance of late
   successional species, indicating more advanced vegetation conditions
   compared to the other two evaluated fragments. The families Fabaceae and
   Myrtaceae were more abundant and species-rich in both strata. Regarding
   the ISA for each fragment in the studied strata, there were observed
   changes in species composition in the regenerating stratum, suggesting a
   possible future shift in stand composition. Additionally, it was
   concluded that regeneration played a significant role in indicating
   possible successional advances and forest recovery.},

Abstract = {The understanding of the succession process is a fundamental condition
   in defining strategies for the conservation and sustainable use of
   forest ecosystems. Therefore, we aimed at testing which ecological
   factors allect short-term successional changes in the upper-montane
   forests of the ``Planalto Sul Catarinense{''} Region, Brazil. We
   evaluated the influence of propagules source, soil seed bank, edaphic
   and topographic variables, nucleating elements and natural regeneration
   floristic-structural composition on demographic rates of tree-shrub
   regenerating component in three disturbed open vegetation areas at Sao
   Joaquim National Park. We inventoried the regenerative component in
   2014, 2015 and 2016, within one 20x100 m transect in each area.
   Afterwards, demographic rates were determined for each period. The
   influence of explicative variables on demographic rates of the
   regenerating component was tested through the Generalized Least Square
   (GLS) model. We found an increment in both individuals and richness over
   time. When analyzing the influence of the explanatory variables on the
   speed of the successional process, we observed that only the
   floristic-structural composition of the natural regeneration was
   determinant. We conclude that the speed of the represented succession
   is, to a large extent, a feature related to the phase of the
   successional trajectory in which the vegetation is found.},

Abstract = {The process of anthropization of the Cerrado has generated diverse
   environmental liabilities, such as a reduction in biodiversity,
   degradation of water resources, and alteration of the quality and
   quantity of water in local water bodies. Thus, the objective of this
   study was to evaluate the evolution natural regeneration processes of
   environments under anthropic influences in relation to variations in
   climatic conditions and the recovery of environmental services in
   watersheds in the Cerrado. For this purpose, the watershed in the
   Federal Institute of the Triangulo Mineiro (IFTM) Uberaba-MG Campus was
   used. The dynamics of natural regeneration were evaluated using the
   vegetation index (MOD13Q1) and gross primary production (GPP; MOD17A2),
   which were correlated with the climatic variables and waterflow in the
   watershed. The characteristics of vegetation dynamics, climatic
   variables, and flow were determined by descriptive analysis and
   deviations, and the relationship among variables was determined using
   multivariate analysis. The process of natural regeneration presented a
   positive pattern of vegetation expansion in environments under anthropic
   influence in the Cerrado, which was due to the seasons, time, and
   climatic elements, and was observed through the temporal dynamics of
   normalized difference vegetation index NDVI and GPP in the watershed.
   Natural regeneration is determined by two climatic elements rain and air
   temperature with rain driving vegetation growth, thereby directly
   influencing the dynamics of natural regeneration and the recovery of
   environmental services.},

Abstract = {This paper describes the floristic composition and structure of tree
   stratum of a woody regenerating secondary forest, the headwaters of Sao
   Pedro stream, in the rural area of Juiz de Fora, Minas Gerais, Brazil.
   The source was chosen because of its importance as water resource, as
   ecological corridor and it is located in a Permanent Preservation Area.
   In an excerpt comprising 700 meters from the east, 25 plots of 5x5m were
   allocated, and all individuals with diameter at breast height (DBH) <=
   5cm and height> 1m were sampled, totaling 983 individuals belonging to
   42 species. There was a predominance of early succession stages species.
   It was also observed a high ecological dominance, exercised primarily by
   the high density of Tibouchina granulosa (VI = 19.2\%). The value of the
   index of species diversity (Shannon H' = 2.81 nats. ind(-1)) was lower
   than the values found in forest fragments in the region. The riparian
   forest fragment is small and isolated; however, it shows considerable
   differentiation in the arrangement of species, demonstrating the
   heterogeneity of tropical forests. Even though it's a small fragment
   within a highly impacted matrix, it has significant ecological role in
   the landscape in which it appears.},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {In the last two decades an increasing number of models and techniques
   aimed at restoring natural high-diversity tropical forests is being
   developed in Brazil and abroad. However, many of these efforts did not
   show satisfactory results and a legal and normative framework was
   created to guide these actions, particularly in the state of Sao Paulo.
   The convenience of this legislation is controversial and has triggered
   intense discussion about the assumptions on which it is based and its
   efficacy. In this study, from a sampling of around 4000 individuals,
   secondary succession in ten areas with ages varying from 2 to 60 years,
   was compared with the current regulations for the restoration of highly
   diverse tropical forests. The density ranged from 2,180 individuals
   ha(-1) in an area of 11 years succession to 7,825 individuals ha-1 in an
   area with four years of fallow land. The richness sampled was directly
   proportional to the fallow time. The proportion of pioneer species was
   inversely proportional to the time of abandonment. The proportion of
   pioneers was less than the minimum of 40\% stipulated in resolution SMA
   08/2008. Most areas presented values below the stipulated by 08/2008
   Resolution that would be a minimum of 40\% for any of ecological groups
   (Pioneer and Non Pioneer). Eight of the studied areas exceeded the
   maximum limits established for these groups in the resolution. The
   analisis of the ecological succession process during the fallow of the
   shifting cultivation areas, showed that many requirements of the
   Resolution SMA 08/2008 do not conform to what occurs naturally in the
   Atlantic Forest. These requirements may bring negative outcomes to the
   effectiveness of policies and projects to restore areas of Atlantic
   forest in Sao Paulo.},

Abstract = {The aim of this study was to evaluate the natural regeneration dynamics
   of Mora paraensis in floodplain forests in three regions of the eastern
   Amazon, and specifically, to explore the relationship between the
   abundance of regenerating trees and canopy openness. Tree height and
   circumference of all individuals of height >50 cm and diameter at breast
   height (DBH) <5 cm were measured in 2012, 2013 and 2015. A matrix of
   transitions was created and the natural regeneration (RR), demographic
   and dynamic rates were calculated. Hemispherical photos were used to
   measure canopy openness. There was no difference in the density of
   regenerating trees between the three study regions (mean = 2.957 ind.
   ha(-1)). The abundance of regenerating trees was highest in 2013, when
   5614 individuals were inventoried, and as such the RR 2012-2013 was
   positive in all three regions (mean = 7.9\%). Between 2013 and 2015, the
   RR was negative and above 50\% in all regions. Canopy openness had no
   significant effect on the abundance of regenerating trees. The abundance
   of regenerating trees of M. paraensis was high in estuarine floodplain
   forests of the Amazon River, but the regeneration dynamics varied
   between years with more favourable years alternating with periods of
   high mortality and negative regeneration.},

Title = {Small mammals from the lasting fragments of Araucaria Forest in southern
   Brazil: a study about richness and diversity},
Journal = {IHERINGIA SERIE ZOOLOGIA},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {111},
Abstract = {Rodents and marsupials together, form the most rich group of mammals in
   Brazil, they are distributed in all biomes, including Atlantic Forest,
   and can be used to analyze environmental quality. The Araucaria Forest
   is a threatened formation of the Atlantic forest with few areas
   remaining intact and a huge lack of knowledge about the potential of its
   secondary forest fragments to act as habitat refuges to native fauna.
   This study evaluated the species richness and diversity of non-volant
   small mammals among five vegetation types within a protected area in an
   Araucaria Forest area from southern Brazil. The sampling was made in six
   bimonthly campaigns during a year, by pitfall and live traps. This
   effort resulted in 875 captures of 625 individuals from 16 species. The
   most common species in Pine Plantation was Oligoryzomys nigripes, in
   Natural Regeneration forest was Thaptomys nigrita and Akodon montensis
   was most often captured in the other vegetation. Although differences in
   species composition were found among the different vegetation types,
   there was no significant difference in species richness. Nevertheless,
   true diversity values were significantly lower in the Pine Plantation.
   The results demonstrated that the substitution of native for exotic
   vegetation generated a negative impact on the group diversity. More
   studies, in other Araucaria Forest areas are necessary to allow better
   understanding of the processes driving this loss of diversity in this
   biome threatened by antropic action.},

Abstract = {Riparian areas are a recurrent focus of ecological restoration due to
   their importance for the maintenance of ecosystem services. However, few
   studies have evaluated the success of active interventions in restoring
   ecosystem functions and processes. The natural regeneration is a
   successional process and its evaluation might reveal the state and the
   potential of the ecosystem resilience in forest areas undergoing
   restoration. The present study aimed to compare natural regeneration of
   a riparian area that is undergoing restoration (planting of native
   trees, 10 years ago) with a reference forest area, in Cachoeirinha, Rio
   Grande do Sul state, Brazil. We conducted a survey of trees and shrubs
   in the upper stratum (DBH >= 5 cm) and the lower stratum (> 30 cm in
   height and DBH > 5 cm) in a total of 40 plots (100 m(2) each), within
   the planting (restoration) and the remnant forest (reference). For each
   stratum and treatment (reference vs. restoration) we analyzed
   phytosociological parameters, patterns of structure and composition, and
   similarity among plots. The results showed significant differences in
   relation to structure and species composition, especially for the upper
   stratum. For the lower stratum (natural regeneration), abundance,
   height, and species richness were similar between the restoration and
   the reference areas. Species composition in regeneration remained
   distinct. However, its similarity value was higher than any other
   comparison among strata, indicating that species that were not planted
   were able to establish in the planted areas.},

Abstract = {This research aimed to identify the presence of floristic clusters in
   the mechanisms of natural regeneration and the influence of
   environmental factors on the distribution of species and plots in the
   seedling bank. The study was conducted in the National Forest of Sao
   Francisco de Paula, RS, using six conglomerates (1ha), with 16 plots (20
   x 20m) each, disregarding the surrounding 10m. Seed rain (SR) was
   sampled in 96 circular collectors (1m(2)), distributed in the center of
   each plot. The soil seed bank (SB) was collected, using iron templates
   (0.25 x 0.25 m) and 3m of each collector from CS. The seedling bank
   (SeB) was sampled in plots of 2 x 2m, located 4m from SR collectors,
   counting the number of individuals per specie, with height >= 30cm and
   diameter at breast height (DBH) < 1cm. Cluster analysis was performed by
   TWINSPAN (Two-way Indicator Species Analysis), associated with canonical
   correspondence analysis (CCA) for BP. The presence of the CS and BS
   clusters was verified by using the nonparametric test of the sum of the
   orders (Wilcoxon). Three groups were identified and CCA indicated the
   slope as the environmental variable with the greatest influence on the
   distribution of species and plots. The groups showed great relationship
   with its history of use; with the highest densities and lowest richness
   for the three mechanisms in the group related with the highest level of
   human interference. The presence of clusters indicates that the
   regenerative processes of the forest do not occur equally in the
   remaining forest; is necessary to know them to enable the planning of
   conservation and management strategies, appropriate to each species and
   the environment.},

Abstract = {Spectral reflectance factors in the visible and near-infrared spectral
   bands were measured over five years on permanent sample plots in forest
   clear-cut communities in Estonia. The spectral-temporal profiles of
   vegetation indices Greenness and Brightness were calculated from
   discrete measurements of reflectance factors. The following hypotheses
   concerning successional reflectance dynamics in boreal forest
   communities following clear-cutting and understory destruction were
   tested. 1. Changes in the Greenness seasonal profile peak value (PV)
   during secondary succession are mainly directional and related to time
   after clear-cutting rather than to environmental fluctuations. 2. The
   rate of succession, i.e., difference between seasonal PVs of consecutive
   years, declines over time. 3. The seasonal PVs of forest communities
   from different site types become more similar (converge) during
   secondary succession.
   The results show that the secondary succession of forests in reflectance
   terms is directed towards the enhancement of contrast between visible to
   near-infrared reflectance, towards obtaining maximum spectral vegetation
   index Greenness value at a given Brightness level. The PV changes during
   secondary succession were explained by the age of the communities. The
   seasonal PVs of different site type clear-cuts converge during early
   secondary succession, resulting from different speed of clear-cut
   recolonization on fertile and poor sites.},

Title = {Tree demographic strategies largely overlap across succession in

Abstract = {Secondary tropical forests play an increasingly important role in carbon
   budgets and biodiversity conservation. Understanding successional
   trajectories is therefore imperative for guiding forest restoration and
   climate change mitigation efforts. Forest succession is driven by the
   demographic strategies-combinations of growth, mortality and recruitment
   rates-of the tree species in the community. However, our understanding
   of demographic diversity in tropical tree species stems almost
   exclusively from old-growth forests. Here, we assembled demographic
   information from repeated forest inventories along chronosequences in
   two wet (Costa Rica, Panama) and two dry (Mexico) Neotropical forests to
   assess whether the ranges of demographic strategies present in a
   community shift across succession. We calculated demographic rates for
   >500 tree species while controlling for canopy status to compare
   demographic diversity (i.e., the ranges of demographic strategies) in
   early successional (0-30 years), late successional (30-120 years) and
   old-growth forests using two-dimensional hypervolumes of pairs of
   demographic rates. Ranges of demographic strategies largely overlapped
   across successional stages, and early successional stages already
   covered the full spectrum of demographic strategies found in old-growth
   forests. An exception was a group of species characterized by
   exceptionally high mortality rates that was confined to early
   successional stages in the two wet forests. The range of demographic
   strategies did not expand with succession. Our results suggest that
   studies of long-term forest monitoring plots in old-growth forests, from
   which most of our current understanding of demographic strategies of
   tropical tree species is derived, are surprisingly representative of
   demographic diversity in general, but do not replace the need for
   further studies in secondary forests.},

Abstract = {Efforts to sequester carbon through tree plantations and natural
   regeneration in the tropics may also provide an opportunity to restore
   native forest ecosystems. However, the degree to which species
   composition of native species differs between tree plantations and
   secondary forests is unknown. In this study, we conducted surveys of
   woody plants (>= 2 cm dbh) in 20 secondary forest and tree plantation
   plots (30 x 30 m) in a tropical lowland forest landscape. Sites were 8
   to 21 years old and were either abandoned cattle pastures (secondary
   forests) or monoculture tree plantations (Hieronyma alchorneoides and
   Vochysia guatemalensis) planted for carbon sequestration. We compared
   species composition, ecological traits, and diversity of woody plants in
   secondary forests and tree plantations, while accounting for distance
   from primary forest. Species composition, but not species richness, of
   the natural regeneration was significantly different in tree plantations
   and secondary forests. The abundances of understory species, short-lived
   pioneers, and bat-dispersed species were all higher in secondary forests
   than in tree plantations. Abundances of canopy species, long-lived
   pioneers, shade-tolerant species, and dispersal categories besides bats
   were not associated with forest type. We conclude that tree plantations
   can alter species composition of regeneration compared with secondary
   forests perhaps by altering composition of seed disperser assemblages or
   inhibiting early successional species.},

Abstract = {The Atlantic Forest suffered five centuries of continuous deforestation
   related to successive economic cycles, and is now reduced to 11.7 \% of
   its original cover. The Atlantic Forest Restoration Pact was launched in
   2009 and aims to restore 15 million hectares until 2050. Natural
   regeneration can play an important role in meeting this target, however
   little attention has been paid to this process and there is a gap in the
   knowledge about its driving factors at the landscape scale. We mapped
   forest cover of an Atlantic Forest municipality in Southeastern Brazil,
   in five timeslots between years 1978 and 2014, and used the weights of
   evidence method for modeling its spatial dynamics, in order to
   understand where natural regeneration is occurring and which are the
   main factors related to this phenomenon. In 36 years, forest cover
   increased 3,020 hectares (15.3 \%), related to the decreasing of both
   rural population (R-2 = 0.9794, p = 0.0013) and cropland cover (R-2 =
   0.8679, p = 0.0212). Landscape metrics shows the increment of number of
   fragments and structural connectivity among them. The main spatial
   variables influencing forest cover dynamics were topographic position,
   slope, solar radiation, soil type and distance to forest, urban areas
   and roads. Secondary forests provide ecosystem services that can turn
   into economic benefits, and natural regeneration can reduce restoration
   costs to the municipality. The cost of active restoration of the same
   area would have meant a total expense of U\$ 15.1 million (U\$ 419
   k/year). We show here that spontaneous regeneration must be accounted
   for and incorporated into the spatial planning of Atlantic Forest
   restoration.},

Title = {Functional richness mediates landscape and management effects on tree
   biomass and soil fertility during secondary forest succession},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {162},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Secondary forests can play a critical role in conserving plant
   biodiversity and sequestering carbon. However, intensive past
   management, fragmentation, and initial soil fertility can hinder forest
   recovery during secondary succession, especially in terms of tree
   species selection. In turn, tree species selection can negatively impact
   soil fertility recovery and may slow down the succession process, but
   the direct and indirect effects between these factors remain unclear. To
   assess the complex interactions among landscape, previous management,
   soil and vegetation, 27 secondary forests of varying ages, previously
   used for eucalyptus plantations, located in diverse landscape
   configurations within the Atlantic Forest biome, were examined. Key
   variables, such as planting frequency, cutting frequency, forest cover
   in the landscape, patch isolation between fragments, functional
   richness, tree aboveground biomass (AGB), soil sum of bases, soil
   organic matter, and soil phosphorus concentration were used to construct
   a structural equation model to evaluate the direct and indirect effects
   of landscape and previous management on forest development. Cutting
   frequency and patch isolation had a negative direct effect on functional
   richness. Additionally, a strong positive direct effect of functional
   diversity on aboveground biomass and soil sum of bases was found. Thus,
   cutting frequency and patch isolation had negative indirect effects on
   biomass and soil sum of bases (a proxy for soil fertility), mediated by
   functional richness. These findings underscore the significance of
   integrating plant functional diversity into restoration strategies to
   preserve ecosystem functioning and efficiently recover biodiversity,
   tree biomass, and soil fertility in secondary forests.},

Abstract = {The main goal was to understand the dynamic process of vegetation
   colonizing an area degraded by the extraction of gold. The study area
   was stratified into three environments and, in each environment,
   contiguous ten plots of 100m(2) each were allocated. For the realization
   of the dynamics, two surveys of shrub-tree with level of inclusion
   (DAS(30) > 3 cm) were carried out. The first one was realized in 2008
   and second in 2010. In 2010, the new individuals that met the criterion
   for inclusion ( recruits) were marked and measured, the dead registered
   and the survivors were measured again. The rates of mortality,
   recruitment, gain and loss in basal area of each environment were
   calculated and it became evident the importance of dynamics as a tool to
   help understand the relationships of ecological succession of species.
   The Shannon diversity index among the three environments were compared
   by t-test of Hutcheson and it was used the analysis of indicator species
   to determine species preferences of each of the three pre-determined
   environments. The total number of individuals passed of 707 to 909 in
   two years of interval, reinforcing the importance of natural
   regeneration processes of ecological succession. The environment II
   remained the most abundant one despite it presented a high mortality
   rate, which can be explained by the high rate of recruitment. The
   species Eremanthus incanus, Trembleya laniflora, Trembleya parviflora,
   Roupala montana, Coccoloba brasiliensis and Tibouchina candoleana,
   presented higher importance of value in the two surveys, showing
   superiority in the colonization of the area degraded by the extraction
   of gold and could be indicated in programs for the recuperation of
   degraded areas that are in similar conditions in the region of
   Diamantina municipality.},

Title = {Intensive silviculture enhances biomass accumulation and tree diversity
   recovery in tropical forest restoration},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {29},
Number = {2},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Maximizing initial aboveground woody biomass (AGB) accumulation in order
   to obtain early payments for carbon stocking is essential for the
   financial viability of reforestation programs fostered by climate
   mitigation efforts. Intensive silviculture, i.e., silviculture
   traditionally used in commercial forestry to maximize productivity and
   gains, has recently been advocated as a promising approach to enhance
   AGB accumulation in restoration plantations. However, this approach may
   hamper natural forest regeneration and ecological succession due to high
   competition between colonizing plants and planted trees. We investigated
   the impacts of different silvicultural treatments applied to restoration
   plantations with 20 native tree species on AGB accumulation and
   spontaneous regeneration of native woody species in an experiment set up
   in the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. Intensive silviculture demonstrated a
   remarkable potential to enhance AGB accumulation in restoration
   plantations by increasing up to three times the AGB of tree stands (from
   similar to 25 to 75 Mg/ha in the 12th year). Intensive
   fertilization/weed control enhanced AGB accumulation, while higher tree
   density and the proportion of pioneers did not have a significant effect
   on AGB over the time. In spite of higher costs (cost increase of
   13-19\%), the cost-effectiveness for AGB accumulation of intensive
   silviculture was comparable to that of traditional silviculture applied
   to restoration (US\$50-100/Mg AGB for 3 x 2 m spacing). Contrary to our
   expectations, we did not find a trade-off between AGB accumulation by
   planted trees and the spontaneous regeneration of tree species, since
   intensive silviculture enhanced the regeneration of both planted (total
   of 12 species) and colonizing woody species (total of 30 species) in the
   plantation understory. Specifically, a strong association was found
   between AGB stocks and the abundance and richness of colonizing species,
   a vast majority of which (90\% of species and 95\% of individuals) were
   dispersed by animals. We report a case of positive correlation between
   AGB stocking and woody species regeneration in the restoration of the
   Atlantic Forest. Fostering the establishment and maintenance of
   restoration tree plantations can, in some cases, be a win-win strategy
   for climate mitigation and biodiversity conservation in human-modified
   tropical landscapes.},

Title = {Forest recovery in post-pasture Amazonia: Testing a conceptual model of
   space use by insectivorous understory birds},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {194},
Pages = {22-30},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Understanding how animals move in a complex habitat mosaic is critical
   to biodiversity conservation as deforested lands and secondary
   rainforests accumulate in landscapes previously dominated by primary
   forests. To visualize the spatiotemporal dynamics of secondary forest
   recovery after pasture abandonment, we formed a conceptual model
   predicting avian space use during a temporal sequence beginning with
   deforestation and continuing through regrowth of old secondary forest.
   We tested five predictions of the model at the Biological Dynamics of
   Forest Fragments Project near Manaus, Brazil, using 73 radio-tagged
   understory insectivores of three species: two woodcreepers
   (Glyphorynchus spirurus, Xiphorhynchus pardalotus) and a terrestrial
   antthrush (Formicarius colma). Both woodcreepers provided evidence to
   support all predictions except that of greater path tortuosity in
   primary forest. Woodcreepers using secondary forest had larger home
   ranges, larger core areas, and faster movement rates than in primary
   forest Further, the proportion of all species' core areas in primary
   forest exceeded the proportion of home ranges in primary forest.
   Formicarius colma showed a fundamentally different pattern than the
   woodcreepers: it essentially avoided secondary forest until 27-31 years
   after pasture abandonment, at which point movements were
   indistinguishable from those in primary forest. Formicarius colma and
   other terrestrial insectivores show implastic spatiotemporal responses
   to recovering secondary growth, which we suspect contributes to the
   sensitivity of this guild to forest disturbance. Quantifying the value
   of marginal (and economically inconsequential) habitats such as
   secondary forest will be essential as land managers strive to maintain
   species persistence and connectivity in increasingly heterogeneous
   tropical landscapes. Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

   canjerana obtained from natural regeneration seedling survival used to
   produce bare root and stump seedlings. Survival 60 days after planting
   was evaluated through a Generalized Linear Model with logit as link
   function, controlled by seedling diameter and planting method. Bare root
   seedlings had a greater survivorship probability when its diameter was
   smaller than one centimeter. Stump seedlings with more than two
   centimeters of diameter had a survival probability greater than 80\%.
   Stump seedlings with more than two centimeters may contribute to cost
   reduction in forest environment restoration projects.},

Abstract = {Water availability is the main limiting factor to plants growth in
   tropical dry forests, influencing vegetation ecophysiological responses
   throughout ecological succession. In this study, we analyzed the water
   potential and gas exchange in two phytophysiognomies of a Brazilian
   tropical dry forest, along a chronosequence and in moments of low and
   high VPD. We selected an area of Crystalline Caatinga (CC) and Arboreal
   Caatinga (AC), and in both sites delimited three plots at different
   successional stages (initial, intermediate, and late). At each
   collection site within areas at each successional stage, we sampled the
   four most abundant species. For CC plants, water potential and gas
   exchange were similar at all successional stages, regarding VPD, and
   higher than in AC site. Trees growing in the AC site showed more plastic
   responses than those in the CC area, mainly in gas ex-change, whereas CC
   plants (mainly herbs) showed a higher variation in water potential. We
   established that this differential response occurred due to the
   structure of the plant community and soil water availability. Trees'
   leaf traits tend to present long-term responses, and we observed that
   vegetation in the AC site showed most markedly differences among
   successional stages than plants in CC site.},

   at adjacent fragment was collected. Twelve species and nine families
   were identified. The Shannon' index (H' = 0.427) and the equability (J'
   = 0.166) showed a low floristic diversity, aside from the dominance of
   Mabea fistulifera (VI = 76\%). Significant influence of the distance of
   adjacent forest on the fireaffected area and litter production was
   observed. The enrichment with species to increase the local diversity

Abstract = {Secondary forest area enlarged significantly in the recent years. Due to
   the importance that this kind of forest has taken regarding plans for
   restoration and conservation, a wider understanding of its organization

   Aiming at comparing the composition and structure of the herb-shrub

   (RFID-forest remnant and FLT-57-year old forest), as well as the
   relative influence of the topography and canopy opening on the
   organization of the community, vegetation and environmental data were
   collected on 24 contiguous plots in each site. Moran's I correlograms
   and partial Mantel tests were used to test for correlations between
   community data and environmental variables. To examine differences
   between sample areas, Student's t-tests were applied. The lianas proved
   to be spatially structured in both environments, with a trend similar to
   that observed in the average elevation. In RFID, average elevation
   distances were positively correlated with the distances of tree density
   and total richness matrices and negatively correlated with the distance
   matrix density of herbaceous plants. In FLT, significant correlations
   were observed only between the distances of the tree density matrix and
   those of maximum elevation difference and between distances of elevation
   and those of total species richness. By comparing the two areas, only
   the shrub components and to canopy opening did not presented
   differences. The structure of the herbaceous shrub component was
   associated with topographic characteristics, suggesting a strong
   influence of the flooding regime.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE},

Volume = {23},
Number = {6},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Questions What are the main features of the seed rain in a fragmented
   Atlantic forest landscape? Can seed rain species attributes (life form,
   dispersal mode, successional status) relate to the spatial arrangement
   (size and number of fragments, edge density and presence of corridor) of
   forest fragments in the landscape? How does the rain forest landscape
   structure affect the seed rain? Location Atlantic rainforest, Sao Paulo
   State, Southeastern Brazil. Methods Seed rain samples were collected
   monthly throughout 1yr, counted, identified and classified according to
   species dispersal mode, successional status and life form. Seed rain
   composition was compared with woody species near the seed traps.
   Relationships between seed rain composition and landscape spatial
   arrangement (fragment area, presence of corridor, number of fragments in
   the surroundings, proximity of fragments, and edge density) were tested
   using canonical correspondence analysis (CCA). Results We collected
   20142 seeds belonging to 115 taxa, most of them early successional and
   anemochorous trees. In general, the seed rain had a species composition
   distinct from that of the nearby forest tree community. Small isolated
   fragments contained more seeds, mainly of anemochorous, epiphytic and
   early-successional species; large fragments showed higher association
   with zoochorous and late-successional species compared to small
   fragments. The CCA significantly distinguished the species dispersal
   mode according to fragment size and isolation, anemochorous species
   being associated to small and isolated fragments, and zoochorous species
   to larger areas and fragment aggregation. Nevertheless, a gradient
   driven by proximity (PROX) and edge density (ED) segregated lianas (in
   the positive extremity), early successional and epiphyte species (in the
   negative end); large fragments were positively associated to PROX and
   ED. Conclusions The results highlight the importance of the size and
   spatial arrangement of forest patches to promote habitat connectivity
   and improve the flux of animal-dispersed seeds. Landscape structure
   controls seed fluxes and affects plant dispersal capacity, potentially
   influencing the composition and structure of forest fragments. The seed
   rain composition may be used to assess the effects of landscape spatial
   structure on plant assemblages, and provide relevant information for
   biodiversity conservation.},

   application on an abandoned pasture, central Amazonia, Brazil},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL AND EXPERIMENTAL BOTANY},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {64},
Number = {2},

Abstract = {This research represents one of the first studies in Amazonia to examine
   soil moisture and water-use efficiency (WUE) in secondary forest (SF)
   vegetation regrowing on abandoned pastures subjected to reduced nutrient
   constraints via a nutrient addition experiment. Extensive forested areas
   (about 80\% of deforestation) have been converted to pastures in
   Amazonia, which were later abandoned following soil degradation and
   reduction in grass productivity. Colonization of these areas proceeds
   through species adapted to adverse edaphic conditions, such as low soil
   nutrients. Yet there is little data from such environments showing the
   interaction of soil nutrients and water availability on plant
   physiological processes. The objective of this study was to test whether
   three common SF tree species have positive physiological responses, e.g.
   increased photosynthesis and water-use efficiency, when nutrient
   limitations are relaxed through fertilization. The experiment was
   conducted on an abandoned pasture in central Amazonia with 6-year-old
   secondary vegetation following the application of four treatments:
   control; +phosphorus (P); +phosphorus and lime (P + Ca); and
   +phosphorus, lime and gypsum (P + Ca + G). The control had higher mean
   soil moisture at 140 and 180cm depth at the end of the dry season,
   indicating that the treatment plots responded positively to fertilizer
   additions by taking up additional water. Trees of Vismia japurensis and
   Bellucia grossularloides growing on the fertilized plots had the highest
   net photosynthesis rates (A) (18.7 and 20.4 mu mol m(-2) s(-1),
   respectively). The three species utilized different strategies with
   regard to physiological and nutritional response, with V japurensis,
   regardless of treatment, using these limiting resources most efficiently
   to colonize abandoned pastures. Trees growing on the P + Ca but not +P
   alone plots increased A rates, indicating that Ca is an important
   limiting nutrient in post-pasture secondary succession. The addition of
   Ca as ash by burning primary and secondary vegetation could explain the
   rapid growth and dominance of V japurensis in abandoned pasture areas in
   central Amazonia. The efficiency of Vismia to use limiting resources
   could lead to a restructuring of SF and altered rates of stand-level
   productivity. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

   were carried out in 41 permanent parcels distributed in three Annual
   Production Units (APU), named APU B, C and D, logged in 1996, 1997 and
   1998, respectively. In all units, forest inventories were carried out
   before logging and in the years 2001 and 2014; for APU B there was an
   additional inventory in 1998. The sample included trees with diameter at
   breast height between 5 cm and 14.9 cm. The species diversity analysis
   was performed by Shannon (H') and Pielou (J) indexes and the similarity
   analysis by Jaccard index and cluster analysis. The analyzes were made
   for all grouped species and commercial species group. A total of 8,090
   trees families were sampled, distributed in 244 species and 48 families.
   Shannon index ranged from 3.77 to 4.08; Pielou index ranged from 0.74 to
   0.84. There was a significant difference between H' for all species in
   two APUs 16 and 18 years after logging. There was significant difference
   between H' for commercial species before and 16 and 18 years after
   logging. Jaccard indexes ranged from 66.7\% to 100\%. The largest
   differences for the species composition were observed between
   pre-exploration inventories and the last measurement. Diversity and
   composition of species in the natural regeneration in the logged forest
   changed in a period by 16, 17 and 18 years after logging.},

Abstract = {Secondary succession is well-understood, to the point of being
   predictable for plant communities, but the successional changes in
   plant-herbivore interactions remains poorly explored. This is
   particularly true for tropical forests despite the increasing importance
   of early successional stages in tropical landscapes. Deriving
   expectations from successional theory, we examine properties of
   plant-herbivore interaction networks while accounting for host
   phylogenetic structure along a succession chronosequence in montane
   rainforest in Papua New Guinea. We present one of the most comprehensive
   successional investigations of interaction networks, equating to > 40
   person years of field sampling, and one of the few focused on montane
   tropical forests. We use a series of nine 0.2 ha forest plots across
   young secondary, mature secondary and primary montane forest, sampled
   almost completely for woody plants and larval leaf chewers (Lepidoptera)
   using forest felling. These networks comprised of 12 357 plant-herbivore
   interactions and were analysed using quantitative network metrics, a
   phylogenetically controlled host-use index and a qualitative network
   beta diversity measure. Network structural changes were low and
   specialisation metrics surprisingly similar throughout succession,
   despite high network beta diversity. Herbivore abundance was greatest in
   the earliest stages, and hosts here had more species-rich herbivore
   assemblages, presumably reflecting higher palatability due to lower
   defensive investment. All herbivore communities were highly specialised,
   using a phylogenetically narrow set of hosts, while host phylogenetic
   diversity itself decreased throughout the chronosequence. Relatively
   high phylogenetic diversity, and thus high diversity of plant defenses,
   in early succession forest may result in herbivores feeding on fewer
   hosts than expected. Successional theory, derived primarily from
   temperate systems, is limited in predicting tropical host-herbivore
   interactions. All succession stages harbour diverse and unique
   interaction networks, which together with largely similar network
   structures and consistent host use patterns, suggests general rules of
   assembly may apply to these systems.},

Title = {Cutting of dry forests in a semiarid region of northeastern Brazil},
Journal = {REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE},
Year = {2024},

Abstract = {Dry forests are one of the most threatened ecosystems in the world, and
   they are poorly protected. The semiarid region of northeastern Brazil is
   the largest area in the New World with a predominance of dry forests,
   although it has been estimated that half of Brazil's original semiarid
   vegetation has already been removed. This study assesses the extent of
   changes in areas covered by native dry forests (Caatinga) over a period
   of 46 years (1973-2019) in the southern portion of the semiarid region
   in Brazil's State of Bahia. The study area encompasses 18 municipalities
   (counties) with a total area 2,344,733 ha. To map changes in vegetation
   cover, Landsat satellite images were used for the years 1973, 1987,
   2001, and 2019. The area with native vegetation was reduced by 614,100
   ha between 1973 and 2019. The area with vegetation declined in all
   municipalities; however, the intensity of changes in land use varied
   among the analyzed periods, with 77.1\% of the reduction in vegetation
   cover occurring between 1973 and 1987. In the 1990s, the intensity of
   cutting of native vegetation decreased, mainly due to a decrease in the
   area planted to cotton, while natural regeneration increased. Cutting
   native vegetation resumed in the 2000s while regeneration declined. In
   2019, the remaining vegetation was almost completely restricted to hills
   or mountains and was in fragments composed of a mosaic of vegetation in
   different stages of regeneration. Areas that still have native
   vegetation must be preserved, including those that are regenerating from
   past clearing.},

Abstract = {Secondary forests are increasingly dominant in human-modified tropical
   landscapes, but the drivers of forest recovery remain poorly understood.
   Soil conditions influence plant community composition, and are expected
   to change over a gradient of succession. However, the role of soil
   conditions as an environmental filter driving community assembly during
   forest succession has rarely been explicitly assessed. We evaluated the
   role of stand basal area and soil conditions on community assembly and
   its consequences for community functional properties along a
   chronosequence of Atlantic forest regeneration following sugar cane
   cultivation. Specifically, we tested whether community functional
   properties are related to stand basal area, soil fertility and soil
   moisture. Our expectations were that edaphic environmental filters play
   an increasingly important role along secondary succession by increasing
   functional trait convergence towards more conservative attributes. We
   sampled soil and woody vegetation features across 15 second-growth
   (3-30years) and 11 old-growth forest plots (300m(2) each). We recorded
   tree functional traits related to resource-use strategies (specific leaf
   area, SLA; leaf dry matter content, LDMC; leaf area, LA; leaf thickness,
   LT; and leaf succulence, LS) and calculated community functional
   properties using the community-weighted mean (CWM) of each trait and the
   functional dispersion (FDis) of each trait separately and all traits
   together. With exception of LA, all leaf traits were strongly associated
   with stand basal area; LDMC and SLA increased, while LT and LS decreased
   with forest development. Such changes in LDMC, LT and LS were also
   related to the decrease in soil nutrient availability and pH along
   succession, while soil moisture was weakly related to community
   functional properties. Considering all traits, as well as leaf thickness
   and succulence separately, FDis strongly decreased with increasing basal
   area and decreasing soil fertility along forest succession, presenting
   the lowest values in old-growth forests.Synthesis. Our findings suggest
   that tropical forest regeneration may be a deterministic process shaped
   by soil conditions. Soil fertility operates as a key filter causing
   functional convergence towards more conservative resource-use
   strategies, such as leaves with higher leaf dry matter content.},

Abstract = {Enrichment plantings into secondary forest are an important option in
   restoring species diversity and ecosystem services. However, little
   attention has been given to environmental requirements for species
   performance. This study evaluated the effects of lightgaps and
   topographic position on the growth and survival of four native tree
   species (Pouteria caimito, Garcinia macrophylla, Dipteryx odorata and
   Cynometra bauhiniaefolia) planted into a 26-year old secondary forest
   originating from abandoned pastures in the central Amazon Basin.
   Artificial lightgaps and control plots under closed canopy were
   uniformly distributed on plateaus and bottomlands near water bodies.
   Seedlings were planted randomly into the plots and monitored for 28
   months. Seedling survival rate was high (93\%) and did not differ among
   species. Overall, lightgaps produced a 38\% increase in seedling height
   relative to the controls. Although the four species naturally occur in
   mature forest, two of the four grew significantly more in lightgaps than
   in dosed canopy secondary forest. Overall, bottomlands facilitated
   greater seedling growth in height (38\%) relative to plateaus, but only
   one species exhibited a significant increase. This study shows the
   importance of the environmental variability generated with canopy
   openings along the topographic gradient, suggesting that both the
   selection of species and microsite conditions of planting sites have to
   be considered important criteria in the recovery of degraded areas.},

Abstract = {Eucalyptus species are cultivated for various purposes around the world,
   mainly because they adapt well and grow quickly. These productive
   matrices of planted forests are common in Brazil, added to which, areas
   of native vegetation are requirements of environmental legislation.
   Although eucalyptus plantations are widely distributed in Brazil, little
   is known about the soil seed bank (SSB) in the eucalyptus productive
   matrix (EPM). We aim to understand how the EPM made up of eucalyptus
   plantations and native forest remnants affect the SSB in the Brazilian
   Pampa. Samples of the SSB of EPM were collected and monitored for 6
   months in a shade house. We evaluated seedling emergence, richness,
   composition, ecological characteristics of the species, diversity, and
   floristic similarity. We recorded a high rate of seedling emergence,
   species richness, and different life forms and native species in all EPM
   treatments; however, the similarity between native remnants and
   eucalyptus plantations was low. The size and level of conservation of
   native remnants and the position and management of eucalyptus sites in
   the EPM influenced the diversity and composition of species. Eucalyptus
   plantations contain SSBs with potential for natural regeneration when
   they are in a landscape that maintains conserved native forest remnants.
   These results expand the knowledge of the SSB in EPM and can support
   actions in ecological restoration projects.},

Journal = {REVISTA DE BIOLOGIA TROPICAL},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {63},
Number = {2},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The conditions for plant establishment in mature forest are different
   from those found in disturbed areas. In dry environments, the herbaceous
   cover is the most important in the recolonization of deforested areas.
   It can, therefore, act as an ideal biological group for assessing how
   changes in habitat heterogeneity affect the resilience of dry forests.
   The aim of this research was to evaluate whether natural regeneration of
   the herbaceous stratum differed between areas of mature and secondary
   forest of Caatinga and to describe this process. The study took place in
   the Brazilian semiarid region during the rainy season 2011 (January to
   August), where fifty 1m(2) plots were set up, 25 allocated to the
   microhabitat established as ``between canopies{''} and 25 to the
   microhabitat ``under the canopy{''}. The herbaceous species selected for
   the study were Delilia biflora (Asteraceae), Gomphrena vaga
   (Amaranthaceae) and Pseudabutilon spicatum (Malvaceae), abundant species
   occurring in both areas. All individuals from the selected populations
   were counted, marked with sequential numbers, and the height of the stem
   was measured. Differences between areas, and in size and survival
   between microhabitats, were found only for the first two species. Fruit
   production was higher in the mature forest for the three species. The
   study concluded that: 1. The effect of the microhabitats ``between
   canopies{''} and ``under the canopy{''} in mature and secondary forest
   areas depends on the species considered; 2. Populations sensitive to
   light intensity differ in number of individuals, height and fruit
   production; and 3. The resilience of anthropogenic areas in semiarid
   environments can be characterized by the presence of spatial
   heterogeneity with regard to the emergence and survival of herbaceous
   seedlings, suggesting that the regeneration of disturbed areas may occur
   in patches.},

Abstract = {During forest succession, changes in tree species composition and
   individual turnover may be affected by deterministic and stochastic
   processes. In this study, we used both population and community
   approaches to assess the relative effects of deterministic and
   stochastic processes along the secondary succession of a tropical
   forest. We aimed to identify the mechanisms of community assemblage
   based on an analysis of abiotic and biotic drivers of demography. We
   assessed the demography (recruitment and survival rates) of trees
   occurring in an edaphic-successional gradient (forests aged 7-17, 20-30,
   30-55, and > 80 years; two soil types) of a regenerating forest in
   Southern Brazil. We first tested for stochasticity by building null
   models (randomized species composition and abundance) for each forest
   age interval. The composition and abundance of plants in all communities
   were different from those expected by the null models, which indicated
   determinism at the studied scale. We then used the structural equation
   models to assess the importance of environmental drivers (such as soil
   type and forest age) and species interactions (such as basal area,
   individual density and function, and phylogenetic diversity) to predict
   recruitment and survival. We found that both abiotic and biotic drivers
   affected the community assembly in successional gradients. Environmental
   drivers (soil stress and limitations related to forest structural
   complexity) indirectly affected recruitment and survival via biotic
   drivers (competitive ability, facilitation and niche complementarity).
   Therefore, the community assembly during succession is the result of a
   multi-factor process acting on recruitment and survival rates, which
   ultimately affect individual and species turnover.},

Abstract = {This study aimed to analyze the structure of natural regeneration of
   economically important woody species of Caatinga in the municipality of
   Floresta-PE, assisting with information for sustainable forest
   management of the forest physiognomy. The forest inventory was conducted
   in an area of about 50 ha of savanna vegetation (8 degrees 30'37 `' S
   and 37 degrees 59'07 `' W), municipality of Floresta-PE. With 40
   sampling units of 5 x 5 m, were measured the subjects into four classes:
   class 1 = 20 - 50 cm, class 2 = 51 - 100 cm, class 3 = 101-150 cm, class
   4 = greater than 151 cm and less than 6 cm in circumference of the base
   height. In only 37 plots had individuals in the level of inclusion and
   were identified 15 species belonging to seven botanical families,
   especially Euphorbiaceae, Fabaceae and Anacardiaceae. The diversity of
   Shannon-Weaver index (H') was 1.91 nats.ind.-1, the uniformity of Pielou
   index (E) equals 0.71. The area presented estimated density of 2,080
   ind. ha(-1). The spatial distribution showed that the characteristics of
   most species occur in group or with a tendency to grouping. The species
   Bauhinia cheilanta and Poincianella bracteosa showed higher density
   values and were present in all classes of natural regeneration,
   providing evidence that they have potential to establish themselves on
   the area and possibly will be the dominant species after reaching
   adulthood.},

Abstract = {Carbon stocks in vegetation replacing forest in Brazilian Amazonia
   affect net emissions of greenhouse gases from land-use change. A Markov
   matrix of annual transition probabilities was constructed to estimate
   landscape composition in 1990 and to project future changes, assuming
   behavior of farmers and ranchers remains unchanged. The estimated 1990
   landscape was 5.4\% farmland, 44.8\% productive pasture, 2.2\% degraded
   pasture, 2.1\% `young' (1970 or later) secondary forest derived from
   agriculture, 28.1\% `young' secondary forest derived from pasture, and
   17.4\% `old' (pre-1970) secondary forest. The landscape would eventually
   approach an equilibrium of 4.0\% farmland, 43.8\% productive pasture,
   5.2\% degraded pasture, 2.0\% secondary forest derived from agriculture,
   and 44.9\% secondary forest derived from pasture. An insignificant
   amount is regenerated `forest' (defined as secondary forest over 100
   years old). Average total biomass (dry matter, including below-ground
   and dead components) was 43.5 t ha(-1) in 1990 in the 410 X 10(3) km(2)
   deforested by that year for uses other than hydroelectric dams. At
   equilibrium, average biomass would be 28.5 t ha(-1) over all deforested
   areas (excluding dams). These biomass values are more than double those
   forming the basis of deforestation emission estimates currently used by
   the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Although higher
   replacement landscape biomass decreases net emissions from
   deforestation, these estimates still imply large net releases.},

Abstract = {The diversity of environments found in natural forests can influence the

   of this study was to evaluate the natural regeneration of arboreal
   species in different communities (floristic groups) of a mixed

   where individuals with 3.0cm <= circumference at breast height (CBH) <
   30.0cm were measured. The individuals with CBH < 3.0cm and height >=
   50cm in subunits of 3.16m x 3.16m were measured. The species with the
   greatest potential for natural regeneration in the evaluated communities
   were Sebastiania brasiliensis and Stillingia oppositifolia (Group 1),
   Myrceugenia cucullata and Allophylus guaraniticus (Group 2) and
   Stillingia oppositifolia and Myrceugenia miersiana (Group 3). The
   species Allophylus edulis, Blepharocalyx salicifolius, Justicia sp.,
   Myrceugenia cucullata and Stillingia oppositifolia were among the top 10
   species in all three communities, showing a high potential for
   regeneration. The three communities have facilitated the occurrence of
   high species richness (Group 1=101; Group 2=98; Group 3=101). However,
   early secondary and late secondary species showed greater adaptation to
   different forest sites with higher density compared to pioneer species.},

Title = {Early ecological outcomes of natural regeneration and tree plantations

Abstract = {Mixed tree plantings and natural regeneration are the main restoration
   approaches for recovering tropical forests worldwide. Despite
   substantial differences in implementation costs between these methods,
   little is known regarding how they differ in terms of ecological
   outcomes, which is key information for guiding decision making and
   cost-effective restoration planning. Here, we compared the early
   ecological outcomes of natural regeneration and tree plantations for
   restoring the Brazilian Atlantic Forest in agricultural landscapes. We
   assessed and compared vegetation structure and composition in young
   (7-20yr old) mixed tree plantings (PL), second-growth tropical forests
   established on former pastures (SGp), on former Eucalyptus spp.
   plantations (SGe), and in old-growth reference forests (Ref). We sampled
   trees with diameter at breast height (DBH) 1-5cm (saplings) and trees at
   DBH > 5cm (trees) in a total of 32 20x45m plots established in these
   landscapes. Overall, the ecological outcomes of natural regeneration and
   restoration plantations were markedly different. SGe forests showed
   higher abundance of large (DBH>20cm) nonnative species, of which 98\%
   were resprouting Eucalyptus trees, than SGp and PL, and higher total
   aboveground biomass; however, aboveground biomass of native species was
   higher in PL than in SGe. PL forests had lower abundance of native
   saplings and lianas than both naturally established second-growth
   forests, and lower proportion of animal dispersed saplings than SGe,
   probably due to higher isolation from native forest remnants. Rarefied
   species richness of trees was lower in SGp, intermediate in SGe and Ref
   and higher in PL, whereas rarefied species richness of saplings was
   higher in SG than in Ref. Species composition differed considerably
   among regeneration types. Although these forests are inevitably bound to
   specific landscape contexts and may present varying outcomes as they
   develop through longer time frames, the ecological particularities of
   forests established through different restoration approaches indicate
   that naturally established forests may not show similar outcomes to
   mixed tree plantings. The results of this study underscore the
   importance that restoration decisions need to be based on more robust
   expectations of outcomes that allow for a better analysis of the
   cost-effectiveness of different restoration approaches before scaling-up
   forest restoration in the tropics.},

Volume = {47},

Abstract = {Primary tropical rain forests are being rapidly perforated with new
   edges via roads, logging, and pastures, and vast areas of secondary
   forest accumulate following abandonment of agricultural lands. To
   determine how insectivorous Amazonian understory birds respond to edges
   between primary rain forest and three age classes of secondary forest,
   we radio-tracked two woodcreepers (Glyphorynchus spirurus, N=17;
   Xiphorhynchus pardalotus, N=18) and a terrestrial antthrush (Formicarius
   colma, N=19). We modeled species-specific response to distance to forest
   edge (a continuous variable) based on observations at varying distances
   from the primary-secondary forest interface. All species avoided
   8-14-yr-old secondary forest. Glyphorynchus spirurus and F.colma mostly
   remained within primary forest <100m from the young edge. Young F.colma
   rarely penetrated >100m into secondary forest 27-31yr old. Young
   Formicarius colma and most G.spirurus showed a unimodal response to
   8-14-yr-old secondary forest, with relative activity concentrated just
   inside primary forest. After land abandonment, G.spirurus was the first
   to recover to the point where there was no detectable edge response
   (after 11-14yr), whereas X.pardalotus was intermediate (15-20yr), and F.
   colma last (28-30yr +). Given the relatively quick recovery by our
   woodcreeper species, new legislation on protection of secondary forests
   >20-yr old in Brazil's Para state may represent a new opportunity for
   conservation and management; however, secondary forest must mature to at
   least 30yr before the full compliment of rain forest-dependent species
   can use secondary forest without adverse edge effects.},

Abstract = {1. Achieving global targets for forest restoration will require
   cost-effective strategies to return agricultural land to forest, while
   minimizing implementation costs and negative outcomes for agricultural
   production.
   2. We present a landscape approach for optimizing the cost-effectiveness
   of large-scale forest restoration. Across three different landscapes
   within Brazil's Atlantic Forest biodiversity hotspot, we modelled
   landscape scenarios based on spatially explicit data on the probability
   of natural regeneration, restoration costs, land opportunity costs, and
   forest restoration outcomes for increasing carbon stocking and landscape
   connectivity. We compare benefits of our cost-reduction approach to the
   legally mandated riparian restoration and randomly distributed
   approaches.
   3. Compared with riparian prioritization and considering both
   implementation and opportunity costs, our cost-reduction scenario
   produced the greatest savings (20.9\%) in mechanized agricultural
   landscapes.
   4. When only considering implementation costs, our cost-reduction
   scenario led to the highest savings (38.4\%) in the landscape with
   highest forest cover where natural regeneration potential is highest and
   enables cost-effective carbon stocking and connectivity.
   5. Synthesis and applications. We present a guide for forest restoration
   planning that maximizes specific outcomes with minimal costs and
   reduction of agricultural production. Furthermore, we show how policies
   could encourage prioritization of low-cost restoration via natural
   regeneration, increasing cost-effectiveness. While our study focuses on
   Brazil's Atlantic Forest, the approach can be parameterized for other
   regions.},

Abstract = {Natural regeneration offers a cheaper alternative to active
   reforestation and has the potential to become the predominant way of
   restoring degraded tropical landscapes at large-scale. We conducted a
   meta-analysis for tropical regions and quantified the relationships
   between both ecological and socioeconomic factors and biodiversity
   responses in naturally regenerating areas. Biogeographic realms, past
   disturbance, and the human development index (HDI) were used as
   explanatory variables for biodiversity responses. In addition, we
   present a case study of large-scale natural regeneration in the
   Brazilian Atlantic Forest and identify areas where different forms of
   restoration would be most suitable. Using our dataset for tropical
   regions, we showed that natural regeneration was predominantly reported
   within: the Neotropical realm; areas that were intensively disturbed;
   and countries with medium HDI. We also found that biodiversity in
   regenerating forests was more similar to the values found in old growth
   forests in: countries with either low, high, or very high HDI; less
   biodiverse realms; and areas of less intensive past disturbance. Our
   case study from Brazil showed that the level of forest gain resulting
   from environmental legislation, in particular the Brazilian Forest Code,
   has been reduced, but remains substantial. Complementary market
   incentives and financial mechanisms to promote large-scale natural
   regeneration in human-modified agricultural landscapes are also needed.
   Our analysis provides insights into the factors that promote or limit
   the recovery of biodiversity in naturally regenerating areas, and aids
   to identify areas with higher potential for natural regeneration.

Abstract = {The termites allocate the space and alimentary resources of their
   habitats with different species or groups of species. As termites are
   primary consumers, promote the mineralization of nutrients rich in
   cellulose. The objective of this work was to compare the functional
   composition of termite species among areas of abandoned pasture and of
   secondary succession adjacent to the Semideciduous Forest remnants in
   the Parque Estadual Altamiro de Moura Pacheco, state of Goias, Brazil.
   The study area comprised one abandoned pasture, one area in transition
   from abandoned pasture to forest and one fragment of Semideciduous
   Forest. The richness of termite species decreased from forest (13) to
   transition area (9) and to pasture (8). Species that nest and consume
   humus in the soil were the most common. The termite assemblage of the
   semideciduous forest remnant presented nesting and trophic habits more
   diversified than the abandoned pasture and the transition area. Among
   the 19 species sampled, 12 were recorded in only one area of study. This
   is the first occurrence of Incisitermes sp. in the ``Cerrado{''} biome
   and was recorded in the transition area. We concluded that when a
   pasture is no longer used for cattle, begins a process of succession
   that can restore the community of species of termite.},

   0.50 m) were measured to the 5, 13 and 18 months after the area had been
   systematized and abandoned. Floristic and structural alterations
   occurred in space and time. The number of individuals, species, families
   and diversity increased during the time interval studied and decreased
   with distance from the remnant fragment. These floristic and structural
   alterations in the community as a whole and in the populations of the
   most important species, Trema micrantha (L.) Blume and Schizolobium
   amazonicum Huber ex Ducke, showed the tendency of a succession model by
   facilitation, where these pioneers would be improving the ecological
   conditions and thus easing the regeneration of late species. The
   conservation of the forest fragment in the surroundings was essential
   for the natural regeneration process of the forest in the degraded area.

Abstract = {The phytosociology of the woody stratum of both young regenerating
   individuals and seed banks are quality indicators of heterogeneous
   reforestations. The objetive of this research was to evaluate the
   structure of regeneration of the arboreal species in two natural
   remainders, in three areas reforested with native species and in a
   Eucalyptus robusta settlement located in a floodplain of Mogi-Guacu
   river in Luiz Antonio County (21 degrees 31 `S and 47 degrees 55 `W),
   Sao Paulo, Brazil. Sampling was collected in 40 subplots of 2 m(2) in of
   each natural remainder and each eucalyptus sub-forest, as well as 60
   subplots of 3.5 m(2) in each area reforested. All individuals with
   height 3 10 cm and diameter at breast height (DBH) < 5.0 cm were
   measured and analyzed separately in four height classes according to
   floristic diversity, similarity, density, frequency, dominance,
   importance value and natural regeneration. A total of 2,010 individuals
   were identified, belonging to 24 families, 46 genera and 51 species. The
   species with greater importance values were Cabralea canjerana, Psidium
   cattleyanum, Nectandra megapotamica, Acacia polyphylla and Syzygium
   cumini, well represented in the four height classes. Reforestation with
   native species in a degraded Mogi-Guacu River floodplain promoted
   natural regeneration with more biodiversity than in natural remainders
   submitted to border effect, and contributed to the forest ecosystem
   restoration process. The 20-year-old Eucalyptus robusta plantation
   promoted the regeneration of climax and secondary species.},

Abstract = {The objective was to evaluate the physical properties of the soil in
   forest areas in secondary succession and in the process of passive
   restoration. The areas belong to the State University of the Midwest of
   Parana, Guarapuava, Brazil. The experimental design was completely
   randomized, with samples at six points in each area, at depths of 0 -
   0.1 m, 0.1 - 0.2 m and 0.2 - 0.3 m. The forest in secondary succession
   had a greater amount of organic matter, this property acts directly on
   the other evaluated variables. The area under passive restoration had
   higher values for soil density, lower total porosity at the three depths
   and greater resistance to soil penetration, and these results are
   related to the history of area use. The microporosity did not differ
   between the studied areas and the macroporosity presented smaller values
   with only difference in the layer of 0.2 - 0.3 m, due to the presence of
   roots and decomposition of the litter. The highest value of maximum
   density was in the area under passive restoration (1.23 Mg m(-3)), with
   humidity of 0.32 Mg Mg-1, already in the area of forest in secondary
   succession this value was 1.12 Mg m(-3) and humidity of 0.45 Mg Mg-1,
   depending on the amount of organic matter that directly influences the
   reduction of the density. Soil recovery in degraded areas is a slow
   process, and even after ten years, it was not possible to restore the
   ideal physical properties in the forest under passive restoration.},

Abstract = {International forest landscape restoration commitments have promoted the
   restoration of millions of hectares of degraded and deforested lands
   globally, but few forest restoration approaches provide both
   ecologically-sound and financially-viable solutions for achieving the
   spatial scale proposed. One potential revenue source for restoration is
   selective harvesting of timber, a product for which there is a clear
   global market and increasing demand. The use of commercially valuable
   exotic trees may attract farmers to restoration, but can be a major
   concern for ecologists. Here, we present results collected over 7 years
   from experimental studies at three sites across the Brazilian Atlantic
   Forest to assess the impacts of incorporating exotic eucalypts as a
   transitional stage in tropical forest restoration on above-ground
   biomass accumulation, native woody species regeneration and financial
   viability. Biomass accumulation was nine times greater in mixed
   eucalypt-native species plantations than native only plantings due to
   fast eucalypt growth. Nonetheless, the growth of native non-pioneer
   trees was not affected or only slightly reduced by eucalypts prior to
   logging. Eucalypts did not negatively affect the natural regeneration of
   native woody species before or after eucalypt logging. Canopy cover
   regrew quickly but was slightly lower a year following logging in mixed
   eucalypt-native species plantations. Natural regeneration richness and
   planted non-pioneer growth were similar across treatments in the
   post-logging period. We found higher variation of biomass accumulation
   and native species regeneration among sites than between plantation
   types within sites. The income from eucalypt wood production offset
   44\%-75\% of restoration implementation costs. Synthesis and
   applications. Many of the negative effects attributed to eucalypts on
   the growth and natural regeneration of native trees depend on features
   of the production system, landscape structure, soil, and climate in
   which they are grown, rather than the effects of eucalypts per se. In
   Brazil's Atlantic Forest region, exotic eucalypts can become important
   allies of tropical forest restoration, and their use and investment
   opportunities should be considered within the portfolio of options
   supported by public and private funding and policies.},

Abstract = {Key message Exotic tree species Syzygium cumini and Taliparti tiliaceum
   affect restinga forest regeneration growing under them, in comparison to
   native species, mainly because they reduce saplings'
   abundance.Biological plant invasions are a considerable threat to native
   vegetation biodiversity, mainly when the invaded site consists in
   suppressed fragmented remnants surrounded by urbanization. Although this
   is the case of Brazilian restinga forests, knowledge on potential
   invasion events in these environments remains scarce. We herein
   identified differences between these communities by comparing natural
   regeneration on plots planted with exotic tree species Syzygium cumini
   and Talipariti tiliaceum to those planted with native trees on an urban
   restinga forest park in Rio de Janeiro city. We observed that natural
   regeneration communities were impacted by exotic trees, resulting in
   alterations to both their structure and floristic composition.
   Furthermore, the magnitude of this impact depended on the identity of
   the exotic tree in question. Somehow, plant community regeneration based
   on species T. tiliaceum was significantly different from that in native
   plots, at all parameters: species richness, mean abundance of
   individuals, mean plant height, total basal area, absolute density and
   abundance of seedlings. S. cumini, in its turn, seemed to have only
   significantly changed regeneration's abundance parameters. Therefore,
   based on our findings, S. cumini and T. tiliaceum presented potential
   invasive impact to native flora. These species should be monitored and
   likely managed in other restinga forests, since prevention is the key
   action to preserve our native environments from biological invasions.},

Abstract = {The ecological resilience of abandoned pastures has important
   implications for the potential of passive restoration in the Brazilian
   Atlantic Forest, especially in the face of the ambitious restoration
   targets for this biodiversity hotspot. In the present study, we aimed to
   investigate the influence of past land-use on natural regeneration in
   two secondary forests that established on abandoned pastures with
   different land use histories (Abandoned + Fire-15 years since the last
   fire event and Abandoned-36 years ago) in a lowland Brazilian Atlantic
   Forest. Both secondary forests exhibit low resilience for the three
   analyzed attributes: vegetation structure, richness, and species
   composition. Secondary forests affected by fire have the lowest values
   for species richness, aboveground biomass and leaf area index compared
   to old-growth forests. Secondary forests were dominated by Moquiniastrum
   polymorphum-Asteraceae, which was absent from the old-growth forests.
   Fire resistance, capacity to establish in nutrient-poor soils and
   efficient seed dispersal in human-modified landscapes are important
   attributes that may explain the dominance of this species. We
   demonstrate that even in sites considered appropriate for passive
   restoration a priori (e.g. located in a protected area, 36 years since
   abandonment and close to old-growth forests), secondary forests
   exhibited low aboveground biomass and communities were dominated by few
   species. Therefore, our results highlight the effects of past land-use
   on natural regeneration and suggest the necessity to use interventions
   such as enrichment plantings, nucleation techniques and assisted natural
   regeneration in order to accelerate forest restoration.},

Abstract = {In this work it was hypothesized that secondary succession on sites that
   have been managed by single planting of mangrove species is compromised
   by residual stressors, which could reduce the ecosystem's structural
   development and lower its functions. Forest structure and environmental
   characteristics of three planted mangrove stands are compared with
   reference sites. Structural attributes showed significant differences in
   the comparison of planted and reference stands. Avicennia schaueriana
   was the dominant species within both natural regeneration and old-growth
   stands in terms of basal area (99.2 and 99.4 \%, 69.6 and 84.5 \%, and
   59.0 and 87.1 \% for Itacorubi, Saco Grande, and Ratones, respectively).
   Restoration stands were dominated by Laguncularia racemosa (80.6 and
   94.2 \% for Saco Grande and Ratones, respectively), except at one site
   (Itacorubi), where A. schaueriana prevailed (99.7 \%). Even though
   restoration and regeneration stands at Itacorubi showed similar species
   composition and dominance, cohort sorting revealed an inferior
   regeneration potential in the restoration stand. Multiple correlation
   analysis indicated that variables related to elevation disruptions (p
   (w) = 0.521) were the environmental drivers responsible for the
   differences observed in forest structure. At restoration sites an
   impaired pattern of secondary succession was observed, indicating that
   single species plantings may be ineffective if characteristics of the
   site, as well as of the area surrounding it, are not considered. The
   inadequate management of restoration sites can therefore have
   implications for both immediate and long-term large-scale ecosystem
   services.},

   spectral signatures were determined for 14 land-cover classes, including
   upland and floodplain forest, three stages of secondary succession, palm
   forest, mangrove, pasture, and three types of savanna. Image
   classification (unsupervised and supervised using a hybrid
   maximum-likelihood/texture algorithm) of the study area was conducted
   using the 14 class spectral statistics informed by 1992 vegetation
   inventories and field studies documenting historical land use. The use
   of field-based information supportive of classification resulted in
   individual rest field class results which ranged from 81 to 100 percent
   individual class accuracy. Historically, attainment of good accuracy for
   many of these classes using satellite data has been difficult, but this
   research indicates suitable accuracy can be obtained using TM data when
   carefully integrated with detailed ground surveys. Elements of the
   classification were focused on addressing the difficult problem of
   identifying the conversion of `'natural'' to `'managed'' floodplain
   forest. The combination of feature classification using
   computer-analyzed TM data in conjunction with detailed ground
   measurements/surveys permitted identification of subtle changes in
   natural forest that was associated with conversion to managed floodplain

   new insights from forest succession, forest fragmentation and landscape

Abstract = {Old-growth tropical forests are being extensively deforested and
   fragmented worldwide. Yet forest recovery through succession has led to
   an expansion of secondary forests in human-modified tropical landscapes
   (HMTLs). Secondary forests thus emerge as a potential repository for
   tropical biodiversity, and also as a source of essential ecosystem
   functions and services in HMTLs. Such critical roles are controversial,
   however, as they depend on successional, landscape and socio-economic
   dynamics, which can vary widely within and across landscapes and
   regions. Understanding the main drivers of successional pathways of
   disturbed tropical forests is critically needed for improving
   management, conservation, and restoration strategies. Here, we combine
   emerging knowledge from tropical forest succession, forest fragmentation
   and landscape ecology research to identify the main driving forces
   shaping successional pathways at different spatial scales. We also
   explore causal connections between land-use dynamics and the level of
   predictability of successional pathways, and examine potential
   implications of such connections to determine the importance of
   secondary forests for biodiversity conservation in HMTLs. We show that
   secondary succession (SS) in tropical landscapes is a multifactorial
   phenomenon affected by a myriad of forces operating at multiple
   spatio-temporal scales. SS is relatively fast and more predictable in
   recently modified landscapes and where well-preserved biodiversity-rich
   native forests are still present in the landscape. Yet the increasing
   variation in landscape spatial configuration and matrix heterogeneity in
   landscapes with intermediate levels of disturbance increases the
   uncertainty of successional pathways. In landscapes that have suffered
   extensive and intensive human disturbances, however, succession can be
   slow or arrested, with impoverished assemblages and reduced potential to
   deliver ecosystem functions and services. We conclude that: (i)
   succession must be examined using more comprehensive explanatory models,
   providing information about the forces affecting not only the presence
   but also the persistence of species and ecological groups, particularly
   of those taxa expected to be extirpated from HMTLs; (ii) SS research
   should integrate new aspects from forest fragmentation and landscape
   ecology research to address accurately the potential of secondary
   forests to serve as biodiversity repositories; and (iii) secondary
   forest stands, as a dynamic component of HMTLs, must be incorporated as
   key elements of conservation planning; i.e. secondary forest stands must
   be actively managed (e.g. using assisted forest restoration) according
   to conservation goals at broad spatial scales.},

Abstract = {Background: Habitat loss and fragmentation have been argued to
   drastically alter the composition of tree assemblages inhabiting small
   forest fragments but the successional trajectory experienced by such
   edge-affected habitats remains controversial.Aims: Here we examine
   whether small fragments (3.4-91.2ha) support seedling assemblages more
   similar to those in 10-70-year-old secondary forests than to those in
   mature forests, in order to infer to what extent fragments move toward
   early successional systems.Methods: Using 59 0.1-ha plots distributed in
   a fragmented landscape of Brazilian Atlantic forest, we evaluated
   species richness and functional and taxonomic composition of seedling
   assemblages in 20 small forest fragments, 19 stands of secondary forest
   and 20 stands of mature forests in the interior of an exceptionally
   large fragment (ca. 3500ha).Results: Small fragments presented the least
   species-rich seedling assemblages (17.25.7 species), followed by
   secondary (22.5 +/- 5.3), and mature forest (28.4 +/- 5.3). Small
   fragments had seedling assemblages with functional and taxonomic
   composition more similar to those in secondary than in mature forest.
   Small fragments had a greater relative richness and abundance of pioneer
   trees (ca. 40\% more), vertebrate-dispersed (6-25\%), and those bearing
   medium-sized seeds (30-70\%), while large-seeded species and individuals
   were reduced (>50\% decrement) in comparison to seedling assemblages in
   mature forest.Conclusions: By comparing seedlings across a wide range of
   successional habitats we offer evidence that small forest fragments are
   experiencing an alternative successional pathway towards an
   early-successional system with reduced plant diversity.},

Abstract = {Hedgerows are linear structures found in agricultural landscapes that
   may facilitate dispersal of plants and animals and also serve as
   habitat. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationships
   among diversity and ecological traits of woody plants, hedgerow
   characteristics (size, age, and origin), and the structure of the
   surrounding Atlantic Forest landscape. Field data were collected from 14
   hedgerows, and landscape metrics from 1000-m buffers surrounding
   hedgerows were recorded from a thematic map. In all sampled hedgerows,
   arboreal species were predominantly zoochoric and early-succession
   species, and hedgerow width was an important factor explaining the
   richness and abundance of this group of species. Connection with forest
   vegetation did not explain richness and abundance of animal-dispersed
   species, but richness of non-zoochoric species increased in more
   connected hedgerows. These results suggest that hedgerows are probably
   colonized by species arriving from nearby early-succession sites, forest
   fragment edges, and isolated trees in the matrix. Nonetheless, hedgerows
   provide resources for frugivorous animals and influence landscape
   connectivity, highlighting the importance of these elements in the
   conservation of biodiversity in fragmented and rural landscapes.},

Abstract = {Land-use change is the main driver of global biodiversity loss, but its
   relative impact on species turnover (-diversity) across multiple spatial
   scales remains unclear. Plant communities in fragmented rain forests can
   undergo declines (floristic homogenization) or increases (floristic
   differentiation) in -diversity. We tested these alternative hypotheses
   analysing a large vegetation data base from a hierarchically nested
   sampling design (450 plots in 45 forest patches in 3 landscapes with
   different deforestation levels) at Los Tuxtlas rain forest, Mexico.
   Differences in -diversity across spatial scales (i.e. among plots, among
   patches, and among landscapes) were analysed using multiplicative
   diversity decompositions of Hill numbers. Plant -diversity among plots
   within forest patches decreased in landscapes with higher deforestation
   levels, leading to floristic homogenization within patches. This
   homogenization process can be explained by the loss of rare and
   shade-tolerant plant species, and the recruitment and dominance of
   disturbance-adapted species, and can limit the accumulation of species
   (-diversity) in landscapes with higher deforestation. Nevertheless, the
   landscape with the highest deforestation level showed the highest
   floristic differentiation among patches. This landscape showed the
   greatest isolation distances between patches; a landscape spatial
   pattern that can limit the interchange of seeds (and species) between
   patches. Because the study patches are undergoing secondary succession
   following disturbances (e.g. logging, edge effects), different
   disturbance regimes and increased distance among patches could lead to
   higher -diversity.Synthesis. These findings indicate that patterns of
   floristic homogenization and differentiation depend on the landscape
   configuration and on the spatial scale of analysis. At the landscape
   scale, our results suggest that, in accordance with non-equilibrium
   dynamics and the landscape-divergence hypothesis, patches located in
   landscapes with different forest cover and different connectivity can
   experience contrasting successional pathways due to increasing levels of
   compositional differentiation between patches. These novel findings add
   further uncertainties to the maintenance of biodiversity in severely
   deforested tropical landscapes and have key ecological implications for
   biodiversity conservation planning.},

Year = {2018},
Volume = {8},
Month = {JAN 22},
Abstract = {Carbon accumulation in tropical secondary forests may be limited in part
   by nitrogen (N) availability, but changes in N during tropical forest
   succession have rarely been quantified. We explored N cycle dynamics
   across a chronosequence of secondary tropical forests in the Mata
   Atlantica of Bahia, Brazil in order to understand how quickly the N
   cycle recuperates. We hypothesized that N fixation would decline over
   the course of succession as N availability and N gaseous losses
   increased. We measured N fixation, KCl-extractable N, net mineralization
   and nitrification, resin-strip sorbed N, gaseous N emissions and the
   soil delta N-15 in stands that were 20, 35, 50, and > 50 years old.
   Contrary to our initial hypothesis, we found no significant differences
   between stand ages in any measured variable. Our findings suggest that
   secondary forests in this region of the Atlantic forest reached
   pre-disturbance N cycling dynamics after just 20 years of succession.
   This result contrasts with previous study in the Amazon, where the N
   cycle recovered slowly after abandonment from pasture reaching
   pre-disturbance N cycling levels after similar to 50 years of
   succession. Our results suggest the pace of the N cycle, and perhaps
   tropical secondary forest, recovery, may vary regionally.},

Abstract = {Exotic species are used to trigger facilitation in restoration
   plantings, but this positive effect may not be permanent and these
   species may have negative effects later on. Since such species can
   provide a marketable product (firewood), their harvest may represent an
   advantageous strategy to achieve both ecological and economic benefits.
   In this study, we looked at the effect of removal of a non-native tree
   species (Mimosa caesalpiniifolia) on the understory of a semideciduous
   forest undergoing restoration. We assessed two 14-year-old plantation
   systems (modified ``taungya{''} agroforestry system; and mixed
   plantation using commercial timber and firewood tree species)
   established at two sites with contrasting soil properties in So Paulo
   state, Brazil. The experimental design included randomized blocks with
   split plots. The natural regeneration of woody species (height a parts
   per thousand yen0.2 m) was compared between managed (all M.
   caesalpiniifolia trees removed) and unmanaged plots during the first
   year after the intervention. The removal of M. caesalpiniifolia
   increased species diversity but decreased stand basal area.
   Nevertheless, the basal area loss was recovered after 1 year. The
   management treatment affected tree species regeneration differently
   between species groups. The results of this study suggest that removal
   of M. caesalpiniifolia benefited the understory and possibly accelerated
   the succession process. Further monitoring studies are needed to
   evaluate the longer term effects on stand structure and composition. The
   lack of negative effects of tree removal on the natural regeneration
   indicates that such interventions can be recommended, especially
   considering the expectations of economic revenues from tree harvesting
   in restoration plantings.},

Abstract = {Forest fragmentation and the use of landscape matrices by agricultural
   and forest cultures can change the species composition such that these
   will no longer reflect the structure of the native forests. Thus,
   fragments can lose their potential to provide propagules for restoration
   once they lose species, or when its structure is changed due to
   fragmentation. The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential of a
   network of remnant forest fragments formed +/- 60 years ago on a farm to
   act as a propagule source for a natural regeneration process. The study
   area belongs to the Ombrophilous Mixed Forest (FOM) formation and is
   used in the production of exotic forest species. The 798 ha area is
   located in the Ponte Alta (SC) municipality. Data from phytosociological
   surveys of this formation were used for comparison, using curves based
   on the individual rarefaction, distribution of the six most abundant
   species, proportion of species and zoochoric individual, and similarity
   analysis in between different areas. The forest fragment showed
   compatible species richness and at certain times higher than can be
   found in other FOM situations. Mimosa scabrella was the most abundant
   species differing from other surveys. The amount of species with
   zoochoric dispersion mechanisms was similar to what was expected of FOM
   formations, however, the quantity of zoochoric individuals was below
   expected. The results indicate that the fragments show potential to act
   as propagule sources in the restoration process within the farm areas.
   Nonetheless, the capacity can be rather limited once the fragments show
   some different characteristics of other Araucaria's forests.},

Abstract = {Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) play an important role in the dynamic
   of plant community in the south American Atlantic Rainforest biome. Even
   in protected areas, this biome is under several anthropic impacts, which
   can cause shifts in the soil microbiota, including AMF. This study aimed
   to determine the structure and composition of AMF community in areas of
   native Atlantic Forest and in natural regeneration and to identify which
   abiotic factors are influencing this community in these areas. Soil
   samples were collected at Monte Pascoal National and Historical Park, in
   Southern Bahia, in native and natural regeneration areas of Atlantic
   Forest in two seasons (rainy and dry). Greater number of glomerospores
   and richness and diversity of AMF were found in the area under
   regeneration, with differences between seasons being observed only for
   the number of glomerospores. Seventy-seven species of AMF were recorded,
   considering all areas and seasons, with Acaulospora and Glomus being the
   most representative genera. Greater abundance of species of the genera
   Acaulospora, Claroideoglomus, and Septoglomus was found in the
   regeneration area. The AMF community differed between the study areas,
   but not between seasons, with soil attributes (pH, K, Al, Mg, m, and
   clay) structuring factors for this difference in the AMF community.
   Atlantic Forest areas in natural regeneration and the soil edaphic
   factors provide changes in the structure and composition of the AMF
   community, increasing the richness and diversity of these fungi in

   a floodplain forest in the municipality of Macapa-AP. We sought to
   answer questions about the pattern of spatial distribution of the
   population and spatial distribution in relation to the mother plant. An
   area of 1 ha was demarcated, defined 10 matrices with diameter at breast
   height (DBH) >= 10 cm. Four transects were established in each of these
   matrices, oriented by cardinal points. To assess whether there is a
   difference between the number of comparisons between the cardinal
   points, the Kruskal-Wallis test was used. In the transects, a census of
   the regenerants was carried out, measuring the diameter at ground height
   (DAS <3 cm) and height. A total of 2,606 regenerants were registered,
   the subplots that overloud density were available in the mother plant,
   the spatial distribution of the regenerants was grouped, and their
   structure in DAS and height depicted on the first classes. There was no
   significant difference between the number of desired per transect.
   Present regenerants of M. paraensis aggregate of aggregate distribution.
   The area has an abundance of regenerants, distributed among the cardinal
   points and which tend to concentrate on the mother plant.},

Abstract = {Habitat loss is one of the primary drivers of change in forest
   biodiversity and ecosystem function worldwide. The synergetic effects of
   habitat loss and fragmentation might lead to profound impacts on forest
   structure and composition, conducting forest fragments towards early
   successional stages (retrogressive succession). In this study, we tested
   this hypothesis by evaluating how landscape-scale forest loss affects
   the forest structure. We sampled forest structure descriptors in 40
   forest sites in landscapes ranging from 3 to 100\% forest cover. Forest
   cover was negatively related to most of the structural variables,
   generally in a non-linear manner. In contrast, dead trees and logging
   were ubiquitous and not related to forest cover. The forest remnants in
   more deforested landscapes retain early successional forest attributes,
   with tree assemblages that are less dense, shorter, thinner, with an
   overall basal area loss, and with increasing canopy openness. This
   structural degradation indicates that landscape-scale forest loss
   strongly determines the trajectory of the local forest structure,
   pushing forests to a retrogressive succession process, which is more
   likely to occur in deforested landscapes and can lead to functional
   forest erosion. Our findings indicate that remnants within deforested
   landscapes may suffer recruitment limitation, primarily of large trees.
   Additionally, the forest structure characteristics were more severely
   degraded in landscapes with less than 40\% forest cover. In the face of
   these results, the recommendation is to avoid the reduction of forest
   cover below this threshold, at which point structural erosion becomes
   more severe, with predictable negative consequences on biodiversity and
   ecosystem service maintenance. (C) 016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {Nearly all published rates of secondary forest (SF) regrowth for
   Amazonia are inferred from chronosequences. We examined SF regrowth on
   abandoned pastures over a 4-year period to determine if measured rates
   of forest recovery differ from chronosequence predictions. We studied
   the emergence, development and death of over 1300 stems in 10 SFs
   representing three age classes (< 1-5, 6-10 and 11-14 years old). Mean
   tree biomass accumulation in both the < 1-5 and 6-10 years old (4.4 and
   5.7 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1), respectively) abandoned pastures was lower than
   predicted and deviated significantly (57\% and 41\%) from rates
   estimated from the chronosequence. The older SFs, with a mean growth
   rate of 9.9 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1) followed the rate predicted by the
   chronosequence. Understocking was the primary cause of low biomass
   recovery rates in the youngest forests; although the youngest stands had
   a diameter at breast height increment three times the oldest stands, the
   youngest stands lacked sufficient density to cumulatively produce high
   biomass accumulation rates. Four years of measurement indicated that the
   youngest stands had developed 59\% of the stems measured in the older
   stands during the same time period. The 6-10-year-old stands were
   rapidly self-thinning and approached stem density values measured in the
   same aged stands at the onset of the study. Mortality was high for all
   stands, with 54\% of the original stems remaining after 4 years in
   intermediate-aged stands. The forests were dominated by the tree Vismia,
   which represented 55-66\% of the biomass in all stands. The Vismia share
   of the biomass was decreasing over time, with other genera replacing the
   pioneer. Our measured rates of regrowth indicate that generalized
   estimates of forest regrowth through chronosequence studies will
   overestimate forest regrowth for the youngest forests that were under
   land use for longer time-periods before abandonment. Certified Emission
   Reductions under the Clean Development Mechanism of the Kyoto protocol
   should consider these results when predicting and compensating for
   carbon sequestered under natural forest management.},

Abstract = {We assessed seed fate of six tree species in a seasonally deciduous
   forest of Central Brazil. Seed germination, predation, removal and death
   caused by pathogens or dessication were followed in an undisturbed
   forest site, a logged forest site, and an active pasture. In both forest
   types we sowed seeds under patches of liana tangles (Low Forest habitat)
   and under patches of mature forest (High Forest habitat). Seeds were
   monitored weekly for up to 8 months. Overall, small-seeded species
   (Astronium fraxinifolium and Tabebuia impetiginosa) had high
   germination, although germination was lower in the pasture due to insect
   predation. The hard-coated seeds of Erythrina sp. had higher germination
   rates in the pasture. The large-seeded Cavanillesia arborea and Swartzia
   multijuga had high seed removal (ca. 90\%) in the pasture and under High
   Forest, but only 23-34\% under Low Forest in the logged site. Lower
   removal of large seeds in Low Forest suggests that this habitat conceals
   the seeds and constrains the movement of large mammals. Both species
   were favored in Low Forest, suggesting that caution should be used when
   managing lianas. When protected from predation, seeds with a soft coat
   and high water content, such as the seeds of Eugenia dysenterica and S.
   multijuga, died from desiccation in the pasture. Restoration efforts
   must take into consideration high mortality caused by desiccation or
   insect predation in abandoned pastures of dry forests. (c) 2006 Elsevier

   backscatter (sigma degrees) from, polarimetric L-band SAR data
   (collected by the airborne sensor R99-B/SIPAM) and biophysical
   parameters of the primary forest and secondary succession sites. The
   area under study is located in the region of Tapajos (Brazil), where SAR
   data were collected in May 2005. Another approach under investigation is
   the evaluation of the contribution from basic backscatter mechanisms,
   using the Freeman-Durden decomposition technique, applied to complex SAR
   images, where the physiognomic-structural characteristics of the forest
   stands give a significant contribution. In brief, it was possible to
   verify that the variable ``tree height{''} has better relations with the
   backscatter values, when compared to other biophysical variables,
   especially when the model also includes variations of the incidence
   angle of the stripes imaged. The decomposition technique showed that the
   volumetric scattering component has the strongest influence on the SAR
   response at primary and secondary tropical forests.},

Abstract = {Key message This paper shows the intraspecific plant responses in leaf
   morphology, herbivory and FA between mature and successional tropical
   dry forests, as well as the difficulty associated with understanding the
   relationship between FA and herbivory Understanding the processes that
   affect biotic interactions during secondary succession has implications
   for the maintenance of species diversity in the tropics. We studied the
   changes in leaf morphology, fluctuating asymmetry (FA) and herbivory in
   three dominant tropical dry forest plant species that occur in mature
   and secondary forests. We selected eight study sites: four in mature and
   four in successional forests. At each site, a plot of 20 x 50 m was
   established to characterize the vegetation structure and soil fertility.
   Subsequently, leaf morphology, FA and herbivory were measured in all
   individuals of Cordia elaeagnoides, C. alliodora and Achatocarpus
   gracilis with DBH >= 2.5 cm found in the plots. Plant abundance and
   plant height decreased in secondary forest, while the content of
   nitrates and phosphates increased in soil of secondary forests.
   Differences in leaf morphology between forest conditions were found for
   the three species. Total leaf area was higher in mature than in
   secondary forests for C. elaeagnoides and A. gracilis. An opposite
   pattern was found for C. alliodora. In both Cordia species, herbivory
   was higher in secondary than in mature forests. The opposite pattern was
   found for A. gracilis in secondary forests. For all the cases, FA was
   higher in mature forests than in secondary forests. Herbivory was
   positively correlated with FA in secondary forests in C. elaeganoides
   and in A. gracilis, whereas in C. alliodora herbivory was positively
   related with FA in mature forests. Overall, we detected changes in
   foliar morphology, fluctuating asymmetry and herbivory between mature
   and secondary forests, with a general pattern of higher FA levels in
   mature forests. Our findings illustrate the difficulty associated with
   understanding the relationship between FA and herbivory throughout the
   regeneration process in tropical dry forests due to the complexity of
   abiotic and biotic factors that can affect plant-herbivore interactions.},

Abstract = {Understanding the relationships between Coffea arabica L. and the native
   tree community of secondary forests regrowing after the abandonment of
   coffee plantations is important because, as a non-native species in the
   Neotropics, coffee can outcompete native species, reducing diversity and
   forests ecosystem services. We aimed to answer three questions: 1) Does
   coffee regeneration in secondary forests differ between shaded and
   unshaded abandoned plantations?; 2) How is coffee basal area related to
   structural attributes, species diversity and composition of the native
   community?; and 3) Do the relationships between coffee and native
   community differ between tree and sapling components? We sampled the
   tree and sapling components in a seasonal tropical dry forest that were
   previously used as shaded and unshaded coffee plantations. Coffee was
   the most important species in the sapling component of shaded systems,
   but was almost absent in unshaded ones. Coffee basal area was negatively
   related with the native density and absolute species richness of the
   sapling component; and was negatively related with tree density, and
   positively related with the percentage of pioneer individuals of the
   native tree component. Our results indicate that coffee persists in
   secondary forest communities even after more than 70 years of
   shaded-coffee plantations were abandoned, potentially reducing density
   and diversity of native species. Despite limitations, which hinder more
   general conclusions on coffee invasiveness in Brazilian secondary
   tropical forests, our results indicate that coffee is a strong
   competitor in the studied secondary forests and provide important
   insights for future research on this topic.},

Journal = {PLOS ONE},

Month = {JUN 9},
Abstract = {The regeneration of disturbed forest is an essential part of tropical
   forest ecology, both with respect to natural disturbance regimes and
   large-scale human-mediated logging, grazing, and agriculture. Pioneer
   tree species are critical for facilitating the transition from
   deforested land to secondary forest because they stabilize terrain and
   enhance connectivity between forest fragments by increasing matrix
   permeability and initiating disperser community assembly. Despite the
   ecological importance of early successional species, little is known
   about their ability to maintain gene flow across deforested landscapes.
   Utilizing highly polymorphic microsatellite markers, we examined
   patterns of genetic diversity and differentiation for the pioneer
   understory tree Miconia affinis across the Isthmus of Panama.
   Furthermore, we investigated the impact of geographic distance, forest
   cover, and elevation on genetic differentiation among populations using
   circuit theory and regression modeling within a landscape genetics
   framework. We report marked differences in historical and contemporary
   migration rates and moderately high levels of genetic differentiation in
   M. affinis populations across the Isthmus of Panama. Genetic
   differentiation increased significantly with elevation and geographic
   distance among populations; however, we did not find that forest cover
   enhanced or reduced genetic differentiation in the study region.
   Overall, our results reveal strong dispersal for M. affinis across
   human-altered landscapes, highlighting the potential use of this species
   for reforestation in tropical regions. Additionally, this study
   demonstrates the importance of considering topography when designing
   programs aimed at conserving genetic diversity within degraded tropical
   landscapes.},

   remnants. Plantations accumulated approximately 50\% more aboveground
   carbon than second-growth forests throughout the chronosequence. When
   controlling for soil clay content, soil carbon stocks were higher in
   reference than in restored forests, but they were comparable between
   plantations and second-growth forests. After 60 years of stand
   development, recovery of total carbon stocks in both restoration
   approaches reached only half of the average stocks of reference forests.
   Total cost-effectiveness for carbon accumulation, including both
   implementation and land opportunity costs, was on average 60\% higher
   for second-growth forests than for plantations (15.1 and 9.4 kgC
   US\$(-1), respectively). Although tree plantations initially showed
   higher rates of carbon storage than second-growth forests, their higher
   implementation and land opportunity costs make them less cost-effective
   for carbon farming. Our results further suggest that, at current pricing
   levels, carbon markets alone have a limited potential to up-scale
   restoration efforts in Brazil's Atlantic Forest.},

Abstract = {We discriminated different successional forest stages, forest
   degradation, and land use classes in the Tapajos National Forest (TNF),
   located in the Central Brazilian Amazon. We used full polarimetric
   images from ALOS/PALSAR-2 that have not yet been tested for land use and
   land cover (LULC) classification, neither for forest degradation
   classification in the TNF. Our specific objectives were: (1) to test the
   potential of ALOS/PALSAR-2 full polarimetric images to discriminate LULC
   classes and forest degradation; (2) to determine the optimum subset of
   attributes to be used in LULC classification and forest degradation
   studies; and (3) to evaluate the performance of Random Forest (RF) and
   Support Vector Machine (SVM) supervised classifications to discriminate
   LULC classes and forest degradation. PALSAR-2 images from 2015 and 2016
   were processed to generate Radar Vegetation Index, Canopy Structure
   Index, Volume Scattering Index, Biomass Index, and Cloude-Pottier, van
   Zyl, Freeman-Durden, and Yamaguchi polarimetric decompositions. To
   determine the optimum subset, we used principal component analysis in
   order to select the best attributes to discriminate the LULC classes and
   forest degradation, which were classified by RF. Based on the variable
   importance score, we selected the four first attributes for 2015, alpha,
   anisotropy, volumetric scattering, and double-bounce, and for 2016,
   entropy, anisotropy, surface scattering, and biomass index, subsequently
   classified by SVM. Individual backscattering indexes and polarimetric
   decompositions were also considered in both RF and SVM classifiers.
   Yamaguchi decomposition performed by RF presented the best results, with
   an overall accuracy (OA) of 76.9\% and 83.3\%, and Kappa index of 0.70
   and 0.80 for 2015 and 2016, respectively. The optimum subset classified
   by RF showed an OA of 75.4\% and 79.9\%, and Kappa index of 0.68 and
   0.76 for 2015 and 2016, respectively. RF exhibited superior performance
   in relation to SVM in both years. Polarimetric attributes exhibited an
   adequate capability to discriminate forest degradation and classes of
   different ecological succession from the ones with less vegetation

Title = {Litter inputs and standing stocks in riparian zones and streams under
   secondary forest and managed and abandoned cocoa agroforestry systems},
Journal = {PEERJ},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {Background: Cocoa is an important tropical tree crop that is mainly
   cultivated in agroforestry systems (AFS). This system, known as cabruca
   in northeastern Brazil, holds promise to reconcile biodiversity
   conservation and economic development. However, since cocoa AFS alters
   forest structure composition, it can affect litter dynamics in riparian
   zones and streams. Thus, our objective was to determine litter inputs
   and standing stocks in riparian zones and streams under three types of
   forest: managed cocoa AFS, abandoned cocoa AFS, and secondary forest.
   Methods: We determined terrestrial litter fall (TI), vertical (VI) and
   lateral (LI) litter inputs to streams, and litter standing stocks on
   streambeds (BS) in the Atlantic Forest of northeastern Brazil. Litter
   was collected every 30 days from August 2018 to July 2019 using
   custom-made traps. The litter was dried, separated into four fractions
   (leaves, branches, reproductive organs, and miscellaneous material) and
   weighed.
   Results: Terrestrial litter fall was similar in all forests, ranging
   from 89 g m(-2) month(-1) in secondary forest (SF) to 96 g m(-2)
   month(-1) in abandoned cocoa AFS (AC). Vertical input were higher in AC
   (82 g m(-2) month(-1)) and MC (69 g m(-2) month(-1)) than in SF (40 g
   m(-2) month(-1)), whereas lateral input were higher in MC (43 g m(2)
   month(-1)) than in AC (15 g m(2) month(-1)) and SF (24 g m(2)
   month(-1)). Standing stocks followed the order SF > AC > MC,
   corresponding to 425, 299 and 152 g m(2). Leaves contributed most to all
   litter fractions in all forests. Reproductive plant parts accounted for
   a larger proportion in managed AFS. Branches and miscellaneous litter
   were also similar in all forests, except for higher benthic standing
   stocks of miscellaneous litter in the SF. Despite differences in the
   amounts of litter inputs and standing stocks among the forests, seasonal
   patterns in the abandoned AFS (AC) were more similar to those of the
   secondary forest (SF) than the managed AFS, suggesting potential of
   abandoned AFS to restore litter dynamics resembling those of secondary
   forests.},

Abstract = {This study explores the possibility of estimating different stages of
   ecological succession in tropical dry forests using CHRIS/PROBA
   hyperspectral and multi-angular satellite images. Tropical dry forests
   (TDFs) in the Americas are considered one of the most threatened
   ecosystems in region, experiencing also high rates of secondary growth.
   In this study, TDFs are studied along three successional stages (early,
   intermediate and late) in sites across a latitudinal gradient in the
   Americas. Sites are located in Mexico, Nicaragua and Brazil. Due to
   their strong annual phenological signal, reflectance values of
   CHRIS/PROBA Mode-4 were extracted for the dry and wet season, and
   afterwards analyzed using scatterplots, n-D visualization tools, and
   Transformed Divergence separability tests. Spectral separation of three
   successional stages within TDFs was observed in images corresponding to
   the dry season, at all study sites. In this season, it is possible to
   discriminate the different successional stages in all viewing angles.
   For the spectral separation of the three successional stages in images
   of the wet season, it is required the use of the 18 bands of the sensor.
   Our analysis also indicates that better spectral separation is achieved
   at 550, in both seasons. Our results confirm the utility of
   multi-angular and hyperspectral sensors as a critical tool for
   environmental planning in TDFs environments. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All

Journal = {CATENA},

Abstract = {Swidden agriculture as a production system has been practiced for
   thousands of years, based on ecological processes of forest ecosystems.
   While this cultivation system has often been framed as contributing to
   environmental degradation, it can also be argued to be compatible with
   sustainable agricultural practices. Its sustainability strongly depends
   on the length of the recovery period, the period of secondary forest
   succession, after swidden agriculture. In this study we focused on soil
   fertility maintenance and recovery during secondary succession after
   swidden agriculture, compared to old-growth forests. Smallholders
   practiced a moderate form of swidden agriculture, abandoned the
   production field after one or two production cycles, and returned to the
   field after 10-15 years. Sampling took place in two traditional
   communities situated in the southeast portion of the Atlantic Rainforest
   at Sao Paulo state, Brazil. Soil samples were collected from forest
   fragments belonging to seven different Caicara families (descendants
   from Amerindians, African Brazilian and European colonizers). Our
   chronosequence spanned a period of sixty years, while the old-growth
   forests were 100 years old. In all 28 sites were sampled, of which 19
   were from ombrophilous forests on clay and 9 from restinga vegetation on
   sandy soil. Soils were analyzed for texture, macro- and micronutrient
   availability, bulk density, pH and nitrogen and carbon stocks. Linear
   regression, with clay content and fallow period as main factors, showed
   that successional age of the forest stand had only a significant effect
   on pH and Mn. Clay content of the soil influenced availability of
   nutrient bases and the CEC. Other soil properties, including stocks of
   carbon and nitrogen were not influenced by fallow period. Our data
   indicate that swidden agriculture might not lose key soil nutrients over
   time and hence can be considered an ecologically sustainable system in
   the region, challenging the negative perception of swidden agriculture.},

Abstract = {Tropical insectivorous birds comprise a diverse group that has a
   distinct response to habitat degradation. However, knowledge on birds'
   ecological functions and their large-scale functional responses to human
   impacts across various habitats is scarce. We sampled 22 1-km-radius
   buffer landscapes within the Cantareira-Mantiqueira region (south-east
   Brazil), including native forests, pastures and marshes, to assess how
   landscape and habitat characteristics might affect insectivorous birds
   within the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. We studied whether bird species
   and functional diversity might respond to habitat turnover and
   nestedness and to native forest cover using generalized linear mixed
   models. We found negative effects of increased native forest cover on
   functional diversity indices. Bird communities in pastures show more
   nestedness, whereas marsh areas exhibit higher turnover. Forest areas
   receive a balanced contribution from both nestedness and turnover. These
   results are attributable to the predominantly secondary growth and early
   successional stages of the native forest fragments in the region,
   emphasizing the connection between landscape characteristics, habitat
   types and bird functional diversity in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest.},

Abstract = {Context Neighbouring forests constitute biological sources that enable
   the succession from species-poor systems, such as tree-plantings, to
   highly diverse forests. However, old forest patches are becoming rare in
   tropical agricultural landscapes. Objective We were interested in if,
   and how, spontaneous regeneration under tree-plantings reflects the age
   and the amount of the neighbouring forest cover. We anticipated that
   older forests promote a compositionally broader recovery in neighbouring
   tree-plantings, because older forests likely include
   disturbance-sensitive species, particularly within least deforested
   landscapes. Methods We studied twenty-seven restoration sites
   implemented as tree-plantings in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. We
   quantified the effects of age and amount of neighbouring forest cover on
   structural and compositional characteristics of the regeneration
   community (dbh < 5 cm). We used two landscape groups (presence, or
   absence, of forests older than 30 years.) with a similar areal range of
   forest cover, enabling the disentanglement of forest age from forest
   amount effects on regeneration community responses. Results
   Surprisingly, we found that greater forest cover correlated with denser
   and more species-rich regeneration communities only when neighbouring
   forests were young. This pattern was promoted by non-vertebrate
   dispersed species. Regeneration communities in tree-plantings near to
   young forests had lower seed-mass and relative abundances of
   forest-specialists, compared to communities found near old forest
   patches. Conclusion Regeneration is likely denser in landscapes of vast
   young-forest coverage. However, small-seeded and habitat-generalist
   species, frequently related to disturbance tolerance, tend to be
   dominant if old-growth forests are far away. This biased seed source
   appears to preclude the restoration of typical historic tropical forest
   composition.},

Abstract = {Vegetation natural regeneration after agricultural abandonment is
   changing the landscape patterns in many areas worldwide. However, the
   expansion rate, spatio-temporal dynamics, and the role of past
   vegetation cover in shaping such patterns are still barely quantified in
   fine and meso scales. Here, we aim to quantify the expansion rate and
   assess the spatio-temporal patterns and the effects of past cover on
   natural woody vegetation cover increase. We sampled woodland and
   shrubland cover from 1992 to 2016 in 30 ha in a formerly managed
   pastureland in Sicily, Italy. We combined field sampling, GIS tools, and
   spatial analysis to assess the spatial structure dynamics and test the
   effects of past cover amount and type and distance from forest or
   nearest woody patch on the proportional expansion of natural
   regeneration. After 24 years, woody cover increased 68\%, despite the
   aggregated spatial structure in 1992 remaining almost unchanged in 2016.
   The past vegetation cover was the best predictor of woody vegetation
   expansion in two out of three plots. Distance to continuous forest and
   to the nearest woody patch, as well as cover type, was not relevant. Our
   study highlights the importance of fine- and meso-scale studies to
   reveal both the deterministic and stochastic facet of woody vegetation
   dynamics. Natural regeneration may strongly change landscape patterns
   even under constant herbivory pressure and long-term deforestation. The
   detection of cold and hotspots of regeneration provide an important
   prompt for the design of restoration programs and landscape management.},

Abstract = {The potential of regeneration of native species under homogeneous forest
   planting is considered an important factor for the maintenance of the
   diversity and the wealth of native forest species. Thus, this study
   aimed to evaluate the natural regeneration of the underbrush of an
   Eucalyptus grandis stand, located in the municipality of Frederico
   Westphalen, RS. There were installed 10 parcels of 10 m x 10 m, in which
   there were measured all the individuals with equal or higher height than
   1 m. The sampled species were distributed in height classes or diameter
   classes and classified in relation to the successional class and
   dispersal syndrome. There were calculated the indexes of Shannon
   diversity and of Pielou evenness. In total, there were sampled 414
   individuals; the floristic of the area includes 32 species distributed
   in 20 families and 30 genera. The Myrtaceae family, presented the
   greatest richness of species, and the Prunus myrtifolia and Sebastiania
   commersoniana were the species with greater number of individuals. The
   index of Shannon diversity was estimated in 2.36 nats. ind.-1. The
   natural regeneration showed itself diverse, with predominance of initial
   and later secondary species, highlighting that the stand of Eucalyptus
   grandis performed as facilitator of natural regeneration.},

Abstract = {Hydroelectric dams represent an important threat to seasonally flooded
   environments in the Amazon basin. We aimed to evaluate how a dam in the
   Madeira River, one of the largest tributaries of the Amazonas River,
   affected floodplain avifauna. Bird occurrence was recorded through
   simultaneous passive acoustic monitoring in early successional
   vegetation and floodplain forest downstream from the dam and upstream in
   sites impacted by permanent flooding after dam reservoir filling.
   Species were identified through manual inspection and semi-automated
   classification of the recordings. To assess the similarity in vegetation
   between downstream and upstream sites, we used Landsat TM/ETM+ composite
   images from before (2009-2011) and after (2016-2018) reservoir filling.
   Downstream and upstream floodplain forest sites were similar before, but
   not after dam construction. Early successional vegetation sites were
   already different before dam construction. We recorded 195 bird species.
   While species richness did not differ between upstream and downstream
   sites, species composition differed significantly. Ten species were
   indicators of early successional vegetation upstream, and four
   downstream. Ten species were indicators of floodplain forest upstream,
   and 31 downstream. Seven of 24 floodplain specialist species were
   detected by the semi-automated classification only upstream. While we
   found some bird species characteristic of early successional vegetation
   in the upstream sites, we did not find most species characteristic of
   tall floodplain forest. Predominantly carnivorous, insectivorous, and
   nectarivorous species appear to have been replaced by generalist and
   widely distributed species.},

Abstract = {We analysed spectral and textural attributes from the Advanced Land
   Imager (ALI)/EO-1 for land-cover mapping and inspected their correlation
   with biophysical parameters of primary and secondary forests from

   the most relevant spectral/textural attributes, which were combined for
   classification of the ALI scene. From the ANN land-cover map, areas
   classified as primary forest (PF), initial (SS1), intermediate (SS2) and
   advanced (SS3) stages of secondary succession were studied. Biophysical
   parameters were determined from field inventory of 40 sample plots.
   Results showed an overall classification accuracy of 79\% using
   reflectance and 89\% using the combined data set. The combined data set
   included the reflectance of ALI bands 3-9 and the texture metrics mean
   (bands 3-4; 6-8) and dissimilarity (band 8). The reflectance of the
   near-infrared/shortwave infrared bands and their texture mean decreased
   from SS1 to SS3/PF. The gradient between primary and secondary forests
   controlled the correlations of reflectance with biophysical parameters.
   While the aboveground biomass, basal area, leaf area index, tree height
   and canopy cover increased from SS1 to SS3/PF, the reflectance decreased
   with the development of canopy structure and the resultant canopy
   shadows. The mean was the only texture metric correlated with

Title = {Forest restoration and hydrology},
Journal = {FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {520},
Month = {SEP 15},
Abstract = {Forest restoration aims to increase forest cover, structure, function,
   and/or species composition, and it influences hydrology through the
   partitioning of precipitation into evapotranspiration and streamflow.
   This paper provides a conceptual framework for forest restoration and
   hydrology, reviews the literature on forest hydrology that is relevant
   to forest restoration, and assesses practical forest restoration
   approaches, their hydrologic effects, and tradeoffs. The hydrologic
   effects of three types of forest are assessed: mature and old-growth
   forests, which often are the reference model for restoration; managed
   forest plantations, which dominated early efforts for forest
   restoration; and the early stages of native forest succession, an
   increasingly popular, ecologically-oriented or nature-based approach to
   forest restoration. This review indicates that mature and old-growth
   forests have high evapotranspiration and consistent water yield,
   provided by moderated peak discharges and sustained low flows, while
   water yield is low from managed forest plantations, especially during
   dry periods. The early stages of native forest succession may provide
   greater water yield and increased low flows compared with managed
   plantations. Inclusion of native species and natural processes in forest
   restoration can increase some hydrological benefits relative to other
   forest restoration approaches. Although forest restoration affects
   hydrology, few studies examine the hydrologic effects of specific forest
   restoration practices such as choice of species, silvicultural
   practices, legacies of past land use, and geographic setting. Forest
   managers and ecologists can play valuable roles by designing studies
   that explore the hydrologic effects of forest restoration approaches on
   time scales relevant to ecological succession and forest management
   under a changing climate.},

Title = {Consequences of habitat disturbance on seed fate of a Brazilian tropical

Year = {2015},
Volume = {40},

Abstract = {We compared seed fate (survival, mortality by rodent predators,
   desiccation and other causes) of the tree Cavanillesia arborea
   (Malvaceae) in preserved old-growth tropical dry forests and in nearby
   abandoned pasturelands in Brazil. For this purpose, we performed an
   experiment where 15 seeds were placed in the surroundings of 15 parental
   individuals in each habitat. These 450 seeds were monitored over four
   months. At the end of the experiment, seed predation by rodents was
   higher in forest (56.5\%) than in pasture (8.9\%) areas, but seed
   desiccation showed the opposite pattern (8.9\% vs. 80.4\%). Mortality by
   desiccation was also faster in pasture than in forest areas, probably
   reducing their attractiveness to predators in these areas. None of the
   seeds placed in the pasture survived, whereas 26.2\% of seeds became
   seedlings in forest areas. The absence of seedling recruitment of
   Cavanillesia arborea in pastures is likely a consequence of their
   incapacity to tolerate the harsh abiotic conditions in this habitat.
   Thus, forest conversion imposes a strong limitation to the long-term
   population viability of this species. However, restoration and natural
   regeneration of abandoned pastures can recreate the forest structure and
   microclimatic conditions favourable to seed germination and seedling
   establishment. Remnant individuals of Cavanillesia arborea in
   agricultural landscapes may have a negligible contribution to current
   recruitment, but they can attract potential dispersers of pioneer
   species, with positive feedbacks to future recruitment during secondary
   succession.},

   reduced the number of seedlings when compared to base cut. Root removal
   differed statistically from the control and base cut treatments. Base

   Southern Brazil: Adding value to restored landscapes},
Journal = {FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {495},
Month = {SEP 1},
Abstract = {The Brazilian Atlantic forest is largely covered by secondary forests,
   mostly regenerated after the abandonment of patches previously used for
   shifting cultivation. A characteristic of these secondary forests is the
   significant timber volume from fast-growing species at ages as young as
   30-40 years. In this study, we investigated changes that occur in timber
   production of secondary forest during the first 50 years of succession.
   We inventoried 82 plots (10 x 20 m) in a chronosequence ranging from 2
   to 50 years since agricultural abandonment in four municipalities
   located in Santa Catarina State, Southern Brazil. Our results showed
   that commercial tree species have rapid recovery of richness, basal area
   and stem volume in naturally regenerating forests. Commercial species
   represent about 51 percent of tree diversity, with 9 out of 12 dominant
   species being commercial timber species, with a stem volume up to 155
   m(3) ha(-1). Trees of commercial species with >= 15 cm in diameter are
   first observed after 20 years of succession, while trees >= 30 cm are
   found at 30 years of succession, and produce 126 m(3) ha(-1) of stem
   volume. We highlight Hyeronima alchorneoides, Miconia cabucu and Miconia
   cinnamomifolia, as fast-growing dominant species that produce timber
   quality >20 cm in diameter after 20 years of succession, with volume
   reaching 200 m(3) ha(-1) before 40 years of succession. We found that
   secondary forests are dominated by fast-growing and wood-producing
   species, with a rapid increase in timber stocks in the early stages of
   succession. These secondary forests are important biodiversity
   reservoirs in human-pressured landscapes, in addition to providing
   forest products and other ecosystem services. The management of
   secondary forests may be an alternative restoration approach that can
   accelerate the recovery of timber stocks, provide landscape diversity,
   and add more value to private forests.},

   Forest fragment in Rio de Janeiro State, Brazil},
Journal = {BIOTA NEOTROPICA},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {15},
Number = {2},
Abstract = {The State of Rio de Janeiro still holds unknown portions of the Atlantic
   Forest, which represent gaps in the knowledge of this ecosystem.
   Paracambi and neighbor municipal districts comprise a vast stretch of
   virtually unknown forest that makes up part of the Serra do Mar
   biodiversity corridor. The following study describes the tree community
   structure in a stretch of the ombrophilous Atlantic Forest, in the
   Parque Natural Municipal do Curio (Curio MNP), Paracambi, Rio de
   Janeiro, which serves as the basis to evaluate species diversity and
   conservation status. The altitudes in the area ranges from 100 to 690 m
   and the climate varies from mild subtropical to tropical hot and humid.
   Forty plots (10x10m) were randomly placed along the area, where all the
   stems equal to or greater than five centimeters (5 cm) diameter at
   breast high from ground level were measured. A total of 749 individuals,
   pertaining to 128 genera and 210 species were recorded, eight of which
   are listed as threatened of extinction in the Brazilian flora. The
   Shannon-Weaver diversity index (H') was 4.7 nat.ind.(-1) and the species
   with greater importance value was Pseudopiptadenia contorta (1.6460
   m(2); 18 individuals) while the most common species were Senefeldera
   vertcilata (48) and Actinostemon verticilatus (47 individuals). Despite
   the sample area being a little smaller than that commonly adopted in
   tropical studies, data pointed to a richness hitherto not registered in
   any other study for the State of Rio de Janeiro, no matter the inclusion
   criteria used, and also confirmed by the two estimator indices used,
   which have revealed very similar results. The vertical forest structure,
   the values associated to the successional stage of the species and other
   aspects of community structure indicate that the Curio MNP encompasses
   forest stretches in advanced stages of ecological succession. Besides
   its key location for the connectivity of forest fragments in the region,
   the results emphasize the ecological importance of this forest remnant
   and the need for its conservation.},

Volume = {29},
Abstract = {Background: Managed Caatinga forests in Northeast Brazil are an
   important source of wood products, however, successful regeneration and
   regrowth is important to guarantee sustainability in these forests. The
   main objective of this study was to evaluate the natural regeneration
   and forest regrowth ability of a Caatinga forest under varying clear-cut
   treatments, as well as to estimate the recovery time of stand
   parameters.Results: An experiment was set up in Petrolina, Pernambuco
   state, Brazil, comparing five clear-cut strip widths: 0, 40, 60, 80 and
   100 meters. Forest inventory data was gathered before and eight years
   after harvesting in 19 plots of 10 x 40 m. Tree seedling regeneration
   (individuals with circumference at breast height < 6 cm and minimum
   height of 0.5 m) was also monitored in 5 x 5 m sub plots, before
   harvesting, one, three and eight years after harvesting.Conclusions: No
   influence of the clear-cut strip width on regeneration and forest
   regrowth ability was detected, with all treatments presenting similar
   growth and tree species diversity and similarity values. The estimated
   growth rates of the clear-cut plots were of 0.12 m2 \& BULL;ha-1 \&
   BULL;year-1 and 0.39 m3 \& BULL;ha-1 \& BULL;year-1 for basal area and

   in unexpected ways, or becoming stabilized in a non desirable
   intermediate stage of blocked succession. In order to elucidate the
   successional trajectory of the plant community in a 20 ha patch of
   riparian Atlantic Forest (southeastern Brazil) undergoing restoration,
   we assessed native tree and shrub species regenerating at 18, 28 and 38
   years after planting. We analyzed changes in floristic composition and
   proportions of functional traits, by comparison with the set of 166
   species originally planted most of which were non-native, and with the
   plant assemblages of two reference riparian ecosystems - a primary-type
   and a secondary forest, in the same eco-region. Despite isolation from
   extant forests, immigrating native species have enriched and dominated
   the community undergoing restoration. Thus, the floristic composition
   and the proportions of species among functional guilds is becoming more
   distinct through time from the set of species planted and more similar
   to the nearest secondary forest (1.6 km), but is still dramatically
   different from that of a primary forest 50 km away. The proportions of
   functional guilds among individuals regenerating have shown stability
   over time but differ in general from the primary forest, particularly
   for the higher proportion of zoochorous plants in the forest undergoing
   restoration. The proportion of non-native species as well as of
   individuals of these species in the community have decreased over time,
   even though they were the majority of the species planted, refuting the
   hypothesis of priority effect driving the community assembly.},

Abstract = {Plantations of native-tree species are often recommended for ecological
   restoration, but the understanding of how these techniques catalyze
   natural ecological processes is limited. We investigated natural
   regeneration in five plantations of native trees in the Poco das Antas
   Biological Reserve (PABR) in the state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The
   plantations were 9-11 years old, and contained 8-14 native-tree species
   with different compositions and relative density of species. We analyzed
   floristic composition, structure (density and basal area) of overstory
   and understory strata, as well as other ecological attributes (dispersal
   syndromes, fruit or seed size, and the availability of fruit for
   frugivores). Zoochorous species comprised 77\% of the community, with a
   prevalence of the two smallest size classes of propagules (< 0.6 and
   0.6-1.6 cm) in natural regeneration. The density of zoochorous plants in
   the understory was positively correlated with their density in the
   overstory, indicating their influence on natural regeneration (r2 =
   0.36; p < 0.0002). Fruit availability for frugivores (density and
   richness of plants fruiting during the year) was also positively
   correlated with the density of stems in the understory. Therefore,
   attributes such as dispersal syndrome and fruiting season should be
   considered in selecting species to be planted. The differences in
   natural regeneration observed in each of the native-tree plantations
   indicated that the performance of plantations as a restoration strategy
   may differ, depending on initial species composition, planting density,
   and site conditions.},

   regeneration gradient in a seasonally dry tropical forest},
Journal = {ACTA OECOLOGICA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {123},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {The capability of plants to modify phenotypic characteristics through
   interactions with the environment can contribute to functional
   stability, particularly when this plasticity influences traits
   associated with survival, rendering it a pivotal mechanism for
   adaptation. Grime's CSR theory is employed to classify plants based on
   functional traits dictating competitive, stress, and ruderal tolerance
   strategies, as these traits serve as indicators of plant responses to
   environmental stimuli. This study examines the variation in plant
   functional traits (morphophysiological and phytochemical) within
   herbaceous communities across a chronosequence of natural regeneration
   after land-use alteration and abandonment. We investigate whether a
   correlation exists between regeneration duration and community-weighted
   mean values through principal component analysis and canonical
   correspondence analysis. Intraspecific variability of traits is assessed
   using one-way ANOVA and Tukey's post-hoc test at a significance level of
   5\% for mean comparisons. Generally, with progressing regeneration,
   intraspecific differences emerge, including elevated carbon:nitrogen
   ratio, phenolic compounds, and carbon assimilation, alongside reductions
   in leaf area, plant height, leaf succulence, individual biomass, and
   leaf nitrogen content. Consequently, pasture and initial regeneration
   communities harbor species with functional traits akin to ruderal
   species, whereas species inhabiting later stages exhibit traits
   associated with competitors. Analysis of intraspecific variation
   demonstrates that species occupying sites at different regeneration
   stages exhibit phenotypic plasticity. The findings underscore how
   alterations in environmental conditions during natural regeneration
   influence functional trait values, and underscore the utility of CSR
   theory for quantifying, comparing, and predicting community structure
   based on adaptive plant strategies.},

Title = {The role of land-use history in driving successional pathways and its
   implications for the restoration of tropical forests},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL REVIEWS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {96},
Number = {4},
Pages = {1114-1134},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Secondary forests are increasingly important components of
   human-modified landscapes in the tropics. Successional pathways,
   however, can vary enormously across and within landscapes, with
   divergent regrowth rates, vegetation structure and species composition.
   While climatic and edaphic conditions drive variations across regions,
   land-use history plays a central role in driving alternative
   successional pathways within human-modified landscapes. How land use
   affects succession depends on its intensity, spatial extent, frequency,
   duration and management practices, and is mediated by a complex
   combination of mechanisms acting on different ecosystem components and
   at different spatial and temporal scales. We review the literature
   aiming to provide a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms
   underlying the long-lasting effects of land use on tropical forest
   succession and to discuss its implications for forest restoration. We
   organize it following a framework based on the hierarchical model of
   succession and ecological filtering theory. This review shows that our
   knowledge is mostly derived from studies in Neotropical forests
   regenerating after abandonment of shifting cultivation or pasture
   systems. Vegetation is the ecological component assessed most often.
   Little is known regarding how the recovery of belowground processes and
   microbiota communities is affected by previous land-use history. In
   published studies, land-use history has been mostly characterized by
   type, without discrimination of intensity, extent, duration or
   frequency. We compile and discuss the metrics used to describe land-use
   history, aiming to facilitate future studies. The literature shows that
   (i) species availability to succession is affected by transformations in
   the landscape that affect dispersal, and by management practices and
   seed predation, which affect the composition and diversity of propagules
   on site. Once a species successfully reaches an abandoned field, its
   establishment and performance are dependent on resistance to management
   practices, tolerance to (modified) soil conditions, herbivory,
   competition with weeds and invasive species, and facilitation by remnant
   trees. (ii) Structural and compositional divergences at early stages of
   succession remain for decades, suggesting that early communities play an
   important role in governing further ecosystem functioning and processes
   during succession. Management interventions at early stages could help
   enhance recovery rates and manipulate successional pathways. (iii) The
   combination of local and landscape conditions defines the limitations to
   succession and therefore the potential for natural regeneration to
   restore ecosystem properties effectively. The knowledge summarized here
   could enable the identification of conditions in which natural
   regeneration could efficiently promote forest restoration, and where
   specific management practices are required to foster succession.
   Finally, characterization of the landscape context and previous land-use
   history is essential to understand the limitations to succession and
   therefore to define cost-effective restoration strategies. Advancing
   knowledge on these two aspects is key for finding generalizable
   relations that will increase the predictability of succession and the
   efficiency of forest restoration under different landscape contexts.},

Abstract = {The dynamics of the natural process of recuperation of the structure and
   diversity of native vegetation following anthropogenic disturbance has
   been the subject of a great deal of controversy in restoration ecology
   research. The present study evaluates the natural regeneration of
   savanna forest (cerradao) 32 and 36 years after the clear-cutting of the
   vegetation. We compared species diversity, and the structure and
   dynamics of the vegetation in two communities, one representing
   preserved cerradao (PC), and the other, the regenerating cerradao (RC),
   which was clear-cut in 1976. Surveys were conducted in 2008 and 2012, 32
   and 36 years after clear-cutting, respectively. In 2008, we demarcated
   81 permanent 10 m x 10 m plots, 50 in the RC and 31 in the PC, and
   measured all live plants with a diameter at soil level >= 5 cm. In 2012,
   the plots were resampled, including the original plants and all the
   recruits. The species were classified as specialists in savanna (SA) or
   forest habitat (FO), or as generalists (SA/FO). The RC presented the
   highest species richness and diversity, density, annual increment, and
   mortality rates. However, no significant differences were found between
   communities in the distribution of specialist or generalist species, or
   between years (2008 and 2012) in basal area or recruitment rates. While
   the species composition of the two communities is highly similar, the RC
   was characterized by a higher frequency of SA species, and was more
   similar to nearby savanna communities (cerrado sensu stricto). Trees in
   the RC were smaller and suffered higher rates of mortality than those in
   the PC, but also higher annual increments. While the RC demonstrated a
   high degree of resilience following clear-cutting, it was still found to
   be at an intermediate stage of succession, even after almost four
   decades, indicating that regeneration is a slow process.},

Abstract = {This study provides an approximation of the potential impact of fuelwood
   harvesting in one of the most threatened tropical biodiversity
   conservation hotspots, the northern portion of the Brazilian Atlantic
   Forest. We test the relationship between fuelwood consumption and per
   capita income for 270 households distributed over 7 rural settlements.
   In general 76\% of the households use fuelwood regularly and consume on
   average 686 kg/person/year of tree biomass, poorer people, however,
   consume 961 kg/person/year. Harvesting is concentrated to a few early
   successional species. Yet, annual rural population demand from 210
   municipalities may reach 303,793 tons, equivalent to 1.2 to 2.1 thousand
   hectares of tropical forest. Fuelwood harvesting cannot be ignored as a
   major and chronic source of forest degradation in highly fragmented and
   densely populated landscapes and conciliating biodiversity conservation
   with poverty amelioration is an urgent task. (C) 2014 The Authors.

Journal = {SCIENCE ADVANCES},
Year = {2017},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Is active restoration the best approach to achieve ecological
   restoration success (the return to a reference condition, that is,
   old-growth forest) when compared to natural regeneration in tropical
   forests? Ourmeta-analysis of 133 studies demonstrated that natural
   regeneration surpasses active restoration in achieving tropical forest
   restoration success for all three biodiversity groups (plants, birds,
   and invertebrates) and five measures of vegetation structure (cover,
   density, litter, biomass, and height) tested. Restoration success for
   biodiversity and vegetation structure was 34 to 56\% and 19 to 56\%
   higher in natural regeneration than in active restoration systems,
   respectively, after controlling for key biotic and abiotic factors
   (forest cover, precipitation, time elapsed since restoration started,
   and past disturbance). Biodiversity responses were based primarily on
   ecological metrics of abundance and species richness (74\%), both of
   which take far less time to achieve restoration success than similarity
   and composition. This finding challenges the widely held notion that
   natural forest regeneration has limited conservation value and that
   active restoration should be the default ecological restoration
   strategy. The proposition that active restoration achieves greater
   restoration success than natural regeneration may have arisen because
   previous comparisons lacked controls for biotic and abiotic factors; we
   also did not find any difference between active restoration and natural
   regeneration outcomes for vegetation structure when we did not control
   for these factors. Future policy priorities should align the identified
   patterns of biophysical and ecological conditions where each or both
   restoration approaches are more successful, cost-effective, and
   compatible with socioeconomic incentives for tropical forest

Title = {Succession and seasonality of a Brazilian secondary tropical dry forest:
   Phenology and climate moderation},
Journal = {FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {568},

Abstract = {With large tracts of Tropical Dry Forests (TDF) in the Americas
   previously deforested, many places are currently undergoing secondary
   ecological succession. These processes vary in time and space, creating
   a landscape with forests of different ages or successional stages. These
   secondary forests need moreneed more understanding about how their
   ecosystem functionality is restored and recovering along the succession
   path. In particular, it is poorly understood how different successional
   stages moderate extremes of Essential Climatic Variables (ECV) such as
   temperature, relative humidity, soil moisture, and the fraction of
   Absorbed Photosynthetic Active Radiation (fAPAR). This paper, therefore,
   studies the linkages between high temporal resolution tower-based
   optical canopy phenology time series and seasonal changes in local ECV
   conditions between early (10-12 years) and late (50+ years) successional
   stage TDF in southeastern Brazil. We compare diurnal and seasonal
   patterns of understory ECVs between early/late plots and investigate the
   canopy's Climate Moderating Capacity (CMC). Our data indicate at least
   100 mm of precipitation within two weeks is necessary to initiate leaf
   flushing in this TDF. We also find that soil moisture and daytime air
   humidity strongly correlate (R2 > 0.75) with seasonal patterns in canopy
   vegetation greenness indices and fAPAR with a cross-correlation time lag
   peak of 12-15 days. Our results suggest that the late stage is more
   effective at cooling (-1.4 +/- 0.6 degrees C vs -0.8 +/- 0.6 degrees C)
   and reducing daytime evaporation (-0.41 +/- 0.2 kPa vs -0.18 +/- 0.12
   degrees C) in the understory during the growing season than the early
   stage. Results suggest that the CMC varies with seasonal canopy leaf
   area dynamics and with heat and moisture scales, becoming significantly
   stronger when temperatures and vapour pressure deficits were highest,
   and correlated strongly with canopy fAPAR dynamics (R2 = 0.82). These
   findings demonstrate that TDFs can effectively regain microclimatic
   buffering capacity.},

Abstract = {Traditional Amazonian farmers (caboclos) along the Xingu River near
   Altamira, Parl, Brazil, practice shifting cultivation using fallow
   periods (periods during which cultivated areas are temporarily abandoned
   and invaded by secondary forest) which they consider necessary to
   restore soil nutrients and control weeds and insect pests. At the end of
   the growing season, maize production was measured in the farmers' fields
   in randomly selected 9-m(2) quadrats. Yield was significantly higher in
   agricultural plots derived from secondary forest (n = 11) than from old
   growth ('virgin') forest (n = 11). Yield on plots derived from mature
   secondary forest (11-30 yr old; n = 4) was also significantly higher
   than that on plots derived from young secondary forest (3-10 yr old; n =
   7) and `virgin' forest, A significant positive relationship was
   encountered between length of fallow period and maize yield over the
   range of fallow ages studied (3-30 yr). (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.},

Abstract = {High-resolution image segmentation and data mining techniques were used
   in order to find statistical correlation between spatial, spectral,
   context and texture attributes, considering field data from early stages
   of secondary forests in the three study sites of Rain Forest in Santa
   Catarina State, Brazil. Field data were collected in six sampling plots
   with 1,600 m(2) each. Digital processing utilized three high resolution
   images (0.39 m) obtained by SAAPI sensor with three visible bands, three
   near infrared bands, one terrain and one surface model. Extracted data
   from the digital product (attributes) were used for data mining
   purposes, selecting the ones with relevance and dismissing those of
   lesser weight. It was found that both tree and regeneration layers are
   heterogeneous considering number of individuals (N), diameter at breast
   height (DBH) and basal area (AB). However, significant correlations
   between forest attributes and field data were found. The higher
   correlation of N is with the average of the band 1 (-0.64), 3 (-0.62)
   and IR1 (0.63) for DBH was the ratio of bands IR3 (0.56) and 2 (0.55)
   and the variable AB was the smallest pixel value of band 1 (-0.64) and
   IR3 (-0.60). All correlation coefficients were highly significant (p <
   0.01). These results constitute the starting point for future research
   on the relationship between groups of variables in order to estimate
   biophysical parameters.},

Abstract = {In environments with water and nutrient constraints, some early
   successional shrub/tree species may promote facilitation by ameliorating
   the microclimate and increasing resource availability. We ask whether
   early successional semi-arid shrub/tree species have facilitation
   effects for other woody species and if they do, which mechanisms are
   involved and how they affect the water status of juvenile plants. Three
   early successional woody species; Combretum leprosum, Cenostigma
   bracteosum and Mimosa tenuiflora, were chosen for investigation. The
   richness of regenerating woody species and their leaf water potential
   were used as response variables, while air and soil temperature, leaf
   area index, humidity and soil attributes were used as explanatory
   environmental variables. Species growing under the canopy of C. leprosum
   had better water status and growth at higher soil moisture and lower
   thermal and solar radiation stress, receiving a facilitative effect. The
   lower leaf area index, higher radiation and more negative soil water
   content under the canopy of C. bracteosum in comparison to C. leprosum
   may have a small negative effect on species richness. M. tenuiflora did
   not reduce environmental stress, and the species associated with it had
   low water potential, thus no increase in species richness was detected
   under its canopy. C. leprosum and C. bracteosum improve the
   environmental conditions under their canopies and provide favourable
   microsites for the establishment of other species. The positive effects
   may be generated by functional traits that modify microclimatic
   characteristics under the nurse species' canopy and lead to a higher
   water status of the juveniles growing under it.},

Abstract = {To better understand the role of seed banks in ecological succession of
   dry forests, we compared similarities between vegetation and seed banks
   and assessed the relative contributions of seed dispersal and
   persistence in chronosequences in the Brazilian semi-arid region. To
   sample the standing vegetation and the seed bank, we collected data in
   three sites with three successional ages in each one (5 y, 25 y and 45
   y). A total of 180 soil samples (three sites x three successional ages x
   10 plots x two components) were collected. The composition of the seed
   bank was assessed by the seedling emergence method. Of 166 species
   identified in the standing vegetation, only 50 (30.1\%) were also
   present in the seed bank, resulting in low similarity (Jaccard index =
   0.02-0.21) and reflecting the rarity of woody species and the dominance
   of annuals (71\% of richness). The relative importance of seed
   persistence and seed dispersal to seed banks composition were balanced
   in most cases (difference was not rejected in four out six comparisons).
   Those results suggest that seed banks in tropical dry forests are
   largely the result of high dispersal rates and the persistence of
   allochthonous annual species that contribute to decoupling seed bank and
   vegetation composition.},

Title = {Strong floristic distinctiveness across Neotropical successional forests},
Journal = {SCIENCE ADVANCES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {8},
Number = {26},
Month = {JUL 1},
Abstract = {Forests that regrow naturally on abandoned fields are important for
   restoring biodiversity and ecosystem services, but can they also
   preserve the distinct regional tree floras? Using the floristic
   composition of 1215 early successional forests (<= 20 years) in 75
   human-modified landscapes across the Neotropic realm, we identified 14
   distinct floristic groups, with a between-group dissimilarity of 0.97.
   Floristic groups were associated with location, bioregions, soil pH,
   temperature seasonality, and water availability. Hence, there is large
   continental-scale variation in the species composition of early
   successional forests, which is mainly associated with biogeographic and
   environmental factors but not with human disturbance indicators. This
   floristic distinctiveness is partially driven by regionally restricted
   species belonging to widespread genera. Early secondary forests
   contribute therefore to restoring and conserving the distinctiveness of
   bioregions across the Neotropical realm, and forest restoration
   initiatives should use local species to assure that these distinct
   floras are maintained.},

Abstract = {This study aimed to inventory the tree regenerating component in a
   forest in Southern Plateau of Santa Catarina and compare it to the adult
   component of the same area. A total of 25 plots were allocated, where
   the regenerating and adults trees were identified and quantified. The
   Total Natural Regeneration Index (TNR) of each species was calculated.
   We used the analysis of similarities and the Jaccard index to verify the
   similarity between the components. A total of 503 regenerants belonging
   to 58 species and 29 families were sampled. Myrtaceae was the richest
   family (13). Leandra regnelli (Triana) Cogn., Myrcia splendens (Sw.) DC.
   and Miconia cinerascens Miq. showed the highest values of TNR. There was
   elevated dissimilarity between the regenerative and adult component,
   with 37.5\% of the species adult component absent on natural
   regeneration. In conclusion, there is a low regenerative capacity of
   most species which may be associated with the presence of cattle in the
   area.},

Abstract = {Key message The allometric relationships of tropical trees change along
   ontogeny and ecological succession at the level of populations and
   communities. Tree size and shape can influence their survival and
   growth, affecting the community dynamics. In this study, we explored how
   the tree allometric relationship is altered along in the succession of a
   tropical forest. We measure stem diameter (SD), total height (H), crown
   volume (CV) of juvenile, and adult trees in areas of 7-17, 20-30, 35-55,
   and > 80 years of Atlantic Forest in Brazil. The study was carried out
   for the community (all individuals were considered) and population (the
   most abundant species). We tested allometric relationships between H, SD
   and CV with the standardized major axis function. The results indicate
   that, in general, successional gradient establishes conditions that
   affect the way resources are invested in trees, despite variations among
   the type of allometric relationship, the ontogenetic phase, the
   successional stage and species considered. There are tendencies in
   individuals becoming taller, and proportionally, with crowns less
   voluminous along the succession. Variations in height, stem diameter and
   crown investment along the successional gradient suggest that shade
   tolerance is the main driver affecting the ontogenetic niche and shaping
   tree allometry. These results suggest that the successional age and the
   ontogeny of the individuals affect plant dynamics, and possibly, the
   coexistence of the species.},

Abstract = {Understanding the regeneration process in an old growth forest is
   essential for restoration projects. The present research sought to
   characterize the floristic and structural composition of shrub-tree
   species in Sao Francisco de Assis Municipal Park in Blumenau-SC. We
   sampled 50 permanent plots divided into three height classes. We
   estimated the total natural regeneration index for each species, the
   Shannon-Wiener diversity index and Pielou equability, and classified the
   species according to life-form and ecological group. A total of 1048
   individuals were found, distributed in 112 species, 69 genera and 37
   families. The species with the highest values of total natural
   regeneration index were Rudgea recurva, R. jasminoides, Ouratea
   parviflora, Psychotria nuda and Virola bicuhyba. The Shannon and Pielou
   indices demonstrated high diversity and equability for the natural
   regeneration area sampled. The results indicate species possibly capable
   of reaching the tree strata, and also indicate high forest conservation.},

Abstract = {This study investigated the development of biological soil crusts
   (biocrusts) in an early successional subtropical forest plantation and
   their impact on soil erosion. Within a biodiversity and ecosystem
   functioning experiment in southeast China (biodiversity and ecosystem
   functioning (BEF) China), the effect of these biocrusts on sediment
   delivery and runoff was assessed within micro-scale runoff plots under
   natural rainfall, and biocrust cover was surveyed over a 5-year period.
   Results showed that biocrusts occurred widely in the experimental forest
   ecosystem and developed from initial light cyanobacteria-and
   algae-dominated crusts to later-stage bryophyte-dominated crusts within
   only 3 years. Biocrust cover was still increasing after 6 years of tree
   growth. Within later-stage crusts, 25 bryophyte species were determined.
   Surrounding vegetation cover and terrain attributes significantly
   influenced the development of biocrusts. Besides high crown cover and
   leaf area index, the development of biocrusts was favoured by low slope
   gradients, slope orientations towards the incident sunlight and the
   altitude of the research plots. Measurements showed that
   bryophyte-dominated biocrusts strongly decreased soil erosion, being
   more effective than abiotic soil surface cover. Hence, their significant
   role in mitigating sediment delivery and runoff generation in mesic
   forest environments and their ability to quickly colonise soil surfaces
   after disturbance are of particular interest for soil erosion control in
   early-stage forest plantations.},

Abstract = {Forest regeneration can affect the soil-dwelling insect fauna by
   promoting an increase in tree diversity and accelerating the
   accumulation of litter biomass in this environment. This study evaluated
   the effect of forest regeneration of Atlantic Forest fragments on the
   fungus-feeding thrips community. In each fragment, two treatments were
   selected: (i) intermediate successional stage (ISS) and (ii) early
   successional stage (ESS). Each treatment had three transects, each one
   with 10 sampling units, comprising 240 sampling units. We sampled 221
   adult thrips, 135 individuals in the ISS, and 86 individuals in the ESS.
   We found 35 Thysanoptera species in 15 genera, all of them belonging to
   Phlaeothripidae. Abundance, richness, and Shannon's diversity were
   higher in the ISS than in the ESS. The low number of individuals and
   high species richness suggests a remarkable distribution of thrips fauna
   in the litter. Although some taxa were more related to ISS, species
   composition structure did not differ between successional stages. Our
   study indicates that the fungivorous thrips fauna associated with litter
   was affected by the different natural regeneration states, suggesting
   that these fungivorous insects are sensitive to different successional
   stages.},

Abstract = {Some Eucalyptus species are widely used as a plantation crop in tropical
   and subtropical regions. One reason for this is the diversity of end
   uses, but the main reason is the high level of wood production obtained
   from commercial plantings. With the advancement of biotechnology it will
   be possible to expand the geographical area in which eucalypts can be
   used as commercial plantation crops, especially in regions with current
   climatic restrictions. Despite the popularity of eucalypts and their
   increasing range, questions still exist, in both traditional planting
   areas and in the new regions: Can eucalypts invade areas of native
   vegetation, causing damage to natural ecosystems biodiversity?
   The objective of this study it was to assess whether eucalypts can
   invade native vegetation fragments in proximity to commercial stands,
   and what factors promote this invasive growth. Thus, three experiments
   were established in forest fragments located in three different regions
   of Brazil. Each experiment was composed of 40 plots (1 m(2) each one),
   20 plots located at the border between the forest fragment and eucalypts
   plantation, and 20 plots in the interior of the forest fragments. In
   each experimental site, the plots were paired by two soil exposure
   conditions, 10 plots in natural conditions and 10 plots with soil
   exposure (no plant and no litter). During the rainy season, 2 g of
   eucalypts seeds were sown in each plot, including Eucalyptus grandis or
   a hybrid of E. urophylla x E. grandis, the most common commercial
   eucalypt species planted in the three region. At 15, 30, 45, 90, 180,
   270 and 360 days after sowing, we assessed the number of seedlings of
   eucalypts and the number of seedlings of native species resulting from
   natural regeneration. Fifteen days after sowing, the greatest number of
   eucalypts seedlings (37 m(-2)) was observed in the plots with lower
   luminosity and exposed soil. Also, for native species, it was observed
   that exposed soil improved natural germination reaching the highest
   number of 163 seedlings per square meter. Site and soil exposure were
   the factors that have the greatest influence on seed germination of both
   eucalypt and native species. However, 270 days after sowing, eucalypt
   seedlings were not observed at any of the three experimental sites. The
   result shows the inability of eucalypts to adapt to condition outside of
   their natural range. However, native species demonstrated their strong
   capacity for natural regeneration in forest fragments under the same
   conditions where eucalypts were seeded. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {Semideciduous Seasonal Forest is a phytophysiognomy of Atlantic Forest
   with high plant richness but low representativeness in few remnants
   areas in different successional stages. The assessment of the degree of
   conservation of those areas helps to indicate whether there is a need
   for taking strategies to favor forest succession. Thus, the aim of this
   study was to identify litterfall and its nutrient content, accumulated
   litter biomass on topsoil, leaf litter decomposition, and topsoil (0-10
   cm) chemical attributes as possible indicators of successional stages in
   areas of Seasonally Semideciduous Forest. We collected available
   information in literature on CAPES Portal and Google Scholar (May/2021
   to February/2022) for Pinheiral municipality, State of Rio de Janeiro,
   Brazil, which were evaluated by multivariate analysis. Accumulated
   litter biomass, nutrient content (N, P, K) in total litterfall, pH and P
   availability in topsoil, leaf litter decomposition constant, and
   half-life time of leaf litter were the most sensitive attributes to
   indicate the successional stage in the study area, according to
   Principal Component Analysis. This multivariate analysis indicated that
   areas in early successional stage were associated with higher values of
   leaves contribution, half-life of leaf litterfall, contents of Ca and K
   in total litterfall, whereas areas in middle successional stage were
   associated with higher values of pH, total organic carbon, exchangeable
   Ca2+, K+, and Mg+, sum of bases and cation exchange capacity, and lower
   values of extractable acidity and exchangeable Al3+ in the topsoil.
   Areas in advanced stages of succession were associated to higher values
   of total litterfall and its nutrient content (N, K, Mg), accumulated
   litter biomass, available P in topsoil, and leaf litter decomposition
   constant. The Cluster multivariate analysis revealed that the areas in
   advanced successional stage presented high dissimilarity in relation to
   the areas in early and middle successional stage.},

Abstract = {Restinga is an ecosystem associated mainly with the Atlantic Forest that
   can be defined as vegetation of the coastal plain established on sandy
   soil. This study was carried out in degraded areas of restinga in a
   Conservation Unit in Sao Joao da Barra, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. In 2012,
   a restoration project was initiated in the area, with implementation of
   plantings in hexagonal rings and artificial perches. Seedlings were
   planted in two contrasting situations: sandbanks (dry areas) and
   depression zones (areas prone to seasonal flooding). The objective of
   this study was to evaluate the performance of seedlings planted in both
   areas and accompany natural regeneration. We hypothesised that species
   planted and recruited in depressions should have better survival rates
   and increments in height (H) and diameter at the ground level (DGL) than
   the ones planted in sandbanks. Monitoring of planted seedlings was
   carried out in November 2016. Both communities had similar mortality (c.
   50\%). Greater increments in H were found for Inga laurina and Schinus
   terebinthifolia in depressions. Higher increments in DGL were observed
   especially for I. laurina, Inga vera and S. terebinthifolia with good
   performance in both areas. In general, seedlings planted in depressions
   showed greater performances, which can be related to higher water and
   nutrient availability. The most abundant natural regenerant species were
   Scoparia dulcis in sandbanks and S. terebinthifolia in depressions. A
   high number of regenerants was found associated with artificial perches,
   especially Cynophalla flexuosa, which demonstrates that the technique
   facilitated regeneration in the area.},

Abstract = {Birds are important hosts for various tick species, playing a
   significant role in their biological life cycle and dispersion. In this
   study, we investigated tick infestations on birds trapped in an urban
   remnant of Atlantic Forest in Pernambuco state, Brazil. From February
   2015 to March 2017, 541 birds belonging to 52 species were trapped with
   mist nets and examined for ectoparasites. Birds trapped in the late
   successional forest were significantly more infested than birds trapped
   in the early successional forest. In the same way, ectoparasite
   infestation varied significantly according to bird weight and collection
   plot. Overall, 198 birds (36.6\%) belonging to 27 species were
   parasitized by ectoparasites (i.e., ticks, lice and/or mites).
   Ectoparasites were effectively collected from 111 birds, of which 99
   belonging to 20 species were infested by ticks (n = 261), namely,
   Amblyomma longirostre (13 nymphs), Amblyomma nodosum (21 nymphs),
   Amblyomma varium (one nymph), and Amblyomma spp. (five nymphs and 221
   larvae). Most of the ticks (> 90\%) were collected from Passeriformes.
   This study provides the second record of A. varium in Pernambuco state
   and confirms that birds, especially Passeriformes, are important hosts
   for larvae and nymphs of Amblyomma spp. in the Atlantic Forest biome of
   Pernambuco.},

Abstract = {Forest restoration requires strategies such as passive restoration to
   balance financial investments and ecological outcomes. However, the
   ecological outcomes of passive restoration are traditionally regarded as
   uncertain. We evaluated technical and legal strategies for balancing
   economic costs and ecological outcomes of passive versus active
   restoration in agricultural landscapes. We focused in the case of
   Brazil, where we assessed the factors driving the proportion of land
   allocated to passive and active restoration in 42 programs covering
   698,398 hectares of farms in the Atlantic Forest, Atlantic
   Forest/cerrado ecotone and Amazon; the ecological outcomes of passive
   and active restoration in 2955 monitoring plots placed in six
   restoration programs; and the legal framework developed by some
   Brazilian states to balance the different restoration approaches and
   comply with legal commitments. Active restoration had the highest
   proportion of land allocated to it (78.4\%), followed by passive
   (14.2\%) and mixed restoration (7.4\%). Passive restoration was higher
   in the Amazon, in silviculture, and when remaining forest cover was over
   50 percent. Overall, both restoration approaches showed high levels of
   variation in the ecological outcomes; nevertheless, passively restored
   areas had a smaller percentage canopy cover, lower species density, and
   less shrubs and trees (dbh > 5 cm). The studied legal frameworks
   considered land abandonment for up to 4 years before deciding on a
   restoration approach, to favor the use of passive restoration. A better
   understanding of the biophysical and socioeconomic features of areas
   targeted for restoration is needed to take a better advantage of their
   natural regeneration potential. Abstract in Portuguese is available with

Abstract = {We documented litter production and seed rain in fragments of

   Brazil: a late successional fragment (LF); an early successional
   fragment (EF); and a reforested late successional fragment (RLF). In
   each fragment, we established three permanent plots with four litter
   traps each, corresponding to 12 litter traps per fragment. Botanical
   material was collected monthly between June 2011 and May 2012. We sorted
   the material by category: leaves; branches; reproductive structures; and
   miscellaneous. We analyzed the seed rain using the reproductive
   structures. Annual production was highest (11,560 kg.ha(-1)) in the LF,
   followed by the RLF, with 9330 kg.ha(-1), and the EF, with 7838
   kg.ha(-1). The RLF yielded 7167 diaspores, from 33 species, compared
   with 4751 diaspores, from 38 species, for the EF; in both fragments,
   pioneer and anemochorous species predominated. The LF yielded 2173
   diaspores, from 49 species, among which late secondary and climax
   species with zoochorous dispersal predominated. We observed asynchrony
   in the frequency of diaspore production of trees and lianas. Our data
   describe the dynamics of plant assemblages in SDF fragments and provide
   information on successional stages, dispersion syndromes, patterns of
   asynchrony, deciduousness, reproductive periods, and resource

Abstract = {In this study we compare the richness, abundance and guild composition
   between two different reforestations in the meridional part of the
   Amazon. We test the hypothesis that the termite community is affected by
   the identity of the tree species used in reforestation. More precisely,
   we test whether the reforestation of a native species of fig (Ficus sp)
   is more efficient in restoring biodiversity than reforestation of exotic
   teak trees (Tectona grandis). We sampled the termite community in these
   reforested areas and three other different ``control{''} areas: active
   pastures, abandoned pastures (secondary forests) and mature pristine
   forest. We found that the distance of reforestation from the nearest
   primary forest had no effect on termite biodiversity, at the scale
   studied. But, as expected, richness and the abundance were higher in the
   mature forest, intermediate in reforestation areas, and lower in
   secondary forest and pastures. In fact, the only studied habitat with
   biodiversity comparable to the mature forest was the fig plantations.
   The guild composition in reforested areas was also similar to that of
   the mature forest. The diversity and abundance of humivorous termites
   was particularly pronounced in the reforestation areas compared with
   pasture or secondary forests. The humivorous guild provides important
   functional services, since its action makes nitrogen and other nutrients
   available to the plants along ecological succession. Our results show
   that reforestation is a valuable strategy in restoring termite diversity
   and recovering the ecosystem services they provide.},

Abstract = {Extensive forest restoration is a key strategy to meet nature-based
   sustainable development goals and provide multiple social and
   environmental benefits1. Yet achieving forest restoration at scale
   requires cost-effective methods2. Tree planting in degraded landscapes
   is a popular but costly forest restoration method that often results in
   less biodiverse forests when compared to natural regeneration techniques
   under similar conditions3. Here we assess the current spatial
   distribution of pantropical natural forest (from 2000 to 2016) and use
   this to present a model of the potential for natural regeneration across
   tropical forested countries and biomes at a spatial resolution of 30 m.
   We estimate that an area of 215 million hectares-an area greater than
   the entire country of Mexico-has potential for natural forest
   regeneration, representing an above-ground carbon sequestration
   potential of 23.4 Gt C (range, 21.1-25.7 Gt) over 30 years. Five
   countries (Brazil, Indonesia, China, Mexico and Colombia) account for
   52\% of this estimated potential, showcasing the need for targeting
   restoration initiatives that leverage natural regeneration potential.
   Our results facilitate broader equitable decision-making processes that
   capitalize on the widespread opportunity for natural regeneration to
   help achieve national and global environmental agendas.},

Abstract = {Most of the northeastern territory of Brazil is occupied by scrub, which
   is characterized by xerophytic vegetation, different vegetation types
   and a biome considered more sensitive to human interference and climate.
   This study aimed to characterize the floristic composition and structure
   of a fragment savanna located in Chapada Moura region, at Farm Elmo
   Moreno Iguatu, Ceara state. Forty-five (45) plots of 10x20 m were
   established and all individuals with diameter >= 3 cm and height >= 1 m
   were measured. Two thousand and two hundred fifty-six (2256) individuals
   ha(-1), representing 36 species, 29 genera and 13 families were
   observed. Species diversity was low compared to other vegetation types
   with Shannon Index of 1.59. Croton sonderianus and Combretum leprosum
   were the species with the highest DoR, DR, F, IVC and IVI followed
   Pityrocarpa moniliformis. The presence of a large number of unique and
   rare woody species shows that the work done so far has not yet sampled
   the diversity of species present in the different regions of the Biome.
   This 70-year preserved area is still in early stages of ecological
   succession evidenced by low species richness and greater occurrence of
   species of the genus Croton.},

Abstract = {Natural regeneration may be a cost-effective method for recovering areas
   previously used for intensive agricultural purposes. Plant diversity in
   the succession periods has been well documented; however, less attention
   has been paid to the changes in soil attributes, which may work as an
   instrument for the validation of regeneration methods. The present study
   is part of a broader interdisciplinary research project assessing the
   effects of natural regeneration on biodiversity and the quality of the
   soil. We investigated the effects of natural regeneration on the
   physicochemical attributes of the soil, as well as on soil organic
   carbon (SOC), microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and enzyme attributes. We
   assessed three stages and five areas of each natural regeneration stage
   (early-ER, intermediate-IR and late-LR) in two layers: 0-5 and 5-10 cm.
   The present study found a 20\% SOC increase due to natural regeneration.
   In the first layer, SOC, urease, acid phosphatase and arylsulfatase
   absolute activities were significantly higher in the two older natural
   regeneration stages (IR and LR) than those found in the ER stage. We
   found a reduction in specific enzyme activities per SOC unit in the ER
   areas. Natural regeneration influenced SOC and MBC, the absolute enzyme
   activities, and the specific enzymes per SOC unit, mainly in the surface
   layer. The present study provided some of the first data concerning the
   beneficial effects of natural regeneration on the quality of soil as
   measured through enzyme activity, SOC and MBC in a tropical dry region
   in Northeastern Brazil. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The natural regeneration process is essential for forest maintenance
   since it is critical for establishing new tree individuals. This study
   aimed to improve the understanding of the regenerative component
   dynamics of Araucaria Forests in Southern Brazil. We investigated the
   effects of climate, light, tree component structure and anthropogenic
   disturbance on tree species regeneration. Regenerating communities from
   six different fragments in forest remnants of the ``Planalto Sul
   Catarinense{''} region was evaluated in permanent plots two years after
   the first inventory. The following demographic rates were determined:
   recruitment, mortality, net change in the number of individuals and the
   changes to both upper and lower height classes. The following variables
   were measured in each fragment: altitude, climatic variables, light
   environment, tree component density and cattle presence. Association
   between dynamics rates, regenerating species abundance and explanatory
   variables was verified by the fourth-corner and RLQ methods. A total of
   4,379 and 5,268 individuals were sampled for the first and second
   inventories, respectively, with recruitment rate (21 \% yr(-1)) higher
   than mortality rate (13 \% yr(-1)). The dynamics pattern of the fragment
   with greater presence of cattle stood out for the intense height
   increase of regenerating species caused by the presence of fast growth
   and light-demanding species. Natural regeneration of forest remnants
   under study is facing a structuring process. The main conclusions of
   this study were: i) climate and altitude play a relevant role in
   defining floristic identity and ii) chronic disturbances may influence
   the definition of ecological strategies.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY},
Year = {2001},
Volume = {89},
Number = {4},
Pages = {528-537},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {1 Successional pathways were evaluated in two Amazonian secondary forest
   communities with different land-use histories. Sites which had been
   clearcut without subsequent use were dominated after 6-10 years by the
   pioneer genus Cecropia (Moraceae), whereas those used for pasture before
   abandonment were dominated by the pioneer genus Vismia (Clusiaceae).
   2 There were 58 plant families and 300 species identified in Cecropia
   stands but only 43 families and 147 species were identified in Vismia
   stands. There were 77 species in common (Sorensen similarity = 0.34).
   3 Differences in species number and composition of recruiting
   individuals between stand types were significant and were a function of
   the dominant pioneer genus, stem density, distance from primary forest,
   and land-use history. Regeneration under Vismia canopy was dominated by
   small Vismia individuals (25\% of plants < 2 cm basal diameter), whereas
   regeneration under Cecropia canopy was more diverse and did not include
   a single young Cecropia.
   4 The number of regenerating plants in both secondary stand types
   dropped off sharply with distance (5, 25, 50, and 100 m) from primary
   forest, suggesting that seed dispersal was limiting plant recruitment.
   Species richness also declined with distance and could be explained by
   the decline in plant density. Species richness in Cecropia stands
   increased linearly with plant density, but in Vismia stands the richness
   increase with density was a decelerating function.
   5 For the central Amazon, secondary succession involves a more rapid
   return of primary forest species if deforestation is not followed by use
   as pasture before abandonment.},

   by Casearia sylvestris with 25.8\%. In the Border OMF Montana the
   species that succeeded Araucaria angustifolia (29.0\%) was Gochnatia
   polymorpha with 27.2\% of VC. The third strata, OMF Alluvial, presented
   as predominant species Schinus terebinthifolius (55,5\%), followed by
   Sebastiania commersoniana (27,7\%), both characteristics of alluvial

Abstract = {The relationships among floristic, structural and physiognomic variables
   of the tree component, flooding regime variations and soil fertility
   were investigated in a riparian forest fragment (ca. 43 ha) in the Rio
   Botucarai- watershed near the confluence with the Rio Jacui, southern
   Brazil. All the trees with a dbh >= 15 cm were surveyed in 100
   contiguous 10 x 10 m plots and soil chemical and textural variables were
   obtained from the analyses of 15 topsoil samples (0-20 cm depth)
   collected at different locations. The sample sites encompass all the
   topographic variation of the area. We used canonical correspondence
   analysis (CCA) to seek correlations between environmental variables and
   tree component distribution. The 1,547 surveyed individuals belonged to
   30 species and 16 botanical families. The Shannon diversity index (H')
   and the Pielou equability (J') were 1.995 and 0.586 nats ind.(-1),
   respectively. Sebastiania commersoniana, Casearia sylvestris, Eugenia
   uniflora and Eugenia hyemalis presented the highest importance values.
   Species' densities chiefly correlated with site elevation, flooding
   regime and soil chemical fertility. The analyses of ecological
   categories (EC) revealed that most species are heliophylous and typical
   of early successional stages. Richness and diversity (P < 0.001)
   variations from different topographic positions reflect that at the
   local scale, flooding was a limiting factor for the establishment of
   certain species suggesting that local processes control species richness

Year = {2000},
Volume = {25},
Number = {4},
Pages = {198-202},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Conversion of tropical forests into pastures and agriculture have
   serious impacts on carbon allocation in ecosystems and releases carbon
   to the atmosphere, mainly as CO2 and CH4. The abandonment of these land
   uses typically results in secondary forest growth which can serve as a a
   sink for carbon. To determine the relative importance of this sink for
   the western portion of Brazil's arc of deforestation in Acre State, we
   measured the aboveground biomass of six secondary forests (51 to 136
   Mg/ha) with ages ranging from 6 to 35 years. Based on a negative
   exponential model, the biomass accumulation into secondary forests in
   Acre is approximately 6.2{*} e(-0.025t) Mg ha(-1) yr(-1), of which
   approximately 50 percent is carbon. This simple model underestimates
   rates during the first ten years, but demonstrates the decreasing rate
   of carbon uptake with time, consistent with the classical pattern of
   secondary succession where slower growing tree species replace fast
   growing pioneer species. The time necessary to achieve half of primary
   forest biomass is about 30 years. Recent estimates of deforestation of
   Acre range between 40,000 and 50,000 ha yr(-1). For secondary forests to
   compensate for the carbon loss from deforestation, 80,000 to 100,000 ha
   would need to be abandoned each year and left to accumulate carbon for
   30 years. Pilot studies indicate that secondary forests are not
   increasing but rather decreasing in area in Acre. Consequently,
   secondary forests in Acre are insignificant sinks of carbon at present.},

Abstract = {The objective of this study was to characterize the seed bank in the
   soil of different successional stages of Seasonal Semideciduous Forest
   and abandoned pasture in order to understand the natural regeneration
   potential of these areas. At each successional stage, 30 samples of soil
   were collected in the rainy and dry seasons to evaluate the qualitative
   heterogeneity of the forest, at the regeneration stage (FEA) forest,
   intermediate regeneration stage forest (ISF) and pasture (PAS). The
   species were classified according to the life form, successional group
   and dispersion syndrome. The number of individuals germinated was
   significantly higher (p < 0.001) in the ISF and in the rainy season
   (15,949 individuals). Richness was higher in the pasture area ( 79
   species), with a significant difference only between the environments.
   Most species are herbaceous (49.5\%), pioneers (76.5\%) and zoocory was
   the main dispersion syndrome (49\% of species). The results show that
   seed bank in the fragment of the regeneration advanced stage forest
   presents the highest resilience potential, since it is formed by
   different life forms and, mainly, by early and late secondary species.},

   richness by natural establishment was quantified. Syndromes of propagule
   dispersion and regeneration guilds were determined. A total of 918
   individuals from 73 species were found; 48 (65.8\%) of them were species
   naturally established in the area. 71.2\% of the species were classified
   as zoochoric (71.2\%), and 54.8\% as light demanding for climax. After
   six years, the restoration process was characterized by a trend of
   richness increment and replacement of initial by late successional
   species, indicating the relevance of the natural regeneration mechanism.},

Abstract = {The soil seed bank was studied in a seasonal semideciduous forest, in
   the domain of the Atlantic Forest, Southeastern Brazil (20 45 Latitude
   South, 42 55 Longitude West and altitude of 689.7 m). A total of 120
   soil samples (20 x 15 cm and depth of 5 cm), without the litter layer,
   were taken at the end of the rainy season in ten sites differing in
   slope, aspect and topographic position. The soil samples were placed to
   germinate in trays under 11.5 and 60 \% shade. The germinated seeds were
   classified as graminoids, herbaceous-lianas, shrub and arboreal groups.
   A total of 3,416 seeds germinated, being 30.2 \% of graminoids, 29.2 \%
   herbaceous-lianas, 17.5 \% shrub and 23.1 \% arboreal individuals. The
   shrub-arboreal individuals were distributed into 17 families, 25 genus
   and 31 species. Melastomataceae, Cecropiaceae and Piperaceae accounted
   for 31.8 \%, 10.0 \% and 8.8 \%, respectively, of the total
   shrub-arboreal species germinated seeds, being Miconia cinnamomifolia
   and Leandra purpurascens the predominant species (59.3 \% of the total
   germinated seeds). Pioneer species accounted for 61.3 \% of the
   shrub-arboreal species and 88.5 \% of the germinated seeds. There were
   no late secondary species. The average number of germinated seeds from
   all life habit and sites studied accounted for 949 seeds/m(2). The
   number of shrub-arboreal species and germinated seeds differed
   significantly by the Kruskal-Wallis test (P <= 0.05) between sites. The
   dominance of pioneer species in the soil seed bank of the studied forest
   indicates that the buried seeds can be considered satisfactory for
   natural regeneration in treefall gaps and clearcut areas. Therefore, in
   order to maintain a continuous forest succession, when there is
   predominance of initial and late secondary species, the soil seed bank
   is not satisfactory. In this situation, the management of the seedlings
   stock is required to sustain the natural regeneration.},

Abstract = {Evidence of environmental impact on the Cerrado is characterised by the
   presence of large homogeneous pastures and agricultural areas, with the
   presence of very fragmented and scattered forest fragments. When these
   areas are abandoned due to low productivity, natural regeneration
   begins, which is influenced by environmental factors. The goal of the
   present study was to evaluate the forest cover temporal dynamics in
   anthropogenic areas and the influence of climate on natural regeneration
   in the Cerrado. The study site was an anthropogenic area that has been
   protected against the entrance of domestic animals and agriculture since
   2002. Environments were identified, and natural regeneration dynamics
   were analysed by the use of vegetation indices calculated from satellite
   images. Statistical analysis Non-parametric Mann-Kendall was used to
   check the trend of the rain and the Normalized Difference Vegetation
   Index, multivariate analysis to verify the correlations and groups
   between the years of occurrence of El Nino and La Nino and the values of
   Normalized Difference Index. Natural regeneration in the Cerrado
   increased over time and was positively correlated with rainfall
   incidence. The process of recovery of degraded areas by natural
   regeneration technique proved efficient in the Cerrado, however, natural
   regeneration is negatively influenced by the weather phenomenon El Nino.},

Title = {Phenotypic plasticity and ecophysiological strategies in a tropical dry

Journal = {FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {340},
Pages = {62-69},
Month = {MAR 15},
Abstract = {The plasticity of functional attributes is an important strategy for the
   acclimation and establishment of plants in areas that undergo natural
   regeneration. The irregular rainfall of the Brazilian tropical dry
   forest is an important environmental filter for the determination of the
   set of species that can successfully establish in different stages of
   the regeneration process and influences the plant acclimation responses
   to the environmental conditions at each stage of ecological succession.
   In order to test the hypothesis that pioneer plants which can establish
   themselves, at the same time, in areas at different stages of
   regeneration have high phenotypic plasticity, we investigated the
   endemic tree species Poincianella pyramidalis Tull., which can be found
   in all stages of the regeneration process in the Brazilian tropical dry
   forest. Three areas were selected at different successional stages
   (early, intermediate and late), and the functional attributes of water
   status, gas exchange, leaf nutrients, specific leaf area, leaf
   construction costs and payback time were assessed. In the three
   successional stages all individuals had similar age. Measurements were
   taken in April, for two consecutive years, a dry and a wet. The
   evaluated parameters in this study showed changes according to
   successional stage. The highest leaf water potential was found in the
   late stage in the rainy year and lowest in the dry year. This behavior
   may be related, in addition to soil water availability, to a stronger
   competition for resources in these areas. Gas exchange and nutrient use
   efficiency were higher in 2013 and in the late successional stage, which
   exhibited higher soil moisture, a lower vapor pressure deficit and
   higher nutrient mobilization. There were no differences in the
   construction cost per unit mass between the stages, but differences in
   specific leaf area led to changes in cost per area. The payback time was
   shorter in the wettest year. For the driest year, the late stage showed
   greater energy use efficiency. The results show that the P. pyramidalis'
   attributes varies according to the successional stage, showing
   phenotypic plasticity. However, the strongest differences are observed
   between years, demonstrating that water is the main factor that
   coordinates the functional changes that confers its ability to
   acclimatize. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Turnover-driven loss of forest-dependent species changes avian species
   richness, functional diversity, and community composition in Andean
   forest fragments},
Journal = {GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {32},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Andean forests, a hotspot of biodiversity, have suffered extensive
   fragmentation, yet we have little understanding of how this process has
   affected biodiversity. We surveyed bird communities across a gradient of
   fragment sizes (10-170 ha) and a continuous forest reference site in the
   Colombian Western Andes. Using a multi-species occupancy model to
   combine survey data from audio-visual transect surveys, mist netting,
   and playbacks for owls, we estimated alpha and beta taxonomic and
   functional diversity. We asked whether (1) habitat amount (patch size),
   edge effects, or selective logging affect bird occupancy and drive
   changes to diversity, (2) functional and taxonomic diversity respond
   similarly to fragmentation, and (3) compositional changes result from
   species turnover or nested species loss. Species richness declined with
   decreasing habitat amount, increasing edge density, and increasing
   disturbance through selective logging. These effects were driven by the
   loss of forest-dependent species, which were also area sensitive: 30
   such species were absent from fragments, even the largest ones (>150
   ha). Area-sensitive species were also edge sensitive and increased in
   occupancy in unlogged forest. We further found high beta diversity
   (0.78) driven by species turnover (85\% of dissimilarity) along the
   gradient. Despite extensive turnover to non-forest species within
   functional groups, functional trait richness and dispersion
   significantly declined with habitat amount. Small fragments may mimic
   the structure and composition of early-successional Andean forests,
   driving spatial turnover patterns favoring disturbance-adapted species
   at the expense of primary-forest specialists. Large forest reserves are
   therefore required to conserve forest-dependent Andean birds.},

Title = {Pure or mixed plantings equally enhance the recovery of the Atlantic
   forest},
Journal = {FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {484},
Month = {MAR 15},
Abstract = {Planting native trees in high diversity has been widely recommended to
   recover tropical forests to regain ecosystems that are taxonomically and
   functionally similar to the native forests. However, whether planting
   mixed stands would provide better results than planting pure stands
   remains to be demonstrated. Aiming to support seasonal tropical forest
   restoration in the highly fragmented landscape of the Atlantic Forest,
   Brazil, we compared the long-term (from 24 to 53 years) outcomes of pure
   and mixed plantings of native tree species with a broad spectrum of
   reference ecosystems (degraded, secondary, and old-growth forests). We
   aimed to verify if pure plantings would be as successful in fostering
   natural regeneration as mixed plantings and if they could potentially
   reach the attributes of native forests in the same region. We assessed
   forest structure (density, biomass, basal area), richness, and taxonomic
   and functional diversity. We separately analyzed the upper,
   intermediate, and lower layers of the tree community and assessed the
   abundance of ferns and climbers. Functional traits included seed
   dispersal and pollination syndromes, growth rate, seed mass, and
   specific leaf area. Contrary to our expectations, pure and mixed
   plantings did not differ in tree density, species richness, and
   functional diversity. Mixed plantings had higher basal area and biomass,
   surpassing the reference ecosystems and higher taxonomic diversity,
   whereas pure plantings had more ferns, climbers, and saplings
   regenerating in the under story. There was no difference for most of the
   functional traits between the forest types, except in seed mass, which
   was higher in mixed plantings. Zoochorous species were dominant in all
   forest types and size classes. In pure plantings, fast-growing species
   prevailed, whereas moderate and slow-growth species predominated in the
   other forest types. Pure plantings did not differ from the reference
   ecosystems, except in taxonomic diversity and richness when compared
   with the old-growth forests, which takes longer to be achieved. Our
   results indicate that the sparse remnants of forests are still effective
   sources of propagules to colonize the plantings - whether using a single
   species or a mix - even in a highly fragmented landscape, which was the
   case in our study. In general, pure plantings were as effective as mixed
   plantings to foster the recovery of seasonal tropical forests in terms
   of structure and functionality in the long term. As for taxonomic
   diversity and richness, mixed plantings were more efficient, whereas
   pure plantings have not reached old-growth forests but did not differ
   from degraded and surpassed secondary forests in several attributes.
   These results highlight the relevance of planting trees, even in low
   diversity, for increasing biodiversity and providing ecosystem services
   on a landscape scale.},

Abstract = {Climate change and ecosystem degradation have achieved unprecedented
   levels nowadays. In this context, assessing restoration projects to
   recover native vegetation and ecosystem services is fundamental to
   understanding the success of these initiatives. This study evaluated the
   effects of different restoration techniques on the basal area,
   diversity, and composition of regenerating and planted species in a
   restoration area in the Atlantic Forest, Southeast Brazil. The
   experiment consisted of three treatments: row planting (ROW, 2 x 2 m
   spacing); nucleation (NUC, 13 individuals/nucleus, 5 x 5 m spacing); and
   control with passive restoration (PAS). The active restoration
   techniques had different planting densities at project implementation
   (NUC: 5,200 seedlings ha-1; ROW: 2,177 seedlings ha-1). A floristic
   survey was carried out within 8 sampling units (15 x 15 m) per treatment
   10 years after implementation of the project, including all planted and
   regenerating individuals with a diameter at ground level > 2.5 cm. The
   abundance, basal area, and species richness of the planted and
   regenerated communities were estimated. The active restoration
   techniques (ROW and NUC) resulted in higher values of basal area,
   abundance and species richness compared to passive restoration (PAS). A
   higher abundance of natural regeneration was observed in ROW than in
   NUC. Additionally, the rarefaction curves suggested a trend toward
   higher diversity indices in ROW. Regarding the successional trajectory,
   greater variation in species composition was observed in ROW after 10
   years of planting. The species composition was similar in ROW and NUC
   and differed from the composition in PAS. The species identified as
   indicator species in each treatment were Annona glabra L. in ROW, Trema
   micranthum (L.) Blume in NUC, and Vernonanthura polyanthes (Sprengel)
   Vega \& Dematteis in PAS. Our study revealed that active restoration
   techniques, such as seedling planting in rows and nuclei, were more
   effective in restoring ecological indicators than passive restoration.
   These results emphasize the importance of restoration techniques in
   enhancing plant community diversity and structure in the Brazilian
   Atlantic Forest.},

Journal = {FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {534},
Month = {APR 15},
Abstract = {In heterogeneous landscapes, such as the Brazilian Atlantic Forest,
   forest fragments are likely to undergo highly uncertain successional
   pathways because anthropogenic and environmental factors strongly affect
   demographic processes such as recruitment, growth, and mortality. We
   used data from 134 permanent plots (0.01-0.10 ha) across seven forest
   fragments in Minas Gerais, Brazil, to assess how anthropogenic variables
   and environmental factors drive demographic processes in Atlantic forest
   fragments. For each plot, we quantified anthropogenic variables related
   to land-use history (LUH) and estimated levels of fragmentation based on
   forest cover, forest fragment size, and distance to the forest edge. We
   also measured environmental factors related to topography (i. e.,
   elevation and slope), soil chemical characteristics (i.e., soil pH in
   H2O, exchangeable cations, P content and soil organic matter), and
   climate (i.e., average annual precipitation and climatic water deficit
   {[}CWD]). We used plot basal area (BA) as a proxy for forest age. We
   quantified the effect of anthropogenic and environmental factors on
   relative recruitment, growth, and mortality rates using linear
   mixed-effects models (LMM). We found that anthropogenic variables (LUH
   and BA) were stronger predictors of relative recruitment (p-value <
   0.001) than environmental variables. For relative growth, soil,
   elevation, and BA (p-value < 0.001) have the strongest effect. CWD
   (p-value < 0.001) was the most important predictor for mortality,
   suggesting that dry periods in-crease mortality rates in the studied
   fragments. Our findings suggest that the land-use history of individual
   fragments, combined with a higher frequency of drought events leading to
   increased mortality and turnover of individuals, will increase
   differences in demographic processes and successional pathways among
   fragments, thereby increasing the heterogeneity of these fragmented
   landscapes.},

Abstract = {Analysis of floristic similarity relationships between plant communities
   can detect patterns of species occurrence and also explain conditioning
   factors. Searching for such patterns, floristic similarity relationships
   among Atlantic Forest sites situated at Ibiuna Plateau, Sao Paulo state,
   Brazil, were analyzed by multivariate techniques. Twenty one forest
   fragments and six sites within a continuous Forest Reserve were included
   in the analyses. Floristic composition and structure of the tree
   community (minimum dbh 5 cm) were assessed using the point centered
   quarter method. Two methods were used for multivariate analysis:
   Detrended Correspondence Analysis (DCA) and Two-Way Indicator Species
   Analysis (TWINSPAN). Similarity relationships among the study areas were
   based on the successional stage of the community and also on spatial
   proximity. The more similar the successional stage of the communities,
   the higher the floristic similarity between them, especially if the
   communities are geographically close. A floristic gradient from north to
   south was observed, suggesting a transition between biomes, since
   northern indicator species are mostly heliophytes, occurring also in
   cerrado vegetation and seasonal semideciduous forest, while southern
   indicator species are mostly typical ombrophilous and climax species
   from typical dense evergreen Atlantic Forest.},

Abstract = {(Impact of seedling removal on regenerating community structure of a
   seasonal semideciduous forest). Transplanting seedlings and saplings
   from natural forests has been considered an alternative to producing
   saplings of native species for forest restoration purposes, but the
   possible impact of this procedure on plant community regeneration has
   not been investigated. This work evaluates the impact of different
   treatments of shrub and tree-seedling (up to 30 cm) removal from a
   seasonal semideciduous forest fragment located in southeastern Brazil on
   the natural regeneration process. Eighty 2x2 m plots were installed in
   two habitats (forest edge and interior) and submitted to four
   seedling-removal treatments (I, II - 100\% removal with or without soil
   mixing; III - 50\% removal without soil mixing: and IV - control
   treatment Without seedling removal). Regeneration density and richness
   were evaluated before treatment as well as 6, 12 and 18 months later.
   The results were compared among treatments for each evaluation period
   and among periods within treatments. There were similarities between
   edge and interior. The natural regeneration process did not improve with
   soil mixing. Plots submitted to seedling removal partially recovered
   plant density; however, these plots had lower species richness when
   compared to the control and to the initial values before treatment.
   Seedling removal has a negative impact on the regeneration process of
   low-density species, thus the use of natural regeneration as a sapling
   source for forest restoration purposes should focus only on high-density
   species with well-known regeneration strategies and not on the community
   as a whole.},

   analyze variations of natural regeneration in two successional stages

   two abandoned pastures were sampled in Serra do Itajai National Park
   (PNSI), Santa Catarina state, Southern Brazil. In the analysis of the
   main components, the plots differed according to the change in the
   quantitative variables of the species (Monte Carlo, P <= 0.05), and two
   groups were segregated: the first one constituted by the vegetation in
   the initial stage, and the second one, by intermediate stage vegetation.
   Twenty-one species were sampled and the intermediate stage showed the
   greatest richness (n = 19). The pioneer species were predominant in both
   stages, especially Vernonanthura discolor, Piptocarpha regnellii and
   Myrsine coriacea. The results demonstrate that the initial stage does
   not have indicator species, because all species occur frequently in the
   intermediate stage. However, the intermediate stage was distinguished by
   the presence of eight indicator species, which are potentially
   recommended for reforestation and enrichment plantations of Montana

Abstract = {Most tropical landscapes are mainly composed of dynamic mosaics
   involving multiple land uses. Different histories of land use management
   can lead to different successional paths. The aim of this study was to
   determine if there is a successional floristic gradient related to land
   use types and how these gradients change across three rural mosaics in
   Eastern Amazon. We also investigated what are the indicator species
   across mosaics and land use types and how they change through
   succession. Five sampling points were established in nine family farms
   at each mosaic. A detrended correspondence analysis was used to reveal
   the successional gradient. A multivariate regression tree was used to
   analyze differences in floristic composition between mosaics and land
   uses. Floristic similarity between land uses formed successional
   gradient at the mosaics, in which agricultural land uses represent the
   early stages of secondary succession and forests represent more advanced
   stages. Total number of species and total number of shade-tolerant
   species were correlated with advanced successional stages in all
   mosaics, but pioneer trees were also correlated with advanced stages in
   fragmented mosaics. Each mosaic had a distinct successional series due
   to different management approaches. Where the matrix was mainly composed
   of forest fragments and the human intervention period was shorter, land
   use types were more similar to one another as they were grouped into
   fewer successional stages. Thus, the floristic similarity between land
   use types appears as an indicator of successional advancement across the
   mosaics and help determine the regenerative capacity of those areas.},

Abstract = {Forests provides major ecosystem services worldwide. The Brazilian
   Atlantic Forest (BAF) has been dramatically devastated, with
   fragmentation processes jeopardizing its long-term sustainability. This
   study investigated the structure and successional dynamics in BAF
   natural regeneration along an anthroposequence characterized by
   increasing human disturbance histories as: secondary (SF) > disturbed
   (DF) > late forest (LF). We aimed to understand how and the degree to
   which BAF fragmentation and human disturbance affected plants, soils,
   and the whole soil-plant relationships and feedbacks. We investigated
   the natural regeneration conditions of plants (using plant
   classification and quali-quantitative analyses) and soil chemistry
   (including pH-CaCl2, H + Al, C, N, Pt, cation-exchange capacity (CEC),
   exchangeable cations, Al, B, Cu, Fe, K, Mn, and Zn) at twelve permanent,
   2000 m2 plots, distributed across LF, DF, and SF forests. Significant
   differences were determined by ANOVA. Correlation matrix (CM) and factor
   analysis (FA) were used for understanding correlations and feedbacks/
   variability among investigated parameters, respectively. Most of
   investigated plant and soil parameters showed significant differences (p
   < 0.05) between more developed plant formations (LF) vs less developed
   ones (SF), with differences mainly due to soil's development stage. All
   investigated forest formations are featured by a great influence of the
   soil-plant relationships and feedbacks, with a decreasing magnitude as
   LF-{*} DF-{*} SF. Thus, there is a direct, statistically recognizable
   impact of both ``recent{''} as well as ``ancient{''} human disturbance
   on investigated soil-plant formations. The anthropogenic influence
   clearly affected not only plant and soil as ``separate{''} systems but
   the whole complex of interactions and feedbacks among ecosystem
   components. A decreasing quality in soil and plant parameters was
   observed as human disturbance increased. We demonstrated that BAF plant
   and soil require decades for their recovery after human disturbances,
   with complex mechanisms and behaviors in the relationships among
   ecosystem components. The results can be useful for managing future
   recovery in an ecosystem of worldwide strategic importance.},

Abstract = {Secondary succession is an important process in the Amazonian region
   with implications for the global carbon cycle and for the sustainable
   regional agricultural and pasture activities. In order to better
   discriminate the secondary succession and to characterize and estimate
   the aboveground biomass (AGB), backscatter and interferometric SAR data
   generally have been analyzed through empirical-based statistical
   modeling. The objective of this study is to verify the capability of the
   full polarimetric PALSAR/ALOS (L-band) attributes, when combined with
   the interferometric (InSAR) coherence from the TanDEM-X (X-band), to
   improve the AGB estimates of the succession chronosequence located in
   the Brazilian Tapajos region. In order to perform this study, we carried
   out multivariate regression using radar attributes and biophysical
   parameters acquired during a field inventory. A previous
   floristic-structural analysis was performed to establish the
   chronosequence in three stages: initial vegetation regrowth,
   intermediate, and advanced regrowth. The relationship between PALSAR
   data and AGB was significant (p< 0.001) and results suggested that the
   ``volumetric scattering{''} (Pv) and ``anisotropy{''} (A) attributes
   were important to explain the biomass content of the successional
   chronosequence (R-adjusted(2) = 0.67; RMSE = 32.29 Mg. ha(-1)). By
   adding the TanDEM-derived interferometric coherence (gamma(i)) into the
   regression modeling, better results were obtained (R y adjusted = 0.75;
   RMSE = 28.78Mg. ha(-1)). When we used both the L-and X-band attributes,
   the stock density prediction improved to 10.8 \% for the secondary
   succession stands.},

Abstract = {Restinga forests are one of the most threatened coastal ecosystems
   associated with the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. As there have been very
   few studies of the regeneration of those forest remnants, and their many
   different regeneration times, we examined the composition and structure
   of species in both conserved and disturbed Restinga forest sites within
   a conservation area on the eastern coast of Rio de Janeiro State,
   Brazil. Surveys of shrub/tree species were undertaken in 80 plots (25
   m(2)) in which all woody plants were tagged, identified, measured
   (diameter and height), and their regrowth capacity (from roots and/or
   stems) evaluated. We classified the species according to their growth
   habits and dispersal syndromes. Comparisons of the conserved and
   disturbed areas were made based on phytosociological parameters. We
   encountered 104 species occurring exclusively in the conserved area and
   45 species occurring exclusively in the disturbed area. Only thirteen
   species were shared by both areas (low floristic similarity), although
   those showed divergent tree canopy growth parameters. We identified
   strong differences in the floristic and structural components of
   disturbed and conserved areas, indicating the high conservation
   relevance of the latter. Our results evidence the low resilience to
   disturbance of Restinga forests, even considering the contiguity between
   conserved and disturbed areas. Species common to both areas evidenced
   diverse functional traits (fast-growing, zoochorous, resprouters,
   N-2-fixing traits) valuable to ecological restoration activities. These
   findings may assist policymakers in developing efficient restoration and
   conservation strategies for this forest type.},

Journal = {ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {194},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Assessing and monitoring are essential steps for the restoration
   process. These processes require ecological indicators to evaluate the
   re-establishment of the ecological processes that maintain the forest
   dynamics. However, the majority of studies involving ecological
   indicators developed in Brazil are aimed at monitoring active
   restorations, with specific indicators. In this context, the current
   study aimed to characterize the seed rain and litterfall, and verify
   their applicability as relevant ecological indicators in the evaluation
   of the passive forest restoration process in riparian forest. These
   areas are of different ages, post-harvest of Pinus taeda L. stands,
   within the Araucaria Forest, which is part of an important global
   hotspot for biodiversity conservation. We evaluated the floristic
   composition of the seed rain and the measurement of the litter supply at
   five different ages of the restoration process, for one year. The
   efficiency of these indicators was defined by means of a classification
   based on aspects and descriptors. We hypothesized that these two
   indicators are suitable for assessing and monitoring the restoration
   trajectory and can describe the reestablishment of ecological processes
   in anthropized areas. These indicators are important because they
   determine the restoration of the functionality of altered ecosystems.
   The results showed that both are good indicators, mainly due to the
   sensitivity and scale criteria, since the indicators showed seasonal
   differences in the evaluated period. They can be used as scientific
   indicators for monitoring forest restoration in altered ecosystems.},

Abstract = {CHRIS/PROBA data collected in the Brazilian Amazonia in 4 view angles
   (-36 degrees, nadir, +36 degrees, +55 degrees) and 62 bands (410-1000 nm
   range) were evaluated for the discrimination between primary forest and
   3 stages of secondary succession after deforestation: initial (SS1; <5
   years), intermediate (SS2; 5-15 years) and advanced (SS3; >15 years).
   Single view angle and multiangular approaches (nadir plus anisotropic
   information derived from reflectance ratios between view angles) were
   tested for discrimination. Both approaches used principal components
   analysis (PCA) applied to pixel spectra representative of each class in
   order to reduce data dimensionality at each dataset, to enhance
   separability between the classes, and to provide input variables for
   multiple discriminant analysis (MDA). The results showed that the
   off-nadir viewing improved discrimination between the successional
   stages. Discrimination between SS2 and SS3 was enhanced with PCA at +36
   degrees view angle. Primary forest and SS3 presented a more anisotropic
   behavior than SS2 and SS1, especially in the backward scattering
   direction (positive view angles) in which great amounts of sunlit canopy
   components were viewed by the sensor. MDA classification results showed
   that the multiangular approach produced an overall improvement in the
   discrimination. From the single (nadir) to the multiangular approach,
   classification accuracy using a separate set of pixels increased from
   83.3\% to 98.3\% for SS1, 53.3\% to 70.0\% for SS2, and 58.3\% to 76.7\%
   for SS3. The nadir and multiangular classifications were statistically
   different at a 0.05\% level of significance. Kappa statistics increased
   from 0.63 to 0.82. The results showed that multiangular data can improve
   the differentiation between primary forest and old stages of natural
   vegetation regrowth, which have been reported in the literature as the
   most difficult classes to be mapped in the Amazonian environment. (C)

Abstract = {When primary forest in central Amazonia is cut and abandoned, the plant

   The bird communities of these two regrowth forest types were sampled at
   six sites (9-13 years old) using mist-nets and observations. Bird
   species richness was similar between the two forest types. Cecropia
   regrowth, however, was richer for strictly forest bird species than was
   Vismia regrowth. Mixed-flock species and ant-following birds were
   significantly more abundant in the Cecropia second growth, whereas
   nonforest insectivores and omnivores were more common in Vismia
   regrowth. The type of regrowth was found to influence bird species
   composition in the study sites. These results suggest that the type of
   human disturbance has an important role in determining the bird
   communities that occupy early successional areas in central Amazonia.},

Abstract = {Amazon rainforest is facing several threats due to anthropogenic
   activities causing loss of habitat, species, and ecosystem functions.
   However, several areas are being abandoned after anthropic use allowing
   secondary succession to occur, which can lead to the passive restoration
   of community parameters that have been lost. We aimed to investigate the
   effects of vegetation structure on dung beetle assemblages along a
   successional gradient in the western Amazon rainforest. Dung beetles
   were sampled and forest structure variables were measured using
   standardized protocols along primary, late secondary, and early
   secondary forests. We used a combination of generalized linear models
   and multivariate analyses to test for differences in assemblage
   composition and structure among successional stages and their
   relationships with vegetation variables. We found that primary forests
   have different species compositions from both late and early
   successional forests, with several species strongly associated with
   primary forests. Dung beetle abundance was higher in primary forests and
   influenced by variables describing the successional stages (i.e., tree
   density). Species turnover was the most important beta-diversity
   component among and within each successional stage, with lower values in
   early secondary forests. Different pathways followed by secondary
   forests during forest succession may lead to increased species turnover
   similar to that found in primary forests. Biodiversity conservation will
   only work if secondary forests are allowed to recover to a late
   successional stage close to a primary forest stage. The loss of primary
   forests can cause an irreversible loss of species in need of
   conservation and with great functional importance in the Amazon
   rainforest.},

Abstract = {As forests in neotropical regions, particularly in developing countries,
   are devastated, interventions to restore biodiversity and its ecological
   functions are needed. Rural producers have thus been encouraged to grow
   trees for wood production as an economic activity. The objective of this
   study was to quantify the increment of wood density of four forest
   species from different successional classes of a mixed system of
   restoration in a neotropical forest in Brazil. Tree discs were sampled
   at breast height and analyzed radially by X-ray densitometry to obtain
   apparent density and basic density. Three trees each of a species from
   the pioneer, early and late secondary successional stages and of the
   dominant species in the climax community. The radial profiles indicated
   increasing density from the pith to bark of trunks, except for some
   variations due to wood defects and growth. Average density was 0.576 g
   cm(-3), 0.655 g cm(-3), 0.706 g cm(-3) and 0.775 g cm(-3), respectively,
   for Peltophorum dubium, Schinus terebinthifolius, Cariniana estrellensis
   and Hymenaea courbaril. Radial profiles indicated higher amplitudes in
   the apparent densities for slow-growing species. X-ray densitometry
   generated parameters such as minimum, average and maximum densities, and
   radial density variations. These parameters are important for
   understanding the ecological functional role of successional classes of
   the Atlantic Forest from the Neotropical region.},

Title = {Response of central Amazon rainforest soil seed banks to climate
   change-Simulation of global warming},
Journal = {FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {493},
Month = {AUG 1},
Abstract = {The most severe global warming is predicted to occur in the Amazon
   region of Brazil, with an estimated temperature increase of 4 to 8
   degrees C between 2071 and 2100. Our study evaluated the effects of
   increased temperatures on germination success of seeds in the soil seed
   bank of secondary forests in Central Amazonia. Soil samples (3cm depth)
   were collected in six secondary forests with different land-use
   histories and ages of regrowth. Soils from all sites were sieved and
   mixed, and germination and seedling development were assessed during 4
   months of incubation in germination chambers at (1) a constant
   temperature of 25 degrees C and a 12:12 h alternating temperature regime
   of 20:30 degrees C, considered as controls; (2) a simulated 5 degrees C
   temperature increase to 30 degrees C and 25:35 degrees C and (3) a 10
   degrees C temperature increase to 35 degrees C and 30:40 degrees C. To
   determine the effect of light vs. dark on germination, germination was
   compared for samples in light (12 h daily photoperiod) vs. continuously
   dark for 1 month, followed by 3 months in light. Six temperature
   conditions were tested with 30 subsamples each. In the mixed soil seed
   bank, 3640 seeds germinated, of which 18 families, 28 genera and 41
   species (grouped in 20 trees, 11 shrubs, eight herbs and two lianas)
   could be identified. A light requirement for germination was detected
   for 94-97\% of the species. Alternating temperatures did not stimulate
   germination in the dark. Seedling density m- 2 was 1.7 to 2.3 times
   higher at alternating (20:30 degrees C and 25:35 degrees C) than at
   constant temperatures (25 degrees C and 30 degrees C); but an increase
   of 10 degrees C decreased seedling density to 47\% at 35 degrees C and
   26\% at 30:40 degrees C compared to control (100\% at 25 degrees C and
   20:30 degrees C); and furthermore increased seedling mortality. Thus,
   the secondary forest at the study area may maintain its integrity with a
   5 degrees C but not with a 10 degrees C temperature increase.
   Species-specific sensitivities to temperature were detected. Temperature
   may function to fine-tune germination at a specific microsite, and the
   variety of germination requirements may enhance coexistence and
   maintenance of species diversity within the pioneer species subset. In
   general, seeds of tree species were more sensitive to increased
   temperatures than those of shrubs and herbs, supporting the hypothesis
   of replacement of the tropical forest by savanna-like vegetation in the
   Amazon region. Our results show that natural regeneration may be
   significantly affected by global warming and with potential to alter
   floristic composition.},

Abstract = {Seed dispersal is fundamental to tropical forest resilience. Forest loss
   or degradation typically leads to defaunation, altering seed transfer
   dynamics and impairing the ability of forested habitats to regenerate or
   recover from perturbation. However, the extent of defaunation, and its
   likely impacts on the seed dispersers needed to restore highly degraded
   or clear-felled areas, remains poorly understood in tropical forest
   landscapes.To quantify defaunation of seed-dispersing birds, we used
   field survey data from 499 transects in three forested regions of
   Brazil, first comparing the observed assemblages with those predicted by
   geographic range maps, and then assessing habitat associations of
   frugivores across land cover gradients.We found that current bird
   assemblages have lower functional diversity (FD) than predicted by
   species range maps in Amazonia (4\%-6\%), with a greater reduction in FD
   (28\%) for the Atlantic Forest, which has been more heavily deforested
   for a longer period.Direct measures of seed dispersal are difficult to
   obtain, so we focused on potential seed transfer inferred from shared
   species occurrence. Of 83 predominantly frugivorous bird species
   recorded in relatively intact forests, we show that 10\% were absent
   from degraded forest, and 57\% absent from the surrounding matrix of
   agricultural land covers, including many large-gaped species. Of 112
   frugivorous species using degraded forest, 47\% were absent from matrix
   habitats. Overall, frugivores occurring in both intact forest and matrix
   habitats were outnumbered by (mostly small-gaped) frugivores occurring
   in both degraded forest and matrix habitats (23 additional species; 64\%
   higher diversity).These findings suggest that birds have the potential
   to disperse seeds from intact and degraded forest to adjacent cleared
   lands, but that direct seed transfer from intact forests is limited,
   particularly for large-seeded trees. Degraded forests may play a vital
   role in supporting natural regeneration of small-seeded tree species as
   well as providing a `stepping-stone' in the regeneration pathway for
   large-seeded trees. We propose that both intact and degraded forests
   will support the restoration potential of tropical forest landscapes,
   and that bird-assisted seed dispersal can be enhanced by maintaining
   buffer zones of degraded or secondary forests around remaining intact
   forest patches.},

Title = {Avian ecological succession in the Amazon: A long-term case study
   following experimental deforestation},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {9},
Number = {24},
Pages = {13850-13861},

Abstract = {Approximately 20\% of the Brazilian Amazon has now been deforested, and
   the Amazon is currently experiencing the highest rates of deforestation
   in a decade, leading to large-scale land-use changes. Roads have
   consistently been implicated as drivers of ongoing Amazon deforestation
   and may act as corridors to facilitate species invasions. Long-term
   data, however, are necessary to determine how ecological succession
   alters avian communities following deforestation and whether established
   roads lead to a constant influx of new species. We used data across
   nearly 40 years from a large-scale deforestation experiment in the
   central Amazon to examine the avian colonization process in a spatial
   and temporal framework, considering the role that roads may play in
   facilitating colonization. Since 1979, 139 species that are not part of
   the original forest avifauna have been recorded, including more
   secondary forest species than expected based on the regional species
   pool. Among the 35 species considered to have colonized and become
   established, a disproportionate number were secondary forest birds
   (63\%), almost all of which first appeared during the 1980s. These new
   residents comprise about 13\% of the current community of permanent
   residents. Widespread generalists associated with secondary forest
   colonized quickly following deforestation, with few new species added
   after the first decade, despite a stable road connection. Few species
   associated with riverine forest or specialized habitats colonized,
   despite road connection to their preferred source habitat. Colonizing
   species remained restricted to anthropogenic habitats and did not
   infiltrate old-growth forests nor displace forest birds. Deforestation
   and expansion of road networks into terra firme rainforest will continue
   to create degraded anthropogenic habitat. Even so, the initial pulse of
   colonization by nonprimary forest bird species was not the beginning of
   a protracted series of invasions in this study, and the process appears
   to be reversible by forest succession.},

Abstract = {Studies of the dynamics in vegetal communities are essential to
   understand the cerrado ecology's behavior, especially considering its
   wide geographical distribution and heterogeneity. This kind of study
   helps to comprehend the mechanisms that maintain the community,
   generating subsidies for its conservation. This study aimed to analyze
   the tree community's dynamics over five years in a cerrado sensu stricto
   swath of 87ha. It wass protected from fire for about 30 years and is
   located in the municipality of Olhos-d'Agua, North of Minas Gerais
   State, Brazil. The assumed hypothesis was that the period of protection
   from fire was sufficient for the community to stabilize its dynamics and
   thus, to compose a mature structure. The data obtained refer to 24
   permanent plots of 1.000 m(2) ( total of 2.4 ha), where all trees with
   diameter at breast high 1.30 above the soil (DBH) >= 5 cm were marked,
   measured and sampled in the years 2005 and 2010. The changes in the
   phytosociological structure were analyzed and the mortality and
   recruitment rates were estimated basing on the density, gain and loss in
   basal area, stability and turnover times, and the periodic annual
   increment of the community and populations. This cerrado area presented
   a dynamic balance, with little variation in floristic composition and
   phytosociological and the structuring of the woody component had
   increased relatively. The populations' growth that is sensitive to fire
   suggests an ecological succession influenced by the absence of fire.},

Abstract = {Caesalpinia echinata Lam. (Caesalpiniaceae) is a tree species that
   naturally regenerates in the forest understory and reaches the upper
   canopy through small gaps. We conducted a study with the objective of
   comparing some aspects of leaf morphology of adult individuals, in which
   the leaves were exposed to full sunlight, and saplings, grown in the
   forest understory. The study was conducted in a semidecidual forest in
   Jussari, southern Bahia, Brazil. Initially, eight adult and eight
   sapling individuals were selected and marked. In September/October, 2004
   and April, 2005 eight leaves for each adult and three leaves for each
   sapling individual were collected and analyzed. In general, the area of
   leaves, rachis and leaflets, the length of rachis, the width of leaves,
   the number of pinnes and the dried mass of leaves were significantly
   higher in young individuals. Notwithstanding, the specific mass of
   leaves and leaflets were significantly higher in the adults. For both,
   adults and saplings, strong relationships were observed between the leaf
   dried mass and leaf area. Based on the results, we conclude that the
   leaves of C. echinata present characteristics that allow the
   maximization of light absorption in environments in which light
   radiation is a limiting factor, at the same time allocating carbon to
   the support tissues. The results obtained in the present study were in
   accordance with the successional status of this tree species and its
   strategies to occupy small canopy gaps of the semidecidual forest

Abstract = {The development of the mangrove in Ceara state, northeastern Brazil, is
   limited by local environmental and climatic factors, associated with the
   variables that determine the region's semi-arid climatic conditions. The
   same conditions also contribute to the installation of artisanal
   saltworks in estuarine environments. The artisanal production of salt
   peaked in the 20th century, but with the decline of this activity, the
   salt evaporation ponds were abandoned, and have been incorporated back
   into the natural marine-estuarine environment and colonized by mangrove
   forests. In the early 2000s, however, the expansion of shrimp farming
   operations impacted this same environment. The present study was based
   on a spatiotemporal analysis of the natural regeneration of the mangrove
   vegetation in abandoned salt pond areas in the Brazilian semi-arid
   region between 1968 and 2009. The integrated analysis of mangrove
   ecosystem dynamics and the legislation that regulates the licensing of
   these economic activities identified a number of technical problems in
   the formulation and execution of the COEMA resolution 02/2002, which
   permits the installation of shrimp farms in areas dominated by the
   mangrove. The findings of the present study reinforce the need for a
   careful reformulation of the Ceara state environmental legislation, in
   order to guarantee the maximum possible conservation of the coastal

Abstract = {The study of the structure and dynamics of natural regeneration in the
   understory of plantations with exotic species, such as those of the
   genus Pinus, makes it possible to provide information to management,
   conservation and re-establishment of native species in a plant
   community. The aim of this study was to identify and quantify the
   dynamics of natural regeneration of woody tree species occurring in the
   understory of Pinus caribaea in Rebio of Saltinho, Pernambuco state,
   Brazil. Regenerating species were measured for 10 permanent plots, 1 x
   50 m, and included individuals with circumference at the base to 30 cm
   from the ground (CAB 0, 30 m) <= 15 cm and height of more than one
   meter. The height was classified in: Class 1, shrubby tree, individuals
   with height 1 <= H <= 2; Class 2 with 2 height < H <= 3; and Class 3,
   with height > 3 m and <= 15 cm CAP. Phytosociological parameters were
   calculated, the dynamics of the regeneration and the Shannon index (H `)
   and evenness (J `) by Pielou. Protium heptaphyllum had as many
   individuals and value of importance (VI) and Miconia prasina the best
   frequency in the two surveys. How to index H ` of 3,32 nats. ind(-1)
   (2007) went to 3,07 nats. ind-1 (2012), and the evenness of J ` of 0,85
   to 0,62, and decrease for both the diversity and the distribution. The
   2012 survey recorded 12,5\% increase in the number of individuals, and
   the regenerating of 2007 had 48,31\% mortality. With respect to the
   number of individuals and basal area, the percentage gains were greater
   than the losses. It is concluded that the ecological succession of
   understorey regeneration of the population studied, lies in positive
   modification, and the settlement of Pinus caribaea, is preventing the
   emergence of new individuals and species.},

Journal = {RESTORATION ECOLOGY},
Year = {2025},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Abandoned pastures with degraded soil quality in the Amazon region often
   undergo succession to secondary forests. While aboveground responses to
   natural regeneration have been well investigated, the impacts on soil
   functioning are still poorly understood. Here we assessed how multiple
   soil functions respond to the natural regeneration of abandoned pastures
   in the Amazon, and how many years of forest regeneration are needed to
   recover soil multifunctionality. We measured key properties of the soil
   as proxy indicators of six soil functions: (1) support for plant growth,
   (2) C sequestration, (3) nutrient storage and availability, (4)
   resistance to degradation, (5) water and air flux regulation, and (6)
   biological activity along a 45-year chronosequence of natural
   regeneration in northwestern Colombia, and then we calculated an index
   of soil multifunctionality. The results revealed significant changes in
   physical-chemical and biological soil indicators due to the
   reforestation, increasing soil multifunctionality. The largest effects
   were found for soil C sequestration, with a sub-index value that was
   nearly two times higher after 15 years of regeneration, followed by
   biological activity and resistance to degradation functions that
   increased 1.4 and 1.3 times, respectively, after 15 years of
   regeneration. The overall index of soil functioning indicated a clear
   benefit of restoration, reaching 76\% of its soil functioning capacity
   after 15 years of pasture abandonment. Thus, our findings provide
   empirical evidence that secondary forest succession can restore soils'
   capacity to deliver vital ecosystem services in the Amazon region,

Title = {Ecosystem restoration after bauxite mining: favorable indicators for
   Technosols construction and soil management using liming and subsoiling},

Year = {2021},
Volume = {52},

Abstract = {Although its economic importance, bauxite mining causes the loss of
   natural ecosystems. In this sense, the Technosols building from
   materials made or modified by man, such as mine tailings, is necessary
   for recovering degraded areas. Additionally, the Technosols management,
   such as subsoiling and liming, increases chances of plants establishment
   and growth. In this study, a degraded area by bauxite mining with
   constructed Technosol in the Eastern Amazon, Brazil, was tested under
   three different soil management treatments: Technosol-1 (Tech-1), Liming
   only; Technosol-2 (Tech-2), Subsoiling + 200 g of NPK in the pit;
   Technosol-3 (Tech-3), Scarification + liming + all Tech-2 procedures. In
   every treatment and in a reference forest (R-forest), 8 years after the
   initial seedling planting, three types of indicators were assessed:
   structural (horizontal vegetation structure, density of natural
   regeneration, and soil cover), compositional (species diversity,
   ecological groups, and dispersal syndromes), and functional (chemical
   properties of Technosols and dry matter and nutrients from the litter
   stock). The most representative species in all treatments were Croton
   matourensis and Vismia guianensis, both coming from the natural
   regeneration and common in early successional stages. Coverage rates in
   all treatments showed less than 5\% of exposed Technosol and the
   diversity, ecological group, and dispersal syndrome indexes followed a
   successful trajectory along 8 years. Tech-2 and Tech-3 presented the
   best chemical attributes and nutrients in the litter stock, but they
   would probably last several decades to reach the R-forest attributes.
   Thus, subsoiling alone or with liming provided the best chemical results
   for soil, litter, and vegetation performance, being recommended to speed
   up restoration of degrades areas by bauxite mining in the Amazon.},

Abstract = {This research aims to contribute to the recovery of degraded areas in
   the cerrado. The study site is located in the Federal District, Brazil,
   and includes quartzitic sand exploration under cerrado stricto sensu,
   with deforestation licensed by IBRAM/DF. Natural regeneration was
   investigated after the exploration of sand, due to the return of the
   original surface soil layer (topsoil) to the area, and the influence of
   a hydrogel polymer on the survival of native seedlings planted with the
   objective to facilitate forest restoration. The results indicated a
   mortality in the community planted of 11\% in seven months, considered
   low and may be related to the efficiency of hydrogel polymer. Natural
   regeneration, absent at the time of planting, was intense in the second
   evaluation, when it recorded a prevalence of Mimosa claussenii Benth,
   representing between 26 and 50\% soil cover. The results suggest the
   effectiveness of the degraded area back to the original topsoil, as
   transports cuttings from plants, which makes forest restoration, and the
   efficiency of using polymer as a soil conditioner.},

Abstract = {Characterizing and monitoring the Brazilian Atlantic Domain provide
   important direction for the conservation of its remnants. Short-term
   variations in forest composition and structure are usually lost in
   larger intervals between inventories and could better elucidate forest
   dynamics. This study aimed to analyze temporal changes in the structure,
   floristic composition and diversity of a tree community of an
   Ombrophilous Dense Forest remnant in Bocaina de Minas, Minas Gerais
   state, Brazil, in two short intervals. The study was conducted based on
   circumference at breast height (1.3 m) (CBH) data from three forest
   inventories (2009, 2011, and 2012) in twelve 400 m (2) permanent plots
   randomly distributed in the area. The results point out to a forest
   characterized by the increase in plant density and basal area, mainly
   due to the continuous local anthropogenic disturbances observed in the
   area, such as the presence of cattle and trails. These disturbances
   start early successional processes in various sectors of the forest. The
   altitudinal gradient leads to great environmental heterogeneity,
   resulting in a high species turnover, as well as high values of
   diversity which remained unchanged in the intervals considered.},

Abstract = {The Northwest Forest Plan (NWFP) initiated one of the most sweeping
   changes to forest management in the world, affecting 10 million hectares
   of federal land. The NWFP is a science-based plan incorporating
   monitoring and adaptive management and provides a unique opportunity to
   evaluate the influence of policy. We used >25 years of region-wide bird
   surveys, forest data, and landownership maps to test this policy's
   effect on biodiversity. Clearcutting decreased rapidly, and we expected
   populations of older-forest-associated birds to stabilize on federal
   land, but to continue declining on private industrial lands where
   clearcutting continued. In contrast, we expected declines in
   early-seral-associated species on federal land because of reduced
   anthropogenic disturbance since the NWFP. Bayesian hierarchical models
   revealed that bird species' population trends tracked changes in forest
   composition. However, against our expectations, declines of birds
   associated with older forests accelerated. These declines are partly
   explained by losses of older forests due to fire on federal land and
   continued clearcutting elsewhere. Indeed, the NWFP anticipated that
   reversing declines of older forests would take time. Overall, the
   early-seral ecosystem area was stable, but declined in two
   ecoregions-the Coast Range and Cascades-along with early-seral bird
   populations. Although the NWFP halted clearcutting on federal land, this
   has so far been insufficient to reverse declines in
   older-forest-associated bird populations. These findings underscore the
   importance of continuing to prioritize older forests under the NWFP and
   ensuring that the recently proposed creation of early-seral ecosystems
   does not impede the conservation and development of older-forest
   structure.},

Title = {Combining Climber Cutting and Tree Seedling Planting Improves Structural
   Attributes of a Seasonal Semideciduous Forest in Southeastern Brazil},
Journal = {BIOTROPICA},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {57},
Number = {2},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Management of degraded tropical forest fragments is usually done by
   cutting climbers (cutting). However, it is still necessary to understand
   the outcomes of cutting in combination with planting native tree
   species' seedlings (cutting + planting), especially on the edges of
   fragments, which are subject to higher disturbance than the forest
   interior. We tested whether cutting + planting is the restoration
   strategy that most improves structural attributes of a degraded edge of
   a tropical seasonal semideciduous forest fragment in southeastern
   Brazil, relative to cutting and the absence of management (control).
   Linear mixed models revealed that, after an eight-year period, cutting +
   planting resulted in the highest decrease in the density and basal area
   of climbers longer than 1 m, and in the highest increase in the density
   of large living trees (diameter at breast height, DBH, >= 4.8 cm).
   Although cutting + planting decreased the percentage of large dead trees
   and increased tree sapling (DBH < 4.8 cm and total height >= 50 cm)
   richness, these variables were more affected by cutting. Management had
   no effect on the basal area of large living trees and tree sapling
   density. Because most structural attributes of the degraded edge studied
   were improved by cutting + planting, we advocate that it is the best
   strategy tested here for restoring tropical seasonal forests. We
   hypothesize that seedling planting improves forest conditions and
   stimulates recruitment, facilitating the regeneration of tree species.
   Thus, an interesting future avenue is to elucidate the mechanisms by
   which seedling planting affects regeneration and its long-lasting
   effects on forest structural attributes.},

Abstract = {The Brazilian Atlantic Forest (BAF) is a global biodiversity hotspot,
   but its carbon sink capacity, especially in the subtropical portion, is
   poorly understood. We aimed to evaluate the relationship between
   biodi-versity measures (i.e., taxonomic, functional, and phylogenetic
   diversity) and net carbon change across subtropical BAF, testing whether
   there is a win-win situation in the conservation of biodiversity and car
   -bon sink capacity across forests of distinct ages. We obtained the net
   carbon change from 55 permanent plots, from early successional to
   old-growth forests, by combining the carbon gains and losses across two
   censuses. We found that subtropical BAF are on average acting as a
   carbon sink, but carbon gains and losses varied a lot across plots,
   especially within late successional/old-growth forests. The carbon sink
   was consistent across different forest ages, and we did not find a
   relationship between biodiversity and net carbon change in subtropical
   BAF. Therefore, conservation programs should aim at both targets in
   order to maximize the protection of biodiversity and carbon capture
   across the secondary and old-growth subtropical BAF, especially in a
   scenario of global changes.(c) 2023 Associacao Brasileira de Ciencia

Abstract = {This study was carried out on a fragment of semi-deciduous forest in
   Pirenopolis, Goias, Brazil and investigated the changes in the photon
   flux density in relation to silvicultural interventions that aimed at
   increasing growth of tree species but without allowing invasion by
   exotic species that could influence the dynamics of natural
   regeneration. The design was a randomized block in factorial, testing
   the differences between silvicultural treatments, seasons and heights in
   the understory (1.30 m versus at the ground level). We tested two
   intensities of selective cutting of individual trees and vines in the
   forest. The treatments were sufficient to alter the understory light,
   both in the dry season and rainy season, in agreement with the
   hypothesis tested. The shading in the control area was 97\% in the rainy
   season and 86\% in the dry season, showing significant differences with
   the shading associated with silvicultural treatments, which ranged from
   93\% to 94\% in the rainy season and from 77\% to 80\% in the dry
   season. This study may assist this forest management system for
   semi-deciduous forests in Central Brazil, and should be linked to
   population studies and community, preserving the forest fragments found

   advance in the succession process after 150 years of regeneration? The
   survey was done on 25 plots of 5 x 5 in, where all the individuals with
   diameter at breast height (DBH) < 5 cm and height > 1 m were sampled. We
   found 1297 individuals, distributed in 84 species. Three alien species
   with potential invasive acquaintance were found: Coffea arabica,
   Artocarpus heterophyllus and Persea americana. Coffea arabica showed the
   highest importance value in the community. Shannon diversity index was
   H'= 3,10 nats.ind(-1), and Pielou equability J' = 0.70. The cluster
   analysis (Morisita-Horn coefficient) showed a community with low
   internal heterogeneity. The analysis of ecological groups revealed a
   community with predominantly early successional groups. Despite of 150
   years of natural regeneration, our findings indicated a community with
   difficulties in advancing to higher successional stages. This study is
   important to highlight the risk of invasive alien species in landscaping

Abstract = {The objective was to characterize the composition of the epiedaphic
   macrofauna in areas undergoing initial forest restoration using
   different restoration technologies and to compare these parameters with
   a reference forest. The study was conducted in the experimental area of
   Ecological Restoration of the UTFPR, Dois Vizinhos/Parana state, in
   randomized blocks, composed of three treatments (RP-passive restoration,
   PAD-high diversity planting, and NC-nucleation) with four repetitions.
   Adjacent to this, the fragment of secondary native forest (FL), is used
   as a reference. The collections were made in November 2010 and April
   2011, and three pitfall traps were installed in each plot. Richness and
   abundance were submitted to normality tests, homogeneity of variance and
   analysis of variance, and the Shannon and Pielou indices were
   calculated. The abundance data of the taxonomic groups were submitted to
   principal component analysis (PCA). To verify the differences in the
   macrofauna composition between the forest and restoration technologies,
   similarity analysis (ANOSIM) and percentage of similarity (SIMPER) were
   performed. We sampled 12,681 individuals, 3,018 in November/2010 and
   9,663 in April/2011, distributed in 23 orders. The abundance and
   richness of the forest differed significantly from the restorative
   technologies in both assessments. The high abundance observed in the
   restorative techniques reflected the dominance of Hymenoptera,
   Coleoptera and Polyxenida. FL showed higher diversity and equitability,
   regardless the sampling season. The PCA separated the forest
   technologies by differences in the composition of the edaphic fauna, and
   the same did not occur between the restoration techniques. In ANOSIM and
   SIMPER the main orders contributing to the forest differentiation of the
   technologies in November/10 were Diptera, Coleoptera, Orthoptera,
   Blattodea, and in April/11 Polyxenida, Hemiptera, Hymenoptera and
   Orthoptera. The edaphic macrofauna was influenced by the degree of
   anthropic interference, being a good indicator of environmental changes
   and ecological succession observed in areas undergoing initial forest
   restoration.},

Title = {Biodiversity recovery of Neotropical secondary forests},
Journal = {SCIENCE ADVANCES},
Year = {2019},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Old-growth tropical forests harbor an immense diversity of tree species
   but are rapidly being cleared, while secondary forests that regrow on
   abandoned agricultural lands increase in extent. We assess how tree
   species richness and composition recover during secondary succession
   across gradients in environmental conditions and anthropogenic
   disturbance in an unprecedented multisite analysis for the Neotropics.
   Secondary forests recover remarkably fast in species richness but slowly
   in species composition. Secondary forests take a median time of five
   decades to recover the species richness of old-growth forest (80\%
   recovery after 20 years) based on rarefaction analysis. Full recovery of
   species composition takes centuries (only 34\% recovery after 20 years).
   A dual strategy that maintains both old-growth forests and species-rich
   secondary forests is therefore crucial for biodiversity conservation in
   human-modified tropical landscapes.},

Abstract = {The Atlantic Forest is a global biodiversity hotspot and a significant
   provider of ecosystem services to 65\% of the Brazilian population. Due
   to being highly threatened, it is protected by federal law 11,428/2006,
   which establishes forest use restrictions based on native vegetation
   successional stages in the Atlantic Forest, with more advanced stages
   receiving more protection. The classification parameters are established
   at the state level. However, the parameters employed to classify forest
   fragments in different successional stages are subjective and imprecise,
   negatively impacting environmental permitting and related offset
   policies. Here, we critically assessed the major limitations in applying
   the 11,428/2006 law and presented alternatives for establishing a more
   transparent, applicable, legally safe, and effective protocol for
   identifying the conservation value of forest fragments. We also
   highlight problems related to sampling, indicators, and methodologies
   and present guidelines for revising the parameters for applying the
   Atlantic Forest law and associated state -level resolutions. We suggest
   an inclusive two-step analysis based on vegetation structure, forest
   cover history, biodiversity, ecosystem services (social), and landscape
   indicators. By employing a more technological approach and transferring
   part of the assessment responsibility to the state -level environmental
   agencies instead of allowing self -declared reports by landowners, our
   proposal focuses on the potential for evaluating ecological integrity
   among different successional classes by forest types. As nearly 90\% of
   the remaining Brazilian Atlantic Forest is located within private lands,
   improving this legal instrument is essential for protecting the
   vulnerable biodiversity of this unique and threatened biome. (c) 2024

Abstract = {How does species choice influence ecological restoration outcomes? In
   order to answer this question, the goal of this study was to assess the
   community structure and species richness of natural regeneration beneath
   the canopy of four native species from the Atlantic Forest (Guarea
   guidonia (L.) Sleumer; Ingo edulis Mart; Nectandra membranacea (SW)
   Griseb; and, Piptadenia gonoacantha (Mart.) J.F. Macbr). The research
   was carried out in plantations of native tree species at the Guapiacu
   Ecological Reserve, in Rio de Janeiro State, Brazil. Our results pointed
   that abundance, basal area and species richness were significantly
   higher beneath Inga compared to Nectandra and Guarea. Whereas the lowest
   values observed in Guarea may suggest its negative effects under natural
   regeneration. Therefore, we highlighted that the positive or negative
   biological effects of tree species, instead of their simple response
   (mortality and initial growth), must be considered in ecological
   restoration projects.},

   regeneration in a preserved tropical landscape},
Journal = {FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {492},
Month = {JUL 15},
Abstract = {To counter increasing CO2 emissions and plant biodiversity loss,
   ecological restoration has been proposed as a means to sequester carbon
   as well as to increase species diversity in tropical landscapes. Here we
   examine how natural regeneration is associated with changing plant
   diversity and carbon stocks in the Atlantic Forest of southern Brazil.
   Aboveground carbon stocks and plant species diversity (using taxonomic,
   functional, phylogenetic and conservation metrics) were estimated in
   areas undergoing natural regeneration, ranging in age from seven to >80
   years. Aboveground carbon, diversity and conservation metrics increase
   rapidly and concomitantly over time during forest natural regeneration,
   but even with carbon increase over time, we found the maximum taxonomic
   and phylogenetic diversity possible for the region. These results show
   the importance of considering regeneration as an alternative to increase
   carbon stocks, diversity, and species conservation in carbon-focused
   restoration plans. Our results showed co-benefits between carbon stocks,
   diversity, and conservation. Diversity (taxonomic, functional, and
   phylogenetic) increases along with carbon stocks, but functional
   evenness does not. Age of the areas also influences co-benefits, as they
   increase over time. Thus, we demonstrate that ecological restoration not
   only sequesters carbon and has benefits with respect to climate change
   but is also responsible for increasing biodiversity and conservation.
   This mutualism between different benefits of natural regeneration
   attends to a variety of international concerns.},

Title = {Post-harvesting silvicultural treatments in logging gaps: A comparison

Abstract = {Despite greatly improved forest management in recent decades, long-term
   assessments show that if current harvesting volumes and cutting cycles
   are maintained, future volume yields of commercial species will
   decrease. A possible solution is to apply post-harvesting silvicultural
   treatments to increase the number of valuable trees. In this study we
   compared during 4 years two treatments: tending naturally established
   seedlings/saplings of commercial species in logging gaps, and enrichment
   planting + tending seedlings of commercial species. In both treatments,
   competition was artificially reduced by liberating each focal
   seedling/sapling from competitors (i.e. other tree seedlings/saplings,
   lianas, or herbs). The experiment was carried out in an area of
   ombrophilous dense forest managed by the Orsa Florestal forestry company
   in jar Valley, eastern Amazon, Brazil (01 degrees 09'S and 52 degrees
   38'W). The company applies reduced-impact logging in a polycyclic
   silvicultural system. We sampled 64 2-year-old logging gaps (average
   area 427.2 m(2)). Thirty-four gaps were used for the planting + tending,
   15 gaps underwent the tending treatment, and there were 15 gaps in the
   control treatment (i.e. no intervention). The tending treatment showed
   lower mortality rate, faster growth rate, and required less liberation
   from overstorey plants and lianas than the other two treatments. Half of
   the species responded positively to tending: the long-lived pioneers
   Goupia glabra and Laetia procera, and the partially shade-tolerant
   Dinizia excelsa, Tachigali myrmecophila, and Trattinnickia sp. Similarly
   to tending, individuals subjected to the enrichment planting + tending
   treatment also presented higher growth rates. Based on these results we
   recommend tending be applied to areas with sufficient natural
   regeneration of commercial species. Enrichment planting + tending should
   be applied when regeneration of commercial species is scare, ideally
   using species that have high initial growth rates, and high commercial
   or conservation value. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Plantation forests and second growth forests are becoming dominant
   components of many tropical forest landscapes. Yet there is little
   information available concerning the consequences of different forestry
   options for biodiversity conservation in the tropics. We sampled the
   leaf-litter herpetofauna of primary, secondary, and Eucalyptus
   plantation forests in the Jari River area of northeastern Brazilian
   Amazonia. We used four complementary sampling techniques, combined
   samples from 2 consecutive years, and collected 1739 leaf-litter
   amphibians (23 species) and 1937 lizards (30 species). We analyzed the
   data for differences among forest types regarding patterns of alpha and
   beta diversity, species-abundance distributions, and community
   structure. Primary rainforest harbored significantly more species, but
   supported a similar abundance of amphibians and lizards compared with
   adjacent areas of second growth forest or plantations. Plantation
   forests were dominated by wide-ranging habitat generalists. Secondary
   forest faunas contained a number of species characteristic of primary
   forest habitat. Amphibian communities in secondary forests and
   Eucalyptus plantations formed a nested subset of primary forest species,
   whereas the species composition of the lizard community in plantations
   was distinct, and was dominated by open-area species. Although
   plantation forests are relatively impoverished, naturally regenerating
   forests can help mitigate some negative effects of deforestation for
   herpetofauna. Nevertheless, secondary forest does not provide a
   substitute for primary forest, and in the absence of further evidence
   from older successional stands, we caution against the optimistic claim
   that natural forest regeneration in abandoned lands will provide refuge
   for the many species that are currently threatened by deforestation.},

Abstract = {The main objectives were to study the effect of gap size and canopy
   openness on the natural regeneration dynamics considering the parameters
   of sapling growth, recruitment, mortality, density, species composition
   and above-ground biomass accumulation. The study was carried out in 32
   artificial gaps with sizes varying from 100 to 1200 m(2) and canopy
   openness from 10 to 45\%, from the second to the twelfth year after gap
   creation. The gap size was measured using the vertical projection of the
   tree crowns on the ground (Brokaw's definition), and the canopy openness
   measurement by hemispherical photography. In the first five years, mean
   sapling growth (0.54 cm year(-1)), mortality (3.9\% year(-1)) and AGB
   (26.2 Mg ha(-1) or 8.7 Mg ha(-1) year(-1)) were significantly higher in
   the gaps than in the forest understorey (0.17 cm year(-1), 1.5\%year(-1)
   and 0.59 Mg ha(-1) year(-1) respectively) and positively correlated with
   gap size and canopy openness. In the same period, recruitment was also
   significantly higher in the gaps (5.8\% year-1) than in the forest
   understorey (0.4\% year(-1)) but decreased with gap size and negatively
   correlated with canopy openness. In the first five years, the relative
   density of pioneer species was higher in the gaps but not significantly
   correlated with gap size or canopy openness. AGB increased linearly
   since canopy opening, and twelve years after gap creation it was still
   higher in larger (121.2 Mg ha(-1) or 10.1 Mg ha(-1) year(-1)) rather
   than smaller (62.5 ha(-1) or 5.2 ha(-1) year(-1)) gaps. Twelve years
   after gap creation there were no significant differences in the
   parameters of sapling growth, recruitment, and mortality which could be
   attributed to the original gap size and canopy openness. (C) 2011

Abstract = {Only 7\% of the once extensive forest along the eastern coast of Brazil

   work to enhance survival and growth of rainforest species on degraded
   pastures composed of highly competitive C-4 grasses. An 8-factor
   experiment was laid out to contrast the value of different intensities
   of cultivation, application of fertilizer and weed control on the growth
   and survival of a mixture of 20 rainforest species planted at two
   densities: 3 m x 1 m, and 3 m x 2 m. Intensive management increased
   seedling survival from 90\% to 98\%, stemwood production and leaf area
   index (LAI) by similar to 4-fold, and stemwood production per unit of
   light absorbed by 30\%. Annual growth in stem biomass was closely
   related to LAI alone (r(2) = 0.93, p < 0.0001), and the regression
   improved further in combination with canopy nitrogen content (r(2)

Abstract = {We used seed rain to monitor a conserved forest and a 5-6-year-old
   forest undergoing natural regeneration after fire. The sampled species
   were classified according to regionality, life forms, dispersal modes,
   and successional stage, and the forests were compared. The type of
   forest and time since disturbance had significant effect on the
   abundance of seeds - 67.3\% being produced in the forest under
   restoration. Biological diversity was higher in the conserved forest. On
   the other hand, species richness was not affected by the type of forest,
   and the species composition was similar between forests. In addition, we
   found similar proportions of life forms, zoochorous species, and
   non-pioneer species in the forests. Our study shows that natural
   regenerating forests can recover different attributes of the seed rain
   in few years when in forest matrices. Thus, to accelerate restoration
   and create trustworthy forests we should conserve the remaining mature
   fragments and use them to facilitate ecological restoration.},

Abstract = {This study aimed to analyze the temporal changes in the floristic
   composition and regeneration structure in a remnant of Mixed
   Ombrophilous Forest that has been without interventions for decades. Two
   surveys were undertaken for the study; the first survey was conducted in
   2012, and the second in 2017. The experimental area comprised 20
   circular plots of 2.5 m radius, where was it performed the
   quantification of the regenerants, measurement of individual tree
   heights, and identification of the ecological group that each surveyed
   species belonged. All individuals with a minimum height of 0.50 m and a
   circumference at breast height of less than 15 cm were measured.
   Approximately 12,382 ind ha(-1 )were found in 2012 and 11,185 ind ha(-1)
   in 2017. Only the following species increased their abundance per
   hectare in 2017 compared to the previous survey: Dalbergia frutescens
   (280.3 ind ha(-1))( )Myrsine coriacea (178.3 ind ha(-1)), Allophylus
   guaraniticus (76.4 ind ha(-1)), Bernadia pulchella (51.0 ind ha(-1)),
   Casearia obliqua (50.9 ind ha(-1)), Casearia decandra (25.5 ind ha(-1)),
   and Luehea divaricata (25.5 ind ha(-1)). The remaining species had a
   negative balance or disappeared from the study. Ecological group
   analysis indicated the gradual replacement of shadow-tolerant climax
   species by pioneer and light-demanding climax species. The most
   representative species identified on both occasions did not undergo
   major changes, indicating that they are more likely to remain in the
   studied area. The results indicated that the studied remnant forest is
   in an advanced phase of succession; however, it presents punctual
   alterations that reflect its floristic and ecological dynamics.},

Abstract = {Mining contributes importantly to tropical deforestation and land
   degradation. To mitigate these effects, mining companies are
   increasingly obliged to restore abandoned mine lands, but factors
   driving restoration success are hardly evaluated. Here, we investigate
   the influence of ecological factors (restoration age, soil properties
   and surrounding forest area) and management factors (diversity and
   density of planted species, mine zone) on the recovery rate of forest
   structure and tree diversity on 40 post-mining restoration areas in
   Southern Amazonia, Brazil, using a 9-year annual monitoring dataset
   consisting of over 25 000 trees. We found that recovery of forest
   structure was closely associated with interactions between soil quality
   and the planted tree communities, and that tree diversity recovery was
   positively associated with the amount of surrounding forests. We also
   observed that forest structure and diversity recover more slowly in mine
   tailings compared to pit surroundings. Our study confirms the complexity
   of mine land restoration but also reveals that planting design and soil
   improvement can increase restoration success. For resource-efficient
   mine restoration, we recommend the focusing of efforts on tailings,
   which are hardest to restore, and reducing efforts in pit surroundings
   and areas close to surrounding forest because of their potential for
   restoration by natural regeneration.This article is part of the theme

Abstract = {Although ecological restoration has entered the global agenda to reverse
   different anthropogenic disturbances, we still know little about how
   this solution interacts with other conservation strategies, to avoid the
   progressive loss of species and ecosystem services. Here we evaluate one
   of the pioneering restoration programs in the southern Brazilian
   Atlantic Forest, where the combination of conservation and restoration
   efforts has been carried out for 20 years. Specifically, we tested how
   landscape characteristics, restoration strategies and environmental
   characteristics affect the results of the restoration of pastures. We
   established 65 circular plots (total 4.0 ha) along restoration areas
   (3-10 years) and sampled trees and shrubs composing the canopy (DBH >= 5
   cm) and understorey (DBH < 5 cm, height > 1.3 m). We analysed the
   landscape metrics (proportion of old-growth forests in 200, 500 and
   1,000 m buffers around each plot; and area and distance of the
   nearest-neighbouring old-growth forests). We explored the multiple
   effects of landscape, restoration strategy (reforestation, natural
   regeneration) and environmental variables (soil, pasture grass types) on
   the species composition and multiple diversity metrics of restoration
   areas. The species composition was very similar among restoration ages
   and restoration strategies. We found positive and strong effects of
   old-growth forest (200 m buffer) proportion on the species richness and
   Shannon diversity (canopy and understorey), above-ground biomass
   (canopy) and functional diversity (understorey) of restoration areas.
   The restoration strategies affected forest structure, and, in general,
   the reforestation strategy increased above-ground biomass, Shannon,
   functional and phylogenetic diversities (in canopy), and percentage of
   endemic species and biomass (understorey), when compared to natural
   regeneration. The 20-year experience in the southern Atlantic Forest
   showed that programs focused on landscape conservation associated with a
   mixture of restoration strategies (i.e. natural regeneration in larger
   areas and active restoration in more disturbed sites), can be an
   efficient strategy to ensure biodiversity and ecosystem services in
   tropical landscapes. Synthesis and applications. To manage degraded
   tropical lands and achieve global targets for biodiversity and ecosystem
   services, it is necessary to first ensure the conservation of natural
   remnants and then use multiple restoration strategies in less resilient
   areas.},

Abstract = {The investigation of natural regeneration after small-scale forest
   management is crucial for understanding the impacts that logging causes
   on the structure and dynamics of the forest. This study evaluated the
   natural regeneration of commercial species exploited in small-scale
   forest management. For this, twenty logging gaps were characterized
   according to size, canopy opening and forest edge height. Then, natural
   regeneration was diagnosed from the identification of commercial species
   (height >= 1.3 m) in nine 2 x 2 m plots. The association between the
   abundance and richness of natural regeneration was tested with Pearson's
   correlation. A total of 205 individuals were found, belonging to 42
   species and 11 families. The species that commonly repeated were Protium
   apiculatum, Protium decandrum and Goupia glabra. Canopy openness was
   positively associated with species abundance and richness, but not with
   species composition. Therefore, there is an abundant and diversified
   regeneration of commercial species in the gaps and the availability of
   light positively affects the number of seedlings and species in
   regeneration. However, species composition in gaps does not depend on
   light availability and must be manipulated via enrichment planting.},

Abstract = {The objective of this research is to show the capacity of P-band
   polarimetric images to define the space of attributes of primary forest
   and secondary succession, through the analysis of the relation among
   backscatter and biomass data (estimated by four specific allometric
   equations). Based on the best fitted regression equation (heat capacity
   model) a biomass map was elaborated. This was done through the
   backscatter image, whose each segment were derived from the thematic
   classification of Bivariate Intensities HH-HV image, with the
   sigmadegrees mean values of each resulting segment converted into
   biomass by the best fit function. As a conclusion, the best allometric
   equations for primary and secondary forest biomass estimation was
   defined, considering the different polarizations of P-band SAR data. The
   advance that was reached with the treatment of P-band data could improve
   the regional monitoring process of the land cover change, a process
   whose speed was accelerated as a result of human action in the Amazon
   during the last two decades.},

Abstract = {Apeiba tibourbou Gaertn and Ochroma pyramidale (Cav. Ex Lam.) Urb. are
   pioneer species from the Malvaceae family commonly found in early
   successional stages, colonizing rapidly abandoned areas in the Amazon
   region. Despite their ecological importance, little is known about them.
   Our objective is to study their populations' structure and spatial
   distribution in secondary forests of different ages and in mature
   forests in southwestern Amazonia, Acre, Brazil. Each site was divided
   into 12 plots (0.72 ha each) where a 100\% inventory was conducted and
   each tree identified and positioned in an X/Y grid. All individuals with
   diameter greater than 5 cm at 1.3 m height were numbered, tagged and
   measured (diameter and height). In total, we found 439 individuals, of
   which 128 (29\%) wee of A. tibourbou and 311 (71\%) of O. pyramidale. We
   also found 9.264 bamboo culms (Guadua weberbaueri Pilger). No individual
   of both species was found in the mature forest plots. We also did not
   find seedlings of either species in any of the plots studied, since
   their seeds can only germinate in direct sunlight. The spatial
   distribution of both species was found to be aggregated and the
   diametrical distribution followed a negative exponential curve shape. No
   association or correlation was found between each species with bamboo
   abundance or with stand age. Such ecological results are important to
   understand these species' occurrence in natural habitats and also in
   reforestation plans and for tree plantations for economic purposes.},

Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {11},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Tree planting and natural regeneration are the main approaches to
   achieve global forest restoration targets, affecting multiple
   hydrological processes, such as infiltration of rainfall. Our
   understanding of the effect of land use history and vegetation on the
   recovery of water infiltration and soil attributes in both restoration
   strategies is limited. Therefore, we investigated the recovery of
   top-soil saturated soil hydraulic conductivity (K-s), soil physical and
   hydraulic properties in five land use types: (i) a secondary old-growth
   forest; (ii) a forest established through assisted passive restoration
   11 years ago; (iii) an actively restored forest, with a more intensive
   land use history and 11 years of age; (iv) a pasture with low-intensity
   use; and (v) a pasture with high-intensity use, in the Brazilian
   Atlantic Forest. For these land use types, we determined the historical
   land use patterns and conducted soil sampling, using the Beerkan method
   to determine K-s values in the field. We also measured tree basal area,
   canopy cover, vegetation height, tree density and species richness in
   forest covers. The K-s decreased when land use was more intense prior to
   forest restoration actions. Our results indicate that land use legacy is
   a crucial factor to explain the current difference in soil and
   vegetation attributes among study sites.},

Title = {Natural regeneration triggers compositional and functional shifts in
   soil seed banks},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {753},
Month = {JAN 20},
Abstract = {Secondary forests emerging during traditional shifting cultivation
   practices are increasingly recognized for their fulfillment of ecosystem
   services and mitigation potential of climate change and biodiversity
   losses. The soil seed bank as a recruit reservoir is a limiting factor
   for natural forest regeneration of such secondary forests and is
   decisive for the formation and restitution of the post-disturbance
   community. The aim of this study was to compare the composition of the
   soil seed bank along a natural regeneration chronosequence from the
   Caxiuana National Forest, eastern Amazon, including old-growth reference
   sites. We sampled standing vegetation, soil properties and soil seed
   banks and compared the density and species richness of different life
   forms among different regeneration stages. Using nonmetric, multiple
   scaling, we compared the composition of the soil seed bank among
   different regeneration stages and with standing vegetation composition.
   Furthermore, we outlined the influence of stand age, vegetation
   structure and soil properties on the density, richness and functional
   characterization of the soil seed bank using mixed effect models. The
   soil seed bank was dominated by herb seeds in all regeneration stages,
   and the density and richness of tree seeds increased with regeneration
   time and recovery of vegetation structure. Seed bank composition changed
   gradually with regeneration advance and differed from standing
   vegetation, containing a high amount of allochthonous seeds, especially
   in older stands. This observation highlights the importance of dispersal
   and habitat connectivity for the natural regeneration of these secondary
   forests. Shifts in soil seed bank composition towards slow-growing,
   animal-dispersed, non-pioneer species with larger, recalcitrant seeds in
   older regeneration stands indicate changes in vegetation composition
   along succession. Thus, our data indicate the importance of connectivity
   for forest regeneration and long fallow periods (> 40 years) to increase
   the performance of ecosystem services, resilience and stability of
   secondary forests arising during shifting cultivation practices. (C)

Abstract = {Forest and landscape restoration (FLR) is a powerful strategy for
   large-scale tropical forest recovery, and payment for ecosystem services
   (PES) is used to support FLR programs and projects on privately-owned
   land. In this article, we discuss the lessons learned from the Water
   Producer Project, a pioneer, multiple-stakeholder, and PES-supported FLR
   project in the Atlantic Forest, south-eastern Brazil. The project was
   implemented in four landscapes located in two municipalities.
   Altogether, 41 PES contracts with landowners were signed, resulting in
   various FLR practices being implemented in a total of 342.4 ha (64.2 ha
   for riparian forest restoration, 90.8 ha for soil conservation, and
   187.4 for forest conservation) of land, which represents 39\% of the
   project goal. As of the end of the project, only 50\% (USD 49,250) of
   the available PES funds had been spent. However, funds spent on project
   planning, implementation, communication, and monitoring were 12 times
   greater than those spent on PES. Several challenges restricted the
   progress and monitoring of the project. The main issue was landowner
   participation and/or engagement. In terms of lessons learned, we
   highlight that PES schemes are more complex than initially thought, and
   that sufficient funding does not guarantee the success of FLR projects.
   It is essential to promote landowner participation and engagement by
   considering them key players in FLR projects. Finally, acceptance from
   landowners was higher and implementation was easier for forest
   conservation practices that required no land-use changes. Thus, we
   suggest that similar future projects should focus on targeting private
   properties in marginal agricultural lands with a high probability of
   natural regeneration. Alternatively, future projects could focus on
   lands with remnant forest cover of high conservation value.},

Year = {2021},
Volume = {59},
Number = {1},
Pages = {2-54},

Abstract = {The Araucaria Mixed Forests (AMF) are subtropical conifer-hardwood mixed
   forests that are part of the Atlantic forest floristic dominion in
   Brazil and Argentina. The AMF is dominated by the coniferAraucaria
   angustifolia(hereafter araucaria), accompanied by a diversity of
   angiosperms. Its distribution largely corresponds to the 13 degrees C
   isotherm and is associated with overall lower temperature, frost-prone,
   and wetter climates than neighboring vegetation types. Palynological
   research and bioclimatic modelling have yielded somewhat conflicting
   results but suggest intense forest-grassland dynamics, with grasslands
   possibly dominating the landscape during the drier and colder last
   glacial maximum. Araucaria is a cultural keystone species whose
   distribution has been greatly fostered by Amerindian activity in the
   last few millennia. Angiosperms form a lower layer beneath araucaria
   canopies, and they seem to be geographically structured into a wetter
   and colder eastern and a drier and hotter western portion. Araucaria
   attain large sizes and high longevity but is unable to regenerate under
   the shade cast by angiosperm canopies and need large-scale disturbances
   for successfully complete their life-cycles. This cycle has been
   synthesised in the non-equilibrium Lozenge model of forest dynamics.
   Regeneration opportunities arise from the frequent multiple treefall
   gaps produced by the tornado and windstorm-prone climate of subtropical
   South America and by the grazing-, fire-, and nurse-plant successional
   dynamics of the forest-grassland mosaic. Dispersal is mediated by a
   complex web of interactions with birds and mammals. A review of the
   dynamics of southern Oceanic Temperate Forests indicates that the
   dynamics of the AMF fits a prevailing pattern in these forests that
   corresponds to the Lozenge model. Deforestation and degradation by
   logging and cattle grazing have impacted most of the AMF original range.
   Similarly to what happened toAgathis australisin New Zealand, the
   establishment of commercial plantations still need incentives and
   research to thrive and produce large-scale environmental benefits.},

Abstract = {Context Despite the importance of secondary forests for the maintenance

   Cecropia hololeuca in the Atlantic Forest of southeastern Brazil. At the
   node level, we analyzed the effects of landscape structure (forest and

   patches, and matrix dominance), topography (slope and elevation), and
   effective population size (Ne) on allelic richness (AR), genetic
   diversity (He) and inbreeding coefficient (f). At the link level, we
   analyzed the effect of four resistance surfaces (isolation by geographic
   distance, land cover, elevation, and slope) on genetic differentiation
   between populations (F-ST, G'(ST), Jost's D). Methods We genotyped 257

   level, we calculated landscape and topographic variables at six spatial
   scales. At the link level, we optimized the resistance surfaces using
   ResistanceGA. We used a model selection approach to select the most
   parsimonious models. Results At the node level, matrices dominated by
   pastures had higher AR than landscapes dominated by Eucalyptus at the
   1500 m spatial scale. At the link level, F-ST was best explained by
   slope, with lower values imposing more resistance. All resistance
   surfaces explained G'(ST). Conclusions In addition to conserving and
   restoring habitats, management practices that improve matrix
   permeability should be adopted to favor the movement of dispersers,
   consequently improving natural regeneration, increasing allelic
   richness, and decreasing genetic differentiation of natural populations.},

Abstract = {Aims Although monodominance has attracted the attention of ecologists
   for many decades, few studies have devoted attention to how abiotic
   factors could influence the occurrence of monodominant forest patches at
   the biome scale. Here, we assessed whether the occurrence of
   monodominant forest patches of Moquiniastrum polymorphum (Less.) G.
   Sancho (Asteraceae), an early-successional tree species with
   wind-dispersed seeds, could be predicted using optimum germination
   temperature and past deforestation. We also verified under what edaphic
   and climatic conditions the species could reach monodominance. Location
   The Atlantic Forest, Brazil. Methods We estimated optimum germination
   temperature across the species' geographic range as a function of annual
   mean temperature based on the results of germination tests available in
   the literature. Past deforestation (a proxy for suitable habitat for the
   species' dispersal and establishment) around monodominant forest patches
   was estimated by calculating the forest cover in 1985. We also modeled
   the upper limit of dominance (relative abundance) as a function of
   climatic and edaphic variables considered important for the species'
   establishment. Results The results showed that the probability of
   occurrence of monodominant forest patches is statistically null in
   places where germination can take more than 10 days and the landscape
   had more than 20\% forest cover. Relative density values for the
   monodominant condition (> 60\%) occurred only in warmer regions with
   infertile soils and median precipitation conditions (ca. 1,075-1,700 mm
   per year) in the Atlantic Forest. Conclusion We conclude that only under
   optimal conditions of germination and dispersal (i.e., regeneration
   niche) does monodominance occur. This highlights germination traits as
   an important mechanism for regulating monodominance. In addition, the
   approach used to predict regions with optimum germination temperature
   has further implications for understanding species abundance and
   distribution more generally.},

Abstract = {In this study we describe a case study to evaluate the floristic
   diversity and the soil conditions of post mined area, currently under
   14-years of restoration. The study area is located in the municipality
   of Descoberto, Minas Gerais State, Brazil, and has one hectare in the
   process of restoration through the planting of seedlings. The forest
   inventory of all individuals with Circumference at Breast Height (CBH)
   >= 15 cm was carried out and the phytosociological parameters were
   evaluated. The study area shows a high floristic diversity H' = 3.258 as
   well as equability (J' = 0.783), evidencing that the study area is
   floristically heterogeneous and has low ecological dominance. In
   addition, this area presented floristic similarity to other restored
   areas that were already in a more advanced restoration process.
   Considering soil quality, the restored study area shows higher levels of
   cation exchange capacity (t), approximate sum base values (SB) and base
   saturation (V) than those verified in nearby areas. Evaluating the
   successional characteristics (greater presence of individuals of
   secondary succession) and the domain of species with dispersion by
   animals, we can infer that the area is in an advanced stage of
   restoration, as well as performing its environmental and social
   functions. Thus, we can conclude that the restoration of mined areas is
   feasible when the restoration techniques are applied correctly.
   Furthermore, we can say that these successful restoration measures are
   improving the environmental sustainability and helping considerably the
   recovery of losses caused by mining.},

Abstract = {Promoting natural regeneration can be a viable strategy to achieve
   ambitious restoration commitments, but predicting where native forest
   cover is likely to expand is challenging. Different biophysical and
   socioeconomic factors may determine the chances of native forest
   regrowth at different spatial and temporal scales, producing complex
   spatial patterns in the landscape and adding more and deeper information
   about potential for different forms of forest restoration. On the basis
   of a systematic literature review including 64 peer-reviewed articles
   from the global tropics and subtropics published from 1990 to 2017, we
   assessed the methodologies employed to remotely detect forest cover
   increase and to identify its biophysical and socioeconomic drivers.
   Automatic classification of multitemporal images and transition matrices
   were the most popular methods to detect areas of forest regrowth,
   whereas regression analysis was the most used analytical approaches to
   assess drivers. Forest cover increased more often on steeper slopes,
   close to forest remnants, inside protected areas, and far from
   population centers. However, the effects of most drivers varied among
   scales of evaluation and may be further affected by the scale of forest
   regrowth. The most influential biophysical and socioeconomic drivers of
   forest cover increase identified here can be used to develop predictive
   models on the likelihood of native forest regrowth to guide the
   implementation of cost-effective tropical forest restoration, thus
   contributing to the mitigation of climate change and species extinction.
   Current remote-sensing literature evaluating forest cover changes seems
   to be largely focused on deforestation dynamics, with little attention
   given to forest cover increase.},

Abstract = {Guadua sarcocarpa and Guadua weberbaueri (Poaceae: Bambuseae) have a
   negative influence on tree regeneration and recruitment in
   bamboo-dominated forests of southwestern Amazonia. The lack of advanced
   regeneration and sparse canopy in this forest type present a
   considerable challenge for developing sustainable timber management
   plans. We conducted field studies in the Porto Dias Agroextractive
   Settlement Project in Acre, Brazil to assess influences of logging in
   bamboo-dominated forest sites. Taxonomic composition, stand structure,
   aboveground biomass, commercial timber volume, and commercial tree
   seedling and bamboo culm density were compared between five logged vs.
   unlogged sites in different landholdings, using modified 0.5 ha Gentry
   plots. No differences in taxonomic composition, aboveground biomass,
   adult and juvenile stem density, or woody seedling and bamboo culm
   density were detected between paired logged and unlogged sites.
   Commercial timber volume, however, was reduced by almost two-thirds in
   logged plots, suggesting that long-term timber management goals in this
   forest type are compromised since so few future crop trees remained
   onsite. Our findings indicate that in order to maximize local management
   objectives, community forest managers must approach logging in
   bamboo-dominated forests with caution. We suggest an integration of
   non-timber forest product extraction with low harvest intensity and
   low-impact logging, tending of natural regeneration, and diversification
   of commercial species. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study is to assess the potential of estimating the
   area, age and changes of tropical secondary forest regrowth from the
   Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM). Sites of mature forest, agriculture,
   pasture, pasture with remnant trees, and stands of secondary forest
   regrowth from 2 to 19 years of age were surveyed in two study areas near
   Manaus, Amazonas, Brazil, and mapped to the TM imagery. Considerable
   changes in spectral reflectance were observed over the first 19 years of
   regrowth, and these can be summarized by indices related to canopy
   brightness and greenness. The near-infrared reflectance, the difference
   index, Kauth-Thomas greenness, and percentage leaf cover all increase
   over the first 4 years after abandonment, peak from 4 to 8 years, and
   decrease from 8 to 13 years. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index
   (NDVI) rapidly rises over the first 4 years, and displays no apparent
   relation to stand age thereafter. The brightness of regrowth canopies
   decreases from 8 to 13 years. Stands from 13 to 19 years-old are
   spectrally similar to mature forest. All regrowth age classes are
   spectrally distinct from agriculture and pasture, and all regrowth age
   classes younger than 14 years are spectrally distinct from mature
   forest. Spectral indices of canopy brightness are significantly
   correlated with regrowth stand age (r(2) less than or equal to 0.48, p <
   0.001). Based on field research in several areas of Amazonia, these
   spectral patterns can be explained in terms of temporal changes in
   canopy geometry and leaf area. The estimated rates of regrowth clearance
   and reversion to regrowth between 1988 and 1991 suggest the intensity of
   rotational agriculture practised by both communities. These results
   suggest that monitoring tropical secondary regrowth with TM imagery
   could substantially improve estimates of carbon sequestration subsequent
   to tropical deforestation.},

Abstract = {Cupressus lusitanica has a relatively low potential for fostering
   colonization of native species beneath the forest canopy. However,
   following the clearcut of a Cupressus lusitanica plantation in the State
   Forest of Avare (SFA), southeastern Brazil, a vigorous regeneration of
   Atlantic forest tree and shrub species was observed. We evaluated the
   passive restoration of this site by comparing its regenerating
   vegetation to the vegetation established in man-made gaps in Atlantic
   forest in the State Park of Cantareira (SPC), southeastern Brazil. The
   frequency distribution of dispersal syndromes for species and the rate
   of reduction in abundance of pioneer species in a rank/abundance plot
   did not differ between the two areas. The rarefaction curves for species
   richness and diversity of the SPC fall below the corresponding curves of
   the SFA. The proportions of non-pioneer species and of individuals of
   non-pioneer species were greater in the SFA. The frequency distribution
   of dispersal syndromes for individuals differed between the two areas
   due mainly to a more conspicuous predominance of zoochory in the SFA.
   The rate of reduction in abundance of non-pioneer species in a
   rank/abundance plot was smaller in the SFA. We concluded that passive
   restoration may successfully recover native vegetation attributes
   following the clearcut of forest plantations without conspicuous
   regeneration of native species beneath the forest canopy. However, this
   phenomenon may be influenced by particular properties of the forest
   species, logging practices and faunal seed dispersal integrity.},

Abstract = {Questions Carbon dynamics in tropical forests is influenced by a variety
   of biotic and abiotic factors that act over temporal and spatial scales.
   At the local scale, carbon stock and dynamics can be determined by the
   environment and ecosystem diversity. Also, during forest regeneration,
   which is a temporal process, it is expected that those factors that
   influence carbon also change over time. Here we examine how carbon stock
   and dynamics are influenced by forest age, environment and functional
   diversity during forest regeneration. Using the relative effects of the
   different drivers of carbon dynamics, we attempt to discern the
   mechanisms (mass effect or niche complementarity) that explain those
   processes.
   Location We carried out this study in Atlantic Forest of different ages
   during natural regeneration in southern Brazil.
   Methods We measured environmental characteristics (soil physical and
   chemical attributes and canopy openness), estimated functional diversity
   and above-ground carbon and its dynamics over time. We examined
   univariate and multivariate predictors of carbon stock and dynamics
   using structural equation models.
   Results We found that age had the strongest influence on carbon stock,
   while environmental characteristics, functional and taxonomic
   diversities were much less important or unimportant. Our results suggest
   that the influence of time on tropical forest carbon dynamics overlaps
   and outweighs the effects due to environmental limits and mechanisms
   mediated by diversity (mass effects, niche complementarity).
   Conclusions Natural regeneration can be an effective strategy for
   restoring carbon sequestration and methods that use manipulation of
   regenerating forests with the hope of improving the process are unlikely
   to bring additional advantage in terms of carbon sequestration.},

Abstract = {Natural regeneration has been proposed as a cost-effective forest
   restoration approach for both small and large-scale initiatives.
   However, attributes for assessing the success of forest restoration
   through natural regeneration may vary among them in spatial patterns
   depending on the scale of analysis and on environmental gradients. Here
   we analysed the spatial patterns of recovery completeness (i.e. how
   similar attributes in restored forests are to the same attributes in
   reference forests) in response to environmental factors in a
   Mediterranean forest landscape of Central Chile. We evaluated (1) forest
   recovery completeness using basal area (BA), quadratic mean diameter
   (QMD), adult species density (ASD), adult species richness (ASR), and
   seedling species richness (SSR); (2) the spatial congruence of recovery
   completeness estimated by each of these indicators; and (3) the
   environmental factors potentially shaping these spatial patterns. We
   used field measurements and geospatial information sources to quantify
   and predict indicator responses by fitting boosted regression tree
   models. To assess the spatial congruence of predictions we overlaid
   high-level recovery completeness values for all indicators. Overall
   recovery completeness in the study area was 72.7\%, suggesting positive
   prospects for attaining fully restored forests. Recovery completeness
   had a resulted higher for diversity (92.3\%-99.6\%) than structural
   forest attributes (33.5\%-76.9\%); however, spatial congruence among
   recovery indicators was low due to the uneven spatial responses of each
   indicator. The maximum potential spatial congruence was < 10\%, and was
   predicted only by two environmental variables (soil bulk density and
   slope). Our results suggest that low spatial congruence among forest
   recovery indicators may hinder the monitoring of restoration at large
   scales. The implications of such divergence in defining restoration
   success can be enormous given the current global challenge of forest
   restoration. Although our research was tested in a threatened region of
   global importance, our results may have wider significance for
   restoration planning providing cautionary notes and recommendations for
   the appropriate use of forest recovery indicators when monitoring
   large-scale restoration projects.},

Abstract = {Riparian forests provide essential ecosystem services to humanity, but
   are being degraded at an accelerated rate in the Amazon. This study
   aimed to quantify carbon stocks above and below ground in riparian
   forests with four levels of degradation (very high, high, medium and
   low) in two watersheds (Pepital Rio and Rio Grande) in Alcantara,
   Eastern Amazon. Twenty-four permanent plots of 1,000 m(2) were
   installed, and vegetation (trees, shrubs, herbs, lianas and palms),
   necromass (litter, dead trees, branches) and soil (0-20 cm and roots)
   were sampled. The biomass was estimated using allometric models
   (vegetation with dbh> 1 cm and dead trees) and destructively
   (herbaceous, litterfall, branches, roots). The total carbon stock in the
   most conserved riparian forests ranged between 88 and 202 Mg(C) ha(-1)
   Degradation significantly reduced carbon stock in all compartments (up
   to 97\% in above-ground biomass, up to 91\% of necromass, and up to 47\%
   in soils). In conserved areas, the aboveground biomass is the largest
   compartment of the total carbon stock (> 70\%), mainly due to large
   trees. The carbon stock in the different compartments are strongly
   correlated with each other and with the canopy opening. The
   incorporation of these results in regional carbon models can assist in
   the implementation and review of the Brazilian Forest Act, particularly
   in the restoration of riparian forests where agriculture is
   consolidated.},

Abstract = {Radar images are presently being used in association with optical remote
   sensing data to characterize the different processes of land use in
   Brazilian Amazon region. Considering the current development in remote
   sensing techniques for estimating forest biomass, where L, X and C band
   images have their limitations, it was recently accomplished a scientific
   airborne mission with image polarimetric P-band imagery acquisition at
   lower Rio Tapajos region, Brazil. This study analyses the biomass
   variation of the primary forest and secondary succession and it's
   influence on the response of backscatter values in the P-band
   polarimetric images. The start of this study was the understanding of
   the behavior of the structural variables of the vegetation cover
   (measured during the field survey) and its' correlation with the
   backscatter data obtained from P-HH-, P-HV- and P-VV- band data. A
   statistical regression model was used to verify the relationship between
   biomass (estimate by different allometric equations) and P-band
   polarimetric data. Based on the regression equation that best fits the
   data sets, a biomass map was elaborated. This was done through the
   segmentation of the backscatter image, using Caesar 3.0 rwseg algorithm
   (based on the successive edge detecting and region growing procedures),
   with the sigmadegrees of each resulting segment was converted into
   biomass values by the best fit function. The final goal of this P-band
   experiment is to improve the regional inventory and monitoring biomass
   dynamics, as well as landscape changes, due to human action in Amazon.},

Abstract = {This study aimed to describe the floristic composition of the

   Araucaria Forest fragment, in South Brazil, in order to infer about the
   process of tree species community assemblage. To do so, five 10 x 20 m
   transection were allocated, in a forest fragment located at municipality
   of Lages, SC state. Each transect was made up by five plots, 20 m from
   each other, subdivided in different sizes, according to the sampled size
   class. The adult and regenerative components were compared each other
   for floristic-structural organization (Permutational Multivariate
   Analysis of Variance and Indicator Species Analysis), richness
   (rarefaction), population, individual spatial distribution (Standardized
   Morisita Index), and pattern of species coexistence or segregation in
   the studied plots (C-score Index). The results demonstrated significant
   differences between adults and regenerating components in relation to
   floristic-structural similarity and to richness. The adult component
   presented a greater proportion of populations with a random spatial
   distribution; and a smaller coexistence of species in plots than the
   regenerative component. We infer that the tree community assemblage is
   under influence of different ecological process, which intensity is
   ontogenetic dependent.},

Abstract = {The difficulty in obtaining young plants with high diversity in forest
   nurseries has caused the loss of biological and genetic diversity in the
   restoration projects of degraded areas. This study presents an
   alternative to minimize this problem by using the technical rescue of
   young plants, which were obtained from two forest patches with different
   stages of ecological succession ( average and initial), located in the
   municipal district of Carandai, MG. Individuals with up to 60 cm heights
   were transplanted to a nursery and evaluated for six months. A total of
   966 individuals belonging to 26 families, totaling 70 different species,
   were rescued with a larger percentage of these being observed in the
   patches with more advanced stages of succession. The average surviva
   lrate was 79.3\%, differing statistically among patches, individuals'
   height and species. Individuals from the initial patch stage, as well as
   those with an inferior height of 40 cm, were characterized by their
   highest survival level. A high level of plant survival could be
   verified, both pioneer and non-pioneer species, many of them not
   commonly found in forest nurseries and, consequently, also absent in the
   restoration projects. Therefore, the technical rescue of young plants is
   a viable complementary strategy, with low cost, which can contribute to
   the increasing of diversity in forest nurseries and in forest
   restoration projects.},

Journal = {COMMUNITY ECOLOGY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {17},

Pages = {88-97},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Changes in species composition during the succession of ecological
   communities potentially reflect the differential effects of
   environmental filters and limiting similarity on structuring
   communities. As ecological succession can represent community assembly
   in action, understanding how successional time affects the functional
   and phylogenetic structure of communities can reveal the influence of
   different factors on the assembly process. We analysed functional
   patterns of multiple traits related to the succession of tropical
   forests to answer if there are trait convergence and/or divergence with
   regeneration age, and if functional and phylogenetic diversity can be
   predicted by forest age. We compiled checklists from studies of 23
   successional forests in Brazilian Atlantic Forest, ranging from 4 to 120
   years old. We also compiled functional traits for a total of 355
   species. We analysed the data by a method that includes scaling-up
   trait-based data to the community level and matrix correlations of
   multiple traits. We built linear models to show the relationship between
   each trait and diversity (taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic) with
   successional time. We found no phylogenetic signal at the species pool
   and metacommunity levels, but significant trait divergence (tree guild,
   leaf slenderness, leaf area, pollination entomo-philous generalist and
   pollination by vertebrate) and trait convergence (arboreal habitus, tree
   guild, leaf compoundness, pollination entomophilous generalist) patterns
   related to the successional gradient. Also, functional diversity
   increased during succession, with a significant increase in leaf
   slenderness and zoochoric dispersal and decrease in tree guild.
   Phylogenetic diversity also increased along the successional gradient.
   We found that the communities in the studied successional gradient are
   structured by both environmental (measured by trait convergence) and
   biotic (measured by trait divergence) filtering. The species turnover
   and diversification at taxonomic level are followed by well-defined
   patterns of trait turnover, revealing that community assembly is
   constrained by environmental filters at the beginning and by limiting
   similarity at the advanced stages of the succession.},

Abstract = {Tropical forests have a great potential for the exploitation of natural
   resources. Among the economic activities that depend on forest
   resources, timber production is the most important one. Nevertheless,
   these activities may negatively affect wildlife, the availability of
   natural resources, and ecosystem process. Here we analysed the effects
   of low-impact logging on understory bird species richness, number of
   individuals captured, species composition, and assemblage structure in
   central Brazilian Amazon. We compared logged and unlogged areas over a
   period of three years (from August 2014 to May 2017). We captured a
   total of 180 birds and 42 species (20 families) in the logged area and
   226 birds and 49 species (20 families) in the unlogged area. Bird
   assemblage structure in the logged area changed more intensely over the
   three years of study and became more similar to the assemblage found in
   the unlogged area. The degree of similarity (Jaccard's index) in species
   composition between logged and unlogged areas increased from 18\% in the
   third year to 39\% in the fifth year after logging. The results suggest
   that the minor effects of low-impact logging were reduced a few years
   after the disturbance, probably due to ecological succession. The
   proximity of logged and unlogged areas and the reduced impact in the
   study site may facilitate the recovery of the bird assemblage after the
   disturbance.},

Journal = {FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2002},
Volume = {163},

Abstract = {Large areas of primary forest in Amazonia have been cleared for cropping
   or pasture, thereby releasing carbon into the atmosphere. Part of this
   carbon is re-assimilated by secondary forest after the land has been
   abandoned. Agroforestry and tree crop plantations are options for the
   economic valorization of previously cleared land in the humid tropics
   however, for evaluating the consequences of these land uses for regional
   carbon flows when established on secondary forest land, information is
   needed on carbon accumulation in the biomass and soil of these land use
   systems and of the successional vegetation that they replace. Above- and
   belowground biomass and litter accumulation were measured for three
   multistrata. agroforestry systems and five tree crop monocultures seven
   years after their establishment on secondary forest land on a xanthic
   Ferralsol in central Amazonia. The biomass of the tree crop systems was
   compared with that of the 14-year-old secondary forest that would have
   covered the area in their absense. The agroforestry systems were studied
   at two fertilization levels. Allometric relationships were developed for
   estimating the aboveground biomass of eight tree crop species, and root
   systems were excavated to determine root-shoot-ratios. Depending on
   species composition and fertilizer input, the multistrata systems had an
   aboveground biomass of 13.2-42.3 t per ha, a belowground biomass of
   4.3-12.9 t per ha, and a litter mass of 2.3-7.2 t per ha. The
   monocultures had an aboveground biomass of 7.7-56.7 t per ha, a root
   biomass of 3.2-17.1 t per ha and a litter mass of 1.9-5.6 t per ha. The
   combined biomass and litter was highest in the peach palm for fruit
   (Bactris gasipaes) monoculture, followed by two of the multistrata
   systems. The 14-year-old secondary forest had a combined biomass and
   litter stock of 127 t per ha. The soil carbon stocks tended to be lower
   in the agricultural systems than under adjacent primary forest in the
   topsoil, but not when summed over the soil profile to 2 in depth.
   Multistrata agroforestry had several advantages over monocultures as it
   allowed to combine high and long-term biomass accumulation with early
   generation of income from annual and semiperennial intercrops, increased
   growth and earlier yields of certain tree crops, long-term accumulation
   of capital in larger trees, and more complete occupation of the soil
   than in common tree crop monocultures of the region. Trees with low
   litter quality seemed to have a favourable effect on soil carbon even
   when associated with species with high litter quality and could be used
   as an insurance against soil organic matter loss under tree crop
   agriculture. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Property size and forest cover were key determinants of forest
   restoration in Southern Bahia in the Atlantic Forest of Brazil},
Journal = {LAND USE POLICY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {134},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Forest restoration has gained traction as a solution to mitigate climate
   change, contribute to biodiversity conservation, and support forest
   livelihoods. Yet there is limited evidence on the spatial locations
   where restoration is most likely to occur. In landscapes that primarily
   contain private properties, assessing the likelihood of restoration can
   be informed by understanding the enabling and limiting factors that have
   influenced propertylevel restoration in the past. In this paper, we
   tested the relationships between restoration, property size, and forest
   cover, for 8451 properties between 1985 and 2019 in Southern Bahia,
   Atlantic Forest, Brazil. We found that spatial property-level variables
   were strongly associated with restoration. First, we found that property
   size was positively correlated with the amount of restoration per
   property. Medium-sized properties (between 40 and 127 ha) accounted for
   the most restoration in aggregate. Second, we found that properties with
   less forest cover were associated with higher amounts of restoration. In
   addition, for properties larger than 20 ha, those with intermediate
   amounts of forest cover had high amounts of restoration. Third, we found
   that restoration was a spatial process that occurred in hotspots rather
   than randomly across the study landscape, indicating that restoration
   often occurred near to other restored properties. Understanding these
   relationships may assist restoration planners in making more informed
   estimates of the conditions that might enable future restoration. Given
   that restoration is a complex process that may require different
   approaches in different socioenvironmental contexts, decision-makers may
   consider identifying and prioritizing properties of different sizes and
   with different amounts of forest cover depending on their specific
   priorities, landscape-level conditions, and restoration context. Our
   spatial analysis techniques assist in improving broader understanding of
   possible ways in which land use policy could prioritize for restoration
   at the property level and could later be applied to other
   socio-environmental tropical forest systems.},

Abstract = {Native tree plantation is one of the most common ecological restoration
   techniques used in tropical forests since it catalyzes ecological
   succession and contributes to the recovery of ecosystem processes. This
   study assessed the effect of functional trait composition (leaf area,
   specific leaf area, leaf dry matter content, leaf P, leaf C, leaf N, and
   wood density), functional diversity (functional richness, functional
   evenness, functional divergence, and Rao entropy), and aboveground
   biomass on soil properties in communities undergoing ecological
   restoration in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. The experiment was
   conducted in a native tree plantation with four treatments based on
   ecological species groups that were implemented 19 years ago. Structural
   equation models were used to assess the role of vegetation attributes
   (trait composition, functional diversity, and aboveground biomass) on
   soil properties (chemical properties, respiration, and microbial
   enzymatic activity). Our results showed that trait composition was a
   more important driver of changes in soil properties than functional
   diversity or aboveground biomass. The community-weight mean (CWM) of
   specific leaf area was negatively associated with soil carbon (-0.63)
   and soil microbial enzymatic activity (-0.77) and positively related to
   soil phosphorous content (0.72). Functional diversity (Rao entropy
   index) was negatively correlated with carbon microbial biomass (-0.89).
   Aboveground biomass alone did not explain changes in soil ecosystem
   processes. These results underscore the significance of using plant
   functional traits as an integrated tool to evaluate the links between
   below and aboveground components in restoration sites of tropical
   forests.},

Abstract = {The vegetation of the forests edge shows characteristics of early
   succession stages. However, this initial stage forest produce leaves
   that are hard to decompose and have a lower diversity of the soil
   invertebrates that participate in litter decomposition. Thus, it is
   likely that the litter decomposition and soil fauna are influenced by
   the newly created fragments border characteristics. The aim of this
   study was to evaluate the litter decomposition and soil invertebrates in
   a Atlantic Rain Forest fragment located in Pinheiral, RJ, Brazil. Litter
   bags and pitfall traps were installed at the edge and in the interior of
   the forest to assess the loss of litter mass and the soil fauna,
   respectively. The litter decomposed more slowly on the edge, where the
   soil fauna was less diverse and with more expression of bacteria and
   fungi predators. On the forest interior, with greater soil fauna
   diversity and higher activity of decomposers and predators
   invertebrates, litter decomposition showed a tendency to be faster.
   Accordingly, the fragmentation in secondary forests may slow the dynamic
   of litter decomposition and, thus, alter the nutrient cycling in the
   upper soil layer.},

Pages = {772-779},
Abstract = {Forest restoration projects are usually planted with a reduced number of
   species as compared to standing forests, largely due to the low
   availability of native species in seedling nurseries. In the present
   study, the potential of the native seedling community as a source of
   seedlings for forest restoration is analyzed. To do so, the seedling
   community from a forest fragment located in the southeast of Brazil was
   evaluated. Individuals (tree and shrub species) up to 30 cm height were
   measured and identified in 20 4 x 4 m plots. Altogether, 6,136
   individuals (17 individuals m(-2)) belonging to 119 species were
   sampled. The seedling community showed a spatial heterogeneity with
   respect to the density of individuals and composition of species, and
   also a spatial aggregation for the 10 most abundant species. Several
   species that occurred in high densities in the seedling community are
   not presently available in regional forest nurseries and are therefore
   not used in restoration projects. This result and the high number of
   individuals and species found in the fragment suggest a great potential
   of this type of forest remnants as a source of highly diverse seedling
   banks for use in restoration projects.},

Journal = {REVISTA ARVORE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {44},
Abstract = {Through the variation of the functional attributes, it is possible to
   verify the functioning of an ecosystem, both by the species organization
   as by their responses to the environmental variations. In this sense,
   the objective of this study was to analyze the ecological strategies of
   the main tree species by analyzing their functional attributes. PCoA was
   used to verify which species are acquisitive and conservative;
   clustering was used to verify the functional attributes by groups; the
   Pearson's correlation between the functional attributes and a CWM-RDA
   analysis was used to verify the environmental variables. Most species
   were classified as light-demanding climax and having zoochoric
   dispersion. The species presented phenotypic plasticity as an important
   ecological strategy in the composition of their functional attributes,
   especially when related to leaf area and specific leaf area. Most of the
   species belonged to the acquisitive group. The acquisitive and
   conservative groups indicate the resilience potential of the tree
   community and the change processes in ecological succession. There was a
   strong negative correlation between the leaf attributes, and a positive
   one with diameter and height, both correlations related to plant growth
   and development. Of the environmental variables only pH, K, and average
   elevation, were related to the attributes, indicating that environmental
   conditions are important for the establishment of the sampled species.
   Also, it was found that the species composition is linked to several
   conditions of ecological strategies associated with changes in the
   environment.},

   multijuga var. verrucosa (Vogel) H.S. Irwin \& R.C. Barneby) at two
   spacings (2 x 2 and 3 x 3 m) in facilitating natural regeneration in
   areas undergoing forest restoration in southeastern Brazil. Circular
   plots were established under the canopies of each individual of these
   species and in open areas. All regenerating tree species were counted
   and identified. Joannesia princeps and S. multijuga var. verrucosa
   supported a greater richness of species under their canopy compared to
   the control area, but did not differ from the other species. The
   richness of regenerating trees under Bixa arborea and Inga laurina
   canopy did not differ from the control area. A greater abundance of
   regenerating trees was found below Inga laurina, Joannesia princeps and
   S. multijuga var. verrucosa. Trees planted at 2 x 2 m spacing sheltered
   a greater richness of regenerating tree species than at 3 x 3 m spacing.
   The species Joannesia princeps and S. multijuga var. verrucosa and the
   use of 2 x 2 m spacing are therefore recommended for accelerating the
   natural succession of degraded areas. Knowledge of the best combinations
   of species and spacing schemes to use to restore Atlantic rain forest is

Abstract = {The Caatinga, the largest region of seasonally dry tropical forest in
   the Neotropics, suffers high rates of deforestation and habitat
   degradation, mostly due to wood extraction. As an alternative to illegal
   logging, governments have looked at more sustainable management schemes,
   allowing natural regeneration after logging through relatively long
   (similar to 25-year) harvest rotations. We investigated the impacts of
   forest management at a 1,700-ha privately owned area located at the
   Araripe Plateau, in the semiarid interior of northeastern Brazil,
   focusing on the population parameters of 8 avian species. The property
   was subdivided into 22 forest stands, where a different stand has been
   logged every year since 2004. By 2016, when we sampled the avifauna, 12
   forest stands had already been logged and allowed to regrow, creating a
   landscape of logged and unlogged stands and a 12-year forest recovery
   chrono-sequence. We conducted distance-based sampling along transects to
   estimate the density and abundance of these species in logged and
   unlogged stands. We found that logging impacted 3 of the target species.
   Two of them (Megaxenops parnaguae and Synallaxis scutata) were less
   abundant, whereas another (Sclerurus cearensis) disappeared altogether
   from logged areas. We also found a positive correlation between the
   normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and the avian density of
   the affected species. However, we failed to observe any significant
   relationship between forest recovery or NDVI and species densities,
   suggesting that even after 12 years of forest recovery, species
   abundance remains lower in logged than in unlogged areas. We found that
   logging impacted birds in a species-specific manner, with 5 species
   unaffected and 3 species declining. Although our sampling occurred
   half-way through the regeneration cycle, we found no evidence of
   recovery for those species most affected. We suggest keeping unlogged
   areas intermingled with logged stands, allowing the survival and
   potential recovery of species in regenerating forests.},

Abstract = {In tropical systems, habitat heterogeneity and resource availability
   have been reported as important factors driving ant species richness and
   composition. For this reason, these variables have been widely used as
   indicators of forest disturbance. The aim of this study was to compare
   the composition and richness of arboreal ants between the dry and wet
   seasons in three successional stages of a tropical dry forest at the
   Parque Estadual da Mata Seca, northern Minas Gerais state, Brazil. Ant
   sampling was performed in 15 plots in three different forest secondary
   stages: early, intermediate and late. Ants were sampled during the wet
   and dry seasons, using five pitfall traps per plot. We collected 43 ant
   species, distributed in 19 genera. Our results indicated a change on ant
   species composition along the successional gradient (p < 0.05). However,
   ant species richness did not differ between stages and seasons (p >
   0.05) and was not affected by the variables used here as surrogates to
   habitat heterogeneity (tree richness) and resource availability (tree
   density) (p > 0.05). Ant composition did not change significantly
   between the dry and wet seasons for the early successional stage, but
   plots from the intermediate and late stages were clearly segregated
   according to seasons. We suggest that it is likely that 25 years of
   forest regeneration are enough to restore most of the arboreal ant
   communities in tropical dry forests, strengthening the importance of
   secondary habitats to biodiversity maintenance.},

Abstract = {Ecosystem entropy production is predicted to increase along ecological

   studies have bridged the gap between theory and data. Here, we explore
   radiative entropy production in terrestrial ecosystems using
   measurements from 64 Free/Fair-Use sites in the FLUXNET database,
   including a successional chronosequence in the Duke Forest in the
   southeastern United States. Ecosystem radiative entropy production
   increased then decreased as succession progressed in the Duke Forest
   ecosystems, and did not exceed 95\% of the calculated empirical maximum
   entropy production in the FLUXNET study sites. Forest vegetation,
   especially evergreen needleleaf forests characterized by low shortwave
   albedo and close coupling to the atmosphere, had a significantly higher
   ratio of radiative entropy production to the empirical maximum entropy
   production than did croplands and grasslands. Our results demonstrate
   that ecosystems approach, but do not reach, maximum entropy production
   and that the relationship between succession and entropy production
   depends on vegetation characteristics. Future studies should investigate
   how natural disturbances and anthropogenic management-especially the
   tendency to shift vegetation to an earlier successional state-alter
   energy flux and entropy production at the surface-atmosphere interface.},

   about the potential of different reforestation methods to achieve these
   objectives. Based on this gap, we assessed the ecological outcomes and
   local livelihood benefits of community-managed agroforests and second
   growth forests to assist natural regeneration in the coastal Atlantic
   Forest of Brazil. We investigated and compared agroforests and secondary
   forests according to their structure and floristic composition in 51
   circular plots of 314 m(2), their role in supporting local livelihoods
   (45 semi-structured interviews) and the use and cultural importance of
   plant species (61 interviews). Agroforests and, more remarkably, managed
   secondary forests (1) re-established a well-developed forest structure,
   with a higher density of tree-sized individuals and similar basal area
   compared to nearby old growth forests; (2) were composed by a rich array
   of native species, including five threatened species, but had lower
   species richness than old growth remnants; and (3) improved local
   livelihoods by supplying market valuable and culturally important
   plants, including 231 native ethnospecies. Overall, local production
   systems showed remarkable potential to engage smallholders of developing
   tropical countries in Forest and Landscape Restoration and contribute to
   achieve its overall goals. We advocate the promotion of these systems as
   effective Forest and Landscape Restoration approaches in multi-scale
   programs and policies.

Abstract = {Aims
   Assessing the role of a dominant native bamboo species on tree species
   diversity and structure in the medium term.
   Methods
   Over a 7-year period, we studied the natural regeneration of two
   dominant forest types in Southern Brazil (Araucaria Forest or AF; Bamboo
   Forest or BF) after a bamboo (Merostachys skvortzovii Send.) die-off
   between 2004 and 2006. The study was carried out in the Embrapa Research
   Station in Cacador, Santa Catarina State, Brazil.
   Important Findings
   The die-off provided ideal conditions for the establishment of several
   species and it kickstarted forest succession dynamics, which in turn
   affected regeneration diversity. Tree species richness was relatively
   stable with a transitory increase between 2007 and 2014 in both AF and
   BF. However, species richness rose in BF because of a relative increase
   in abundance of some species (especially late and secondary species)
   while a plunge in some pioneer species drove an increase in diversity.
   Overall, we found that BF has a lower diversity of recruits and that
   density declined over time, while AF is more diverse, with a more stable
   density. In BF, the bamboo die-off created optimal conditions for
   initial regeneration development (mainly fast-growing pioneer trees),
   which quickly transited to higher size classes. Yet, after this initial
   stage of pioneer recruitment, the number of recruits dropped followed by
   a virtual absence of growth regardless of the species group as a result
   of a quick bamboo reestablishment. As bamboo recreated a dense
   understory it reduced species diversity to original levels, suggesting a
   self-maintaining cycle that halts forest succession. On the other hand,
   the bamboo die-off had little impact on AF where a slow recruitment
   process typical of old-growth forests was observed. The results indicate
   that the die-off event had a temporary effect on species diversity i.e.
   restricted to forests where bamboos are dominant in a similar process
   described in other southern South American forests. As the first study
   to observe the medium-term forest dynamics related to bamboo die-off, we
   can conclude that when being dominant, native bamboos can hinder forest
   regeneration, maintaining lower levels of diversity and arresting forest
   succession that lasts well beyond the short-term, post-die-off effects.
   Many forest fragments in the region are dominated by bamboos, thus their
   potential for conservation is at risk and requires appropriate
   management.},

Abstract = {BackgroundThis study aimed to determine the influence of soil traits,
   vegetation structure and climate on litterfall dynamics along a
   successional gradient in a tropical dry forest (TDF) in southeastern
   Brazil. We used a chronosequence design consisting of three successional
   stages (early, intermediate, and old-growth) defined based on forest age
   and vertical and horizontal structures.MethodsLitterfall was recorded
   monthly for three years in 12 plots of 50x20m (four plots per stage)
   where vegetation parameters (species richness, basal area, density and
   height for trees with diameter at breast height >= 5cm) and soil
   chemical and physical traits were previously obtained. We placed eight
   0.5-m(2) litter traps in each plot, totalling 96 traps. Samples were
   sorted into leaves, twigs, reproductive parts, and
   debris.ResultsLitterfall mass was composed mainly of leaves and varied
   slightly among years (4 to 4.5Mg.ha(-1)), within the range observed for
   other TDFs. Annual litterfall mass was higher at the old-growth forest
   than at the early and intermediate forest stages and this successional
   pattern was driven by vegetation characteristics (forest structural
   parameters and plant functional groups) and soil traits related to
   water-holding capacity. Litter amount in the intermediate stage was
   lower than expected for its forest structure (and similar to the early
   stage), possibly because its higher soil clay content increased the
   water holding capacity and leaf retention during the dry season.
   Seasonal variations in monthly litterfall were strongly driven by forest
   deciduousness and affected by climatic factors related to water
   availability. This pattern was consistent across the successional
   gradient, although differences for each litterfall component were
   observed.ConclusionsOur results suggest that litter production in the
   studied TDF is influenced by multiple factors along succession, such as
   above-ground biomass and the degree of leaf retention mediated by soil
   water-holding capacity. Further studies on community phenological
   patterns can allow a better understanding of successional changes on
   litterfall and how fast this fundamental function recovers in secondary
   forests.},

Abstract = {The use of a forest seedling bank has been recommended as an alternative
   to increase species richness in forest nurseries, as well as to produce
   seedlings of species that are difficult to propagate, especially those
   that belong to the late secondary and climax successional groups, which
   are not as commercially available. However, little is known about the
   impact of this method on forest dynamics. Thus, the present study aimed
   to examine the resilience and dynamics of a seedling bank in a remnant
   of a subtropical seasonal forest belonging to the Atlantic Forest Biome
   when subjected to different intensities of seedling removal. The
   experiment was conducted in a random block design in a factorial scheme
   (5 x 4), with treatments composed of five intensities of removal of
   individuals from the seedling bank and the four seasons. The treatments
   were distributed into 18 blocks and the experimental units were composed
   of 1 m x 2.5 m plots. The resilience of the seedling community was
   assessed by examining effects of the five removal intensities. The
   dynamics between the evaluation periods within each treatment were
   verified by comparing the number of species and seedlings present before
   the treatments with those in the other evaluation periods. After one
   year, we found that tree-shrub vegetation had a partial capacity for
   restoration after withdrawal of individuals from the seedling bank. Our
   results show that the impact on the regeneration community can absorb
   the effects of up to 25\% seedling removal. The technique of seedling
   transplantation may be recommended for species that have abundant
   regeneration, such as Actinostemon concolor, Eugenia rostrifolia,
   Trichilia claussenii and Nectandra megapotamica.},

   elevational transects (900-1,800 m above sea level) on three mountains.
   Transects were sampled 11-12 times on each mountain to evaluate how
   local species richness is influenced by mountain region, vegetation
   type, and elevational zones. Patterns were also analyzed for the
   subfamilies, and after disregarding species that exhibit hilltopping
   behavior. Species richness was evaluated by the observed richness,
   Jacknife2 estimator and Chao 1 estimator standardized by sample
   coverage. Overall, 155 species were collected, but extrapolation
   algorithms suggest a regional richness of about 220 species. Species
   richness was far higher in forest than in early successional vegetation
   or grassland. Richness decreased with elevation, and was higher on
   Anhangava mountain compared with the two others. Patterns were similar
   between observed and extrapolated Jacknife2 richness, but vegetation
   type and mountain richness became altered using sample coverage
   standardization. Hilltopping species were more easily detected than
   species that do not show this behavior; however, their inclusion did
   neither affect estimated richness nor modify the shape of the species
   accumulation curve. This is the first contribution to systematically
   study highland butterflies in southern Brazil where all records above

   functional diversity indices were similar between planted and
   regenerating, with the exception of functional dispersion, although
   Minas do Leao presents low functional richness (0.13). This indicates
   that even with lower species richness and lower functional richness in
   planting does not imply lower species richness and lower functional
   richness of regenerants. Applied nucleation can be an efficient method

Abstract = {Hedychium coronarium J.Koenig is a rhizomatous herbaceous species native
   to Asia and invasive in most states of Brazil. We aimed to evaluate the
   influence of H. coronarium on terrestrial herbaceous communities and
   natural regeneration of woody plants in a remnant of Alluvial Araucaria
   Forest in Curitiba - PR. The communities were sampled considering two
   treatments: (EC) high coverage of H. coronarium (>60\%); (BC) low
   coverage of H. coronarium (<30\%). Two communities were recorded: i)
   herbaceous vascular species (including subshrubs) and ii) seedlings of
   woody species between 15130 cm height. In EC H. coronarium had an
   average cover of 78.06\%, with only five native herbaceous species and
   24 native woody species. The average cover of the invasive in BC was
   6.29\%, with 17 native herbaceous and 37 woody native species. The most
   representative native herbaceous was Christella dentata (Forssk.)
   Brownsey \& Jermy, while among the woody species Myrcia selloi (Spreng.)
   N.Silveira stood out for its frequency and abundance. The abundance of
   woody plants in the EC was approximately four times less than in the BC,
   showing that the high density of H. coronarium negatively influences
   native plant communities. The high cover of the invasive species results
   in a decrease in species richness and the number of individuals in the

Title = {Time-course of photosynthetic induction in four tropical woody species
   grown in contrasting irradiance habitats},
Journal = {PHOTOSYNTHETICA},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {46},
Number = {3},
Pages = {431-440},

Abstract = {We investigated the photosynthetic induction time-course in species of
   different ecological groups grown in contrasting forest irradiance
   environments, gap and understorey, exposed to different darkness times
   in order to verify the plant capacity to exploit irradiance
   heterogeneity. Photosynthetic induction was studied in leaves of
   Bauhinia forficata and Guazuma ulmifolia (early succession species, ES),
   and Esenbeckia leiocarpa and Hymenaea courbaril (late succession
   species, LS). T-50 and T-90 (time estimates to attain 50 and 90 \% of
   maximum net photosynthetic rate, respectively) varied according to the
   time of previous exposure to darkness and growth irradiance. In both
   darkness times of 10 and 30 min, T-50 was lower in the LS-than
   ES-species. These results, jointly with significant higher induction
   state of the leaves after 10 min of darkness, suggest that the
   LS-species has a higher potential to sunfleck utilization compared to
   ES-species, both grown in the understorey. After 10 and 30 min of
   darkness the differences between ecological groups were not clearly
   detected in the gap for T-50 and T-90, indicating that eco-physiological
   characteristics of each ecological group did not influence the induction
   time of the species evaluated herein. Thus the capacity to show
   phenotypic plasticity is not exclusive to an ecological group, but it is
   rather a more intrinsic feature related to the differential capacity of
   individuals.},

Title = {Rainfall and sea level drove the expansion of seasonally flooded
   habitats and associated bird populations across Amazonia},
Journal = {NATURE COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {13},
Number = {1},
Month = {AUG 23},
Abstract = {This study found that millennial periods of higher rainfall combined
   with rising sea level enhanced sediment accumulation in Amazonian rivers
   valleys. This fuelled synchronous expansion of vegetation adapted to
   seasonally flooded substrates and its specialized bird populations,
   showing how global climate changes can affect specific Amazonian
   species.
   Spatial arrangement of distinct Amazonian environments through time and
   its effect on specialized biota remain poorly known, fueling
   long-lasting debates about drivers of biotic diversification. We address
   the late Quaternary sediment deposition that assembled the world's
   largest seasonally flooded ecosystems. Genome sequencing was used to
   reconstruct the demographic history of bird species specialized in
   either early successional vegetation or mature floodplain forests.
   Sediment deposition that built seasonally flooded habitats accelerated
   throughout the Holocene (last 11,700 years) under sea level highstand
   and intensification of the South American Monsoon, at the same time as
   global increases in atmospheric methane concentration. Bird populations
   adapted to seasonally flooded habitats expanded due to enlargement of
   Amazonian river floodplains and archipelagos. Our findings suggest that
   the diversification of the biota specialized in seasonally flooded
   habitats is coupled to sedimentary budget changes of large rivers, which
   rely on combined effects of sea level and rainfall variations.},

Abstract = {Tropical dry forests are among the most threatened ecosystems in the
   world. After habitat perturbation occurs, the habitat recovers naturally
   through ecological succession. This succession can modify functional
   attributes of plants, which in turn, can affect herbivorous insects'
   performance. We analyzed morphological, functional, and chemical traits
   associated with herbivory patterns in Croton roxanae and C. suberosus,
   that occur in mature and secondary forests in the tropical dry forest of
   Chamela, Jalisco. Leaf area and leaf thickness were higher in secondary
   forest, while leaf density and fresh leaf mass were higher in mature
   forest. Dry leaf mass, specific leaf area, chlorophyll content, and
   water content showed variation between species in both forest
   conditions. The concentration of secondary metabolites showed variation
   between species and forest conditions. Croton roxanae showed higher
   herbivory in mature forest, and C. suberosus did not show differences
   between the two conditions. Leaves in secondary forest were slightly
   longer and broader than leaves in mature forest. Croton species showed
   higher fluctuating asymmetry in secondary forest. Herbivory was not
   associated with levels of fluctuating asymmetry levels in both Croton
   species. Our results suggest that plant attributes are influenced by
   forest condition, which in turn, indirectly affect the attack of
   herbivores.},

Abstract = {Changes in the horizontal structure of a fragment of Mixed Rain Forest,
   located at Irati National Forest, in Parana state, were evaluated by
   measurements performed during the years 2002, 2005 and 2008. The study
   area has 25 ha, divided into 25 permanent sample plots of 1 ha (100 m x
   100 m) each. All trees with diameter at 1,30 m above the ground equal or
   higher 10 cm were measured and identified. Density, dominance,
   frequency, importance value and cover value were analyzed and, to
   understand better the phytosociological estimators and successional
   stage of the forest, the species were classified into ecophysiological
   groups: pioneers, early secondary, late secondary and undetermined.
   There was a decrease of 2.3\% in the number of individuals per hectare,
   with 581 recorded in 2002 and 567 individuals/ha in 2008. Currently,
   Ilex paraguariensis was the species with the greatest number of
   individuals, representing 9.4\% of the total. The dominance (basal area)
   changed from 28.6 in 2002 to 30.2 m(2)/ha in 2008, i.e., there was an
   increase of 5.1\% in the period, and currently Araucaria angustifolia
   has been the species that dominates the forest with 25.9\%. The
   frequency pointed to an uneven distribution of species in the forest,
   with rates of 47,4\% in 2002 and 46,3\% in 2008. Araucaria angustifolia
   was the dominant species and the most ecologically important one in the
   period with 35.2 (11.7\%) of the total absolute importance value in
   2008. According to the phytosociological estimators and ecophysiological
   groups the forest still has a growing stock, due to the increment in
   trees with bigger diameters from species such as Araucaria angustifolia
   and Ocotea porosa, and is in advanced stage of ecological succession,
   with the majority of species and individuals belonging to the early and
   late secondary, and every year it becomes more mature with the ingress
   of new species and shade tolerant individuals.},

   altitudinal gradient and across seasons, and to analyse the floristic
   links between the forest soil seed bank, seed rain, regeneration layer
   and adult tree layer. The seed bank data were collected in the dry and

   species lists derived from previous studies at these same locations. The
   results showed seed density and species richness varied among different
   elevations, but did not vary with gradient. Seed bank density and
   richness varied significantly across seasons, with the highest averages
   found in the rainy season. In the floristic composition, the higher
   elevations showed more similar composition than to the lower elevations.
   Seed bank composition was floristically different from the seed rain,
   the regeneration layer and the adult tree layer of the forest. Our
   results showed that the soil seed bank was influenced by both altitude

Abstract = {Natural regeneration after mining activities depends largely on the soil
   seed bank (SSB) and aboveground vegetation (AGV) richness and
   composition. We evaluated the species diversity pattern of the SSB and
   AGV on soil and technosol across second-growth Atlantic Forests (SGFs)
   after mining tailings deposition in Mariana, southeastern Brazil. Two
   second-growth Atlantic seasonal semideciduous forests of different stand
   ages were selected: a 3-year-old stand of SGF re-growing on tailings
   (SGF tailings) and a 30-year-old stand of native reference forest not
   affected by tailings (SGF nontailings). Overall, the results showed
   significant differences in forest attributes (species richness and
   composition) in the SSB and AGV between the two forest patches evaluated
   (SGF tailings and SGF nontailings). Moreover, both nonzoochoric and
   zoochoric dispersed species of AGV showed significant differences
   between second-growth forests, with higher variability of
   community-weighted mean in SGF tailings. The result shows smaller
   differences in species richness between forest types for both SBB
   (ranging 85 and 90 species) and AGV (similar to 55 species). Despite the
   time difference between the secondary forest and the absence of
   zoochoric species in the tailings seed bank, the AGV that are re-growing
   on mining tailings presented a high proportion of zoochoric species.
   This pattern of species richness and community composition variability
   observed in the technosol seed bank, and AGV that are re-growing after
   the deposition of mining tailings are important recovery indicators for
   plant communities affected.},

Abstract = {In this study, we examine the degradation of tropical forests caused by
   the forest fires of anthropogenic origin that have frequently and
   intensely affected a large portion of the State of Roraima (northern
   Brazilian Amazon), such as the one that occurred in 1998 and extended
   over 12,000 km(2). In a region located in the so-called ``Arc of
   Fire{''} in the State, data from all individuals with DBH >= 10 cm were
   collected in 50 sample plots (12.5 ha). These plots were collected
   across five fire-degradation levels (classes), from unaffected areas to
   areas affected by one, two or three fires over 10 years: 1998, 2003 and
   2007. The floristic and phytosociological quantitative parameters in the
   analysis were as follows: species richness (defined classically and by
   rarefaction), evenness, Shannon diversity index, mixture coefficient,
   importance value (dominance, density and frequency), basal area,
   diameter, total height and volume. In the full set of plots, 5593
   individuals were measured and identified in 177 species/morphospecies
   and 53 families. We performed both univariate (ANOVA and Tukey's test)
   and multivariate analyses (ordination methods), aiming to find patterns
   of degradation by fire. The results revealed that forests affected by
   one low-intensity fire (BF1L) showed slight evidence of alteration in
   comparison with forests that have not burned (UF), taking all indicators
   evaluated into account. In extremely degraded forest plots, the heavily
   impacted forests lose their primary-forest characteristics, showing
   significant floristic and structural changes and similarity to areas of
   young secondary succession. Some aspects of these disturbances were
   observed not only in twice or thrice-affected areas (BF2, BF3) but also
   in areas that suffered from one high-intensity fire (BF1H). Given the
   observed results, we ought to consider that an extensive
   ``secondarization{''} process caused by fire could plausibly reach more
   forest areas in this part of the Amazon in the near future. (C) 2012

   evaluated the fauna of termites of six fragments of stationary
   semideciduous forest and an area in early succession. In each one it was
   designed a transect (100 m x 2 m), divided into 20 plots (5 m x 2 m). In
   ten of these plots the collections were conducted under stones, in the
   nests, trunks and branches, over/under trunk barks and in five soil
   samples (340 cm(3)) of the A-horizon by plot with a sampling effort of
   60 minutes/plot. The composition, the observed and estimated species
   richness, the relation between area and observed richness, as well as
   the occurrence and dominance patterns of each species were analyzed.
   Eleven species from nine genera and two families (Kalotermitidae and
   Termitidae) were collected, rising the number of species registered in
   the state from 14 to 18. The subfamily, Apicotermitinae with the upper
   species richness (S=6), was found in five of the seven areas, while
   Nasutitermitinae, with the second highest number of species (S-obs=4),
   was collected in all areas. The richness varied from two to six species,
   and was not related to the area size. Five species were considered rare,
   but the others were intermediate. The areas were grouped in four groups
   with 60, 57, 50 and 40\% of similarity, with the species composition as
   the highest difference between them, suggesting that fragmentation of
   the local forest influenced more the composition than the richness of
   termites.},

Abstract = {The distribution of tree species in tropical forests is generally
   related to the occurrence of disturbances and shifts in the local
   environmental conditions such as light, temperature, and biotic factors.
   Thus, the distribution of pioneer tree species is expected to vary
   according to the gap characteristics and with human disturbances. We
   asked whether there was variation in the distribution of a pioneer
   species under different environmental conditions generated by natural
   disturbances, and between two forests with contrasting levels of human
   disturbance. To answer this question, we studied the distribution
   patterns and population persistence of the pioneer tree species Croton
   floribundus in the size and age gap range of a primary Brazilian forest.
   Additionally, we compared the plant density of two size-classes between
   a primary and an early successional human-disturbed forest. Croton
   floribundus was found to be widespread and equally distributed along the
   gap-size gradient in the primary forest. Overall density did not vary
   with gap size or age (F-ratio=0.062, P=0.941), and while juveniles were
   found to have a higher density in the early successional forest
   (P=0.021), tree density was found to be similar between forests
   (P=0.058). Our results indicate that the population structure of a
   pioneer tree species with long life span and a broad gap-size niche
   preference varied between natural and human-disturbed forests, but not
   with the level of natural disturbance. We believe this can be explained
   by the extreme environmental changes that occur after human disturbance.
   The ecological processes that affect the distribution of pioneer species
   in natural and human-modified forests may be similar, but our results
   suggest they act differently under the contrasting environmental
   conditions generated by natural and human disturbances.},

Abstract = {If logging and forest multiple-use are to be compatible with
   biodiversity conservation, then forest structure, composition and
   diversity must be expected to recover from the disturbance and
   eventually return to their former levels. Here we evaluate the long-term
   effects of selective logging and forest multiple-use on Southern
   Brazilian subtropical Araucaria mixed conifer-hardwood forest resilience
   at the landscape-scale. Long-term effects of different management
   regimes were compared between control undisturbed forests and forest
   stands subjected to early (55 years before this study) and recent (13
   years) selective logging followed by undisturbed postharvest periods,
   and forest fragments subjected to selective logging followed by
   unregulated multiple-use by private landowners. Forest structure (tree
   density, basal area and height, and regeneration density) in
   early-logged areas was indistinguishable from control areas.
   Fragmentation and chronic disturbance, however, degraded forest
   fragments and kept them at early successional stages, with higher tree
   density, reduced basal area and scarce or absent regeneration. Mixed
   forests showed compositional resilience in the angiosperm component but
   not in the conifer component. Chronic disturbance kept forest fragments
   floristically away from mature and undisturbed secondary forests.
   Species richness in control and recently-logged plots did not differ
   significantly and was higher than richness in early-logged plots.
   Species richness was much reduced in degraded forest fragments. Density
   of the conifer Araucaria angustifolia, characteristic of the mature
   forest, was reduced in the fragments and in logged stands. We discuss
   how native forest management practices can be implemented to contribute
   positively to the conservation of the Araucaria mixed forest
   biodiversity.},

Abstract = {Cocoa agroforests like the cabrucas of Brazil's Atlantic forest are
   among the agro-ecosystems with greatest potential for biodiversity
   conservation. Despite a global trend for their intensification, cocoa
   agroforests are also being abandoned for socioeconomic reasons
   especially on marginal sites, because they are incorporated in public or
   private protected areas, or are part of mandatory set-asides under
   Brazilian environmental legislation. However, little is known about
   phylogenetic structure, the processes of forest regeneration after
   abandonment and the conservation value of former cabruca sites. Here we
   compare the vegetation structure and composition of a former cabruca
   30-40 years after abandonment with a managed cabruca and mature forest
   in the Atlantic forest region of Espirito Santo, Brazil. The forest in
   the abandoned cabruca had recovered a substantial part of its original
   structure. Abandoned cabruca have a higher density (mean +/- CI95 \%:
   525.0 +/- 40.3 stems per ha), basal area (34.0 +/- 6.5 m(2) per ha) and
   species richness (148 +/- 11.5 species) than managed cabruca (96.0 +/-
   17.7; 24.15 +/- 3.9 and 114.5 +/- 16.0, respectively) but no significant
   differences to mature forest in density (581.0 +/- 42.2), basal area
   (29.9.0 +/- 3.3) and species richness (162.6 +/- 15.5 species). Thinning
   (understory removal) changes phylogenetic structure from evenness in
   mature forest to clustering in managed cabruca, but after 30-40 years
   abandoned cabruca had a random phylogenetic structure, probably due to a
   balance between biotic and abiotic filters at this age. We conclude that
   abandoned cocoa agroforests present highly favorable conditions for the
   regeneration of Atlantic forest and could contribute to the formation of
   an interconnected network of forest habitat in this biodiversity
   hotspot.},

Abstract = {Forest management for timber production has improved in tropical forests
   with the adoption of a poly cyclic silvicultural system (PSS) where
   harvesting is carried out using reduced-impact logging (RIL). In this
   study, the natural regeneration of forests harvested under RIL
   restrictions was assessed in three different sites of the Eastern Amazon
   two years after logging. A total of 7987 seedlings and saplings
   belonging to 197 species were sampled through 951 plots of 2 x 2 m in 11
   different natural and logging created environments. Light-demanding
   commercial species presented their highest density in logging
   environments such as logging gaps, skid trails, and borders of log
   decks. Shade-tolerant commercial species were more common in natural and
   logging gaps. Regarding the densities of harvested species in the three
   study sites, only 26.3\% were represented by >= 5 individuals and 28.1\%
   were completely absent in the surveys two years after logging. These
   results suggest a lack of natural regeneration of the current commercial
   tree species in the Eastern Amazon. Therefore, post-harvesting
   silvicultural treatments as enrichment planting and the tending of the
   natural regeneration in logging gaps should be applied to ensure the
   regeneration of these species. (C) 2016 Elsevier 13.V. All rights

Abstract = {The Brazilian Caatinga is among the most diverse dry forests in the
   world, yet half of its original coverage has been degraded. Natural
   regeneration is influenced by climatic and edaphic conditions, as well
   as the existing adult stratum. Despite its significance, this process
   remains poorly understood in the Caatinga. Thus, our study aimed to
   analyze how anthropogenic disturbance, vegetation cover, and soil
   properties affect the regenerating stratum under different levels of
   Caatinga vegetation cover. The research was conducted in the driest
   region of Brazil. The selected sites represent low (Area I) and high
   (Area II) normalized difference vegetation index. Six vegetable plots
   (50 x 20 m each) were delimited to study adult stratum, and four
   vegetable plots (10 x 10 m each) to regeneration stratum. Topsoil was
   sampled in all vegetable plots. Our results reveal interactions between
   soil characteristics and the adult and regenerating strata. Area II
   exhibited higher diversity and a greater number of exclusive species,
   while Area I was dominated by species more resistant to limiting
   conditions, such as Aspidosperma pyrifolium Mart. \& Zucc. The C and N
   content in the soil showed a positive and significant correlation with
   the diversity of the regenerating stratum. The data suggest that the
   area with less vegetation cover, richness, and diversity shows signs of

Abstract = {The taxonomic diversity (TD) of tropical flora and fauna tends to
   increase during secondary succession. This increase may be accompanied
   by changes in functional diversity (FD), although the relationship
   between TD and FD is not well understood. To explore this relationship,
   we examined the correlations between the TD and FD of ants and forest
   age in secondary forests at the alpha- and beta-diversity levels using
   single- and multi-trait-based approaches. Our objectives were to
   understand ant diversity patterns and to evaluate the role of secondary
   forests in the conservation of biodiversity and in the resilience of
   tropical forests. Ant assemblages were sampled across a chronosequence
   in the Lacandon region, Mexico. All species were characterized according
   to 12 functional ecomorphological traits relevant to their feeding
   behavior. We found that TD and FD were related to forest age at the
   alpha level, but not at the beta level. a- functional richness and
   divergence increased linearly with species richness and diversity,
   respectively. Also, the relationship between taxonomic and functional
   turnover was linear and positive. Our results indicated that functional
   traits were complementary across the chronosequence. The increase in FD
   was mainly driven by the addition of rare species with relevant traits.
   The older secondary forests did not recover all of the functions of old
   growth forest but did show a tendency to recovery. Because older
   successional stages support more TD and FD, we suggest developing
   agriculture and forestry management practices that facilitate rapid
   post-agricultural succession and thereby better preserve the
   functionality of tropical forests.},

   density were higher during the favourable plant growth season (spring
   and summer) than during the less favourable plant growth season (autumn
   and winter). Spore density displayed significant seasonal variation at
   all sites, whilst root colonization displayed significant seasonal
   variation in grassland, scrub and secondary forest, but not in mature
   forest. The data suggest that (1) different plant functional groups
   display different relationships with AM fungi, influencing their
   abundance differentially; (2) plant species from early successional
   phases are more susceptible to AM root colonization and maintain higher
   AM sporulation than late successional species; (3) fine root traits and
   nutrient status influence these AM fungal attributes; and (4) higher AM
   spore production and root colonization is associated with the season of
   higher light incidence and temperature, abundant water in soil and
   higher plant metabolic activity.},

Title = {Indicators of integrative recovery of vegetation, soil and microclimate
   in successional fields of a tropical dry forest},
Journal = {FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {479},
Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {Secondary succession involves dynamic feedback among vegetation,
   environmental conditions and biota. Nevertheless, the recovery of
   tropical forests after anthropic management is often evaluated based
   solely on vegetation cover, which is easier to measure and requires less
   equipment and expertise than the assessment of soil and microclimate,
   but does not always reflect synchronic and integrative recovery. Given
   the convenience of measuring vegetation properties, this study aimed to
   identify the vegetation traits that could best inform on the progress of
   integrative recovery through the exploration of correlations among
   changes in soil, vegetation and microclimate over the course of
   succession and by the selection of the most informative and suitable
   vegetation indicators. We measured vegetation, soil and microclimate
   properties along a successional gradient in the tropical dry forest
   region of the coast of Jalisco, Mexico. Biand multi-variate analyses
   revealed clear correlation between changes in soil and microclimate
   components. Bivariate and stepwise regressions indicated that basal
   area, litterfall, plant richness and litter mass were the vegetation
   properties that were the most related to soil and microclimate recovery.
   Basal area was the most closely related to soil and microclimate
   recovery, and it was also related to the recovery of soil P, a key soil
   property. However, litter mass, which was highly correlated with basal
   area, is a less time-consuming alternative measurement that may be more
   manageable for assessing many sites. Litter mass is also a key variable
   connecting aboveground and belowground recovery processes, making it a
   particularly useful variable for evaluating integrative recovery. Since
   all indicators can be affected by natural or human disturbance, the
   choice of indicators to be used in each evaluation should be cautious
   and, whenever possible, consider the history of the plot. We discuss and
   suggest the complementary use of several indicators when disturbance has
   occurred during secondary succession.},

Title = {Thinning temporarily stimulates tree regeneration in a restored tropical
   forest},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {171},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {When an ecosystem undergoing restoration does not follow the desired
   trajectory, management interventions may be warranted. Where the initial
   steps towards restoration include tree planting at high densities,
   reduction of stand basal area (BA) by overstory thinning is a potential
   adaptive management tool to stimulate natural regeneration, although it
   can also damage young plants. We ask how tree regeneration in a restored
   tropical forest responds to different intensities of thinning. We
   applied two intensities of thinning to a 22-yr-old restored forest in
   southeastern Brazil and then sampled seedlings and saplings before and
   over an eight year period after thinning; unthinned plots were retained
   as controls. Thinning impacts on the woody understory were negligible,
   far below annual mortality in control plots. Positive responses to
   thinning were stronger in the treatment with low remaining basal area
   (ca. 30\% below the reference forests), with increases in seedling
   density, numbers of recruits, and seedling-to-sapling and
   sapling-to-tree transitions. Understory dynamics were clearly
   intensified by gap opening, with a pulse of natural regeneration in the
   first years after thinning. These changes, however, were not
   simultaneous and did not usually persist over time. Rarefied richness of
   the understory increased over time after all treatments and changes in
   species composition of saplings were enhanced by thinning. Our study
   gives support to selective timber harvests from restored tropical
   forests insofar as thinning did not threaten the understory and
   stimulated natural regeneration. Frequency and intensity of thinning
   operations, however, should be locally adjusted based on monitoring
   data.},

Abstract = {Lianas are woody vines that rely on external support for height growth.
   Although variations among species of lianas in traits ranging from
   climbing mechanism to stem anatomy have been described, little attention
   has been paid to interspecific differences in life history traits. The
   objective of this study was to assess the diversity in life history
   strategies among lianas in an old-growth forest of the eastern Brazilian
   Amazon. Population size class structure, microsite light environment
   affinity, forest successional phase affinity, and regeneration mode were
   assessed and growth and mortality rates were measured over 3 years for
   six species of lianas: Acacia multipinnata, Bauhinia cupreonitans,
   Bauhinia guianensis, Croton ascendens, Memora schomburgkii, and Serjania
   caracasana.
   Each of the study species had a free-standing seedling phase prior to
   the initiation of climbing, but the density of freestanding saplings (
   greater than or equal to50 cm tall) ranged widely among species from 408
   stems ha(-1) for B. guianensis to 2 stems ha(-1) for A. multipinnata.
   Species also differed in their propensity for vegetative reiteration of
   rooted stems; the mean number of climbing ramets per genet ranged from
   1.1 for B. guianensis to 7.4 for S. caracasana. Four of the study
   species (M. schomburgkii, S. caracasana, and both species of Bauhinia)
   had the majority of climbing ramets in small diameter classes. However,
   for two of these species (M. schomburgkii and S. caracasana) the size
   class distributions of the largest stems per genet were flat and
   unimodal, respectively. A. multipinnata and C. ascends had flat size
   class distributions of both ramets and largest stems per genet.
   Among the six species there were three apparent patterns of changing
   association with light environment and forest successional phase over
   size classes. Two species (M. schomburgkii and B. guianensis) are late
   successional species. These species were found in all forest phases at
   relatively low median levels of illumination as seedlings and
   free-standing saplings, more frequently associated with gaps as small
   diameter climbing stems, and in late building and mature phase forest as
   larger (greater than or equal to1.5 cm diameter) climbing stems. Three
   species (B. cupreonitans, S. caracasana, and A. multipinnata) are early
   successional species. These species were distinguished from late
   successional species by occurring in better illuminated and more
   gap-associated microsites as free-standing saplings and by remaining
   strongly associated with early building phase forest as large diameter
   stems. Only C. ascendens, is like a pioneer species in being found
   exclusively in high light microsites in its freestanding stages and
   associated with gaps or early building phase forest as climbing stems.
   Median stem diameter growth rates were correlated with successional
   class ranging from the lowest in late successional species to the
   highest in the pioneer species. Annual ramet mortality rates differed
   among species with the lowest rates for the late successional species
   (1.3 and 4.3\% for M. schomburgkii and B. guianensis, respectively).
   Annual genet mortality rates were lower than ramet mortality rates and
   ranged from 0.2\% for M. schomburgkii to 5.5\% for C. ascendens. The
   results suggest that, while lianas exhibit a diversity of life history
   strategies, some patterns in liana life history traits, for example a
   positive correlation between stem diameter growth rate and mortality
   rate, may parallel patterns found for trees. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All

Journal = {REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {24},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The vegetative growth of forest canopies changes their spectral
   response, which can be detected by multispectral sensors and enhanced by
   utilizing the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). The
   structural variability of canopies in heterogeneous forests can also be
   related to successional stages. Thereby, a spatiotemporal methodology is
   presented to associate the 3D photogrammetric information, derived from
   aerial images, with the NDVI time series extracted from the Landsat
   imagery, using spatial units connected to ecological succession. The
   technique is based on time series clustering within superpixels
   (extracted from the local variance of tree heights) and on trend
   analysis of the canopy using the breaks for additive season and trend
   (BFAST) algorithm. The study was conducted in a tropical native forest
   remnant (Inland Atlantic Forest) in the western region of Sao Paulo
   State, Brazil. We investigated the relationship between the variability
   of the forest vertical structure and the NDVI temporal trajectory
   associated with vegetation vigor in the period from 1984 to 2010. The
   experiments produced a regularized time series of overlaid superpixels.
   The cluster statistical analysis was successful in separating the NDVI
   trajectory into ten classes associated to successional stages, in which
   the evolution of the vegetation vigor could be observed and compared
   within degraded, transitional, and preserved areas. Such areas
   overlapping with the ten trajectory classes allowed us to quantify that
   59.9\% of the clusters were related to preserved areas, 30.1\% to
   transitional areas, and 10.0\% to degraded areas. Additionally, the
   BFAST algorithm allowed the identification of trend measures and the
   occurrence of disturbance events within these trajectory classes based
   on the vegetation response. Therefore, the classification of NDVI
   trajectory clusters helps to understand how the areas in a heterogeneous
   forest with different succession stages develop spectrally. Furthermore,
   monitoring secondary forests is essential for the conservation of
   biodiversity, ecosystem functioning, and carbon stock, among other
   values.},

Abstract = {A high level of variation of biodiversity recovery within a landscape
   during forest restoration presents obstacles to ensure large-scale,
   cost-effective and long-lasting ecological restoration. There is an
   urgent need to predict landscape variation in forest restoration success
   at a global scale. We conducted a meta-analysis comprising 135 study
   landscapes to predict and map landscape variation in forest restoration
   success in tropical and temperate forest biomes. Our analysis was based
   on the amount of forest cover within a landscape - a key driver of
   forest restoration success. We contrasted 17 generalized linear models
   measuring forest cover at different landscape sizes (with buffers
   varying from 5 to 200 km radii). We identified the most plausible model
   to predict and map landscape variation in forest restoration success. We
   then weighted landscape variation by the amount of potentially
   restorable areas (agriculture and pasture land areas) within the same
   landscape. Finally, we estimated restoration costs of implementing Bonn
   Challenge commitments in three specific temperate and tropical forest
   biome types in the United States, Brazil and Uganda. Landscape variation
   decreased exponentially as the amount of forest cover increased in the
   landscape, with stronger effects within a 5 km radius. Thirty-eight per
   cent of forest biomes have landscapes with more than 27\% of forest
   cover and showed levels of landscape variation below 10\%. Landscapes
   with less than 6\% of forest cover showed levels of variation in forest
   restoration success above 50\%. At the biome level, Tropical and
   Subtropical Moist Broadleaf Forests had the lowest (12.6\%), whereas
   Tropical and Subtropical Dry Broadleaf Forests had the highest (22.9\%)
   average of weighted landscape variation in forest restoration success.
   Our approach can lead to a reduction in implementation costs for each
   Bonn Challenge commitment between US\$ 973 Mi and 9.9 Bi. Policy
   implications. Our approach identifies landscape characteristics that
   increase the likelihood of biodiversity recovery during forest
   restoration - and potentially the chances of natural regeneration and
   long-term ecological sustainability and functionality. Identifying areas
   with low levels of landscape variation can help to reduce the risks and
   financial costs associated with implementing ambitious restoration
   commitments.},

Abstract = {Little is known about the relationship involving arbuscular mycorrhizal
   (AM) fungi and functional groups of plants that characterize different
   phases of tropical succession. We appraised the AM infection intensity
   of root cortex and spore density in the soil in sites over tropical
   successional gradients (grassland. secondary forest and mature forest)
   for several years in Araucaria. Atlantic and Pantanal ecosystems in
   Brazil. The intensity of AM infection decreased with advancing
   successional stages in all ecosystems and it was around 60-80\% in early
   stages of succession, 37-56\% in secondary forests and 19-29\% in mature
   forests. Similarly, the AM spore number also decreased with advancing
   succession and was the highest in early stages (73-123 g(-1)).
   intermediate in secondary forests (32-54 g(-1)) and lowest in the mature
   forests (10-23 g(-1)). To verify whether such reductions influenced the
   potential of AM inoculum in soil, seedlings of Heliocarpus popayanensis
   (Malvaceae) were grown as test plants in soils obtained from five
   grasslands. five young secondary forests, and live mature forests in the
   Atlantic ecosystem. The soil inocula from the grasslands and secondary
   forests were 7.6 and 5.7 times more effective in stimulating seedling
   growth than inocula from the mature forests, respectively. Our results
   show that plant species in grasslands and young secondary forests
   stimulate the multiplication of AM fungi. leading to a higher potential
   of the AM inoculum. In later-successional stages, plant investment in AM
   fungi decreases and the potential of the AM inoculum is also reduced.},

Month = {JUN 1},
Abstract = {Deforestation of tropical forests has contributed to the formation of
   fragmented landscapes, surrounded mainly by a matrix of secondary
   forests, pastures and agriculture. In this study we evaluated the
   fragment-area effects on the density, diversity and composition of the
   soil seed bank. Fragments of primary forest of different sizes (1,10 and
   100 ha) and continuous primary forests were sampled in a region of terra
   firme forest in Central Amazonia. We collected 180 soil samples (45
   samples per treatment), and monitored seedling emergence from the soil
   seed bank in a greenhouse for seven months. Density of emerged
   seedlings, floristic composition, richness and diversity of species were
   compared among treatments with Kruskal-Wallis non-parametric test,
   Mann-Whitney test, Fisher's Alpha diversity index and Non-metric
   multidimensional scaling (NMDS). Seedling density was inversely
   proportional to the size of the fragment, being higher in fragments of 1
   ha, 10 ha, and lower in the primary forest and fragments of 100 ha.
   Diversity was higher in the fragments when compared to the primary
   forests. Melastomataceae was the most abundant family in all treatments.
   Species composition changed along the disturbance gradient, and is
   dominated, in the smaller fragments by species that are indicators of
   degraded environments. Results suggested that the area of the forest
   fragments affects the size and composition of the soil seed bank, and
   can significantly influence the potential resilience and regeneration of
   these sites in the event of natural or anthropic disturbance. (C) 2017

Title = {Nutrient limitation in tropical secondary forests following different
   management practices},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {27},
Number = {3},
Pages = {734-755},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Secondary forests now make up more than one-half of all tropical
   forests, and constraints on their biomass accumulation will influence
   the strength of the terrestrial carbon (C) sink in the coming decades.
   However the variance in secondary tropical forest biomass for a given
   stand age and climate is high and our understanding of why is limited.
   We constructed a model of terrestrial C, nitrogen (N), and phosphorus
   (P) cycling to examine the influence of disturbance and management
   practices on nutrient limitation and biomass recovery in secondary
   tropical forests. The model predicted that N limited the rate of forest
   recovery in the first few decades following harvest, but that this
   limitation switched to P approximately 30-40 yr after abandonment,
   consistent with field data on N and P cycling from secondary tropical
   forest chronosequences. Simulated biomass recovery agreed well with
   field data of biomass accumulation following harvest (R-2 = 0.80). Model
   results showed that if all biomass remained on site following a severe
   disturbance such as blowdown, regrowth approached pre-disturbance
   biomass in 80-90 yr, and recovery was faster following smaller
   disturbances such as selective logging. Field data from regrowth on
   abandoned pastures were consistent with simulated losses of nutrients in
   soil organic matter, particularly P. Following any forest disturbance
   that involved the removal of nutrients (i.e., except blowdown), forest
   regrowth produced reduced biomass relative to the initial state as a
   result of nutrient loss through harvest, leaching and/or sequestration
   by secondary minerals. Differences in nutrient availability accounted
   for 49-94\% of the variance in secondary forest biomass C at a given
   stand age. Management lessons from this study are the importance of
   strategies that help retain nutrients on site, recognizing the role of
   coarse woody debris in immobilization and subsequent release of
   nutrients, and the potential for nutrient additions to enhance biomass
   growth and recovery in secondary tropical forests.},

Title = {A spatially explicit index for mapping Forest Restoration Vocation (FRV)
   at the landscape scale: Application in the Rio Doce basin, Brazil},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {744},
Month = {NOV 20},
Abstract = {Effectively implementing landscape-scale forest restoration on the
   ground is particularly challenging. Available decision-support tools
   particularly lack the ability to comprehensively incorporate
   biophysical, social and institutional dimensions in a spatially explicit
   manner from the pixel to the whole landscape. In order to contribute to
   fulfilling this gap, this paper has two major objectives. The first is
   to present a spatially explicit decision-support tool for mapping Forest
   Restoration Vocation (FRV) that includes socio-economic and
   institutional aspects in forest landscape restoration. The second is to
   discuss the ways in which the FRV has been applied in the Brazilian
   decision-making context. The FRV was used to prioritize areas for three
   different restoration modalities: assisted natural regeneration (passive
   restoration), forest plantation with native trees to conserve
   biodiversity and forest plantation for agroforestry systems (active
   restoration). The FRV is already being adopted as a planning tool to
   invest R\$ 1.2 billion (approx. US\$ 300 million) to restore 40,000 ha
   in the Rio Doce, Brazil-an area corresponding to 0.05\% of the area of
   watershed. Due to the high level of degradation of the basin, there is a
   need to restore 1.6 Mha via forest plantations in riparian Areas of
   Permanent Preservation (APPs) while 30\% of APPs can be effectively
   restored using natural regeneration. The FRV can be effective for
   gauging progress and monitoring forest restoration implementation
   metrics across the landscape and through time. There are however still
   problems in effectively assessing if the investment in forest
   restoration will generate impact in the long term and deliver the
   ecosystem services society depends on. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {Naturally regenerating forests or secondary forests (SFs) are a
   promising strategy for restoring large expanses of tropical forests at
   low cost and with high environmental benefits. This expectation is
   supported by the high resilience of tropical forests after natural
   disturbances, yet this resilience can be severely reduced by human
   impacts. Assessing the characteristics of SFs and their ecological
   integrity (EI) is essential to evaluating their role for conservation,
   restoration, and provisioning of ecosystem services. In this study, we
   aim to propose a concept and indicators that allow the assessment and
   classification of the EI of SFs. To this end, we review the literature
   to assess how EI has been addressed in different ecosystems and which
   indicators of EI are most commonly used for tropical forests. Building
   upon this knowledge we propose a modification of the concept of EI to
   embrace SFs and suggest indicators of EI that can be applied to
   different successional stages or stand ages. Additionally, we relate
   these indicators to ecosystem service provision in order to support the
   practical application of the theory. EI is generally defined as the
   ability of ecosystems to support and maintain composition, structure and
   function similar to the reference conditions of an undisturbed
   ecosystem. This definition does not consider the temporal dynamics of
   recovering ecosystems, such as SFs. Therefore, we suggest incorporation
   of an optimal successional trajectory as a reference in addition to the
   old-growth forest reference. The optimal successional trajectory
   represents the maximum EI that can be attained at each successional
   stage in a given region and enables the evaluation of EI at any given
   age class. We further suggest a list of indicators, the main ones being:
   compositional indicators (species diversity/richness and indicator
   species); structural indicators (basal area, heterogeneity of basal area
   and canopy cover); function indicators (tree growth and mortality); and
   landscape proxies (landscape heterogeneity, landscape connectivity).
   Finally, we discuss how this approach can assist in defining the value
   of SF patches to provide ecosystem services, restore forests and
   contribute to ecosystem conservation.},

Abstract = {Currently, a large-scale restoration project aims to restore around 15
   million hectares of Atlantic Forest in Brazil. This will increase forest
   cover and connectivity among remnant sites as well as restore
   environmental services. Currently, studies on recovery of fauna in
   restored areas of the Atlantic Forest are practically nonexistent. To
   address this knowledge vacuum, our study compares diversity patterns of
   fruit-feeding butterflies in three forest areas with different
   restoration ages (11, 22, and 54 years), and uses a native forest area
   as reference. Results showed butterfly communities in maturing restored
   areas becoming more similar to the ones found in the native forest, with
   an increase in the proportional abundance of forest species, and a
   decrease of edge and grassland species. Moreover, we found a higher
   diversity among sites at the intermediate restoration age, with a
   community composed of both grassland and forest species. Butterfly
   species composition differed significantly among sites, showing
   interesting patterns of potential species replacement over time. Our
   results indicate that, although restored sites were located in a
   fragmented landscape, they provide suitable habitats for recolonization
   by fruit-feeding butterfly assemblages. Hence, restored areas can be
   considered important habitat for forest animal species, increasing local
   biodiversity and, possibly, restoring some of the ecosystem services
   provided by them.},

Abstract = {This work was developed with the objective of comparing the diameter
   structure and natural regeneration indicators of Brazil nut groves and
   correlates them to the forest successional stage, seed collection

   were compared by measures of central tendency, variability, form and
   adherence by Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test. Natural regeneration was
   correlated with environmental variables, seed collection intensity and
   fauna activity by Spearman correlation coefficient and Kruskal-Wallis.
   The Brazil nut groves presented different diametric structures, which
   can be attributed to differences in young individuals in the smaller
   diametric classes. The higher density of juveniles in canopy gaps and
   the lack of a significant correlation between seed collection intensity
   and natural regeneration indicate that canopy openings from logging
   could have been the major impact factor in the natural regeneration

Abstract = {Defining the reference system for restoration projects in regions
   characterized by complex vegetation mosaics is challenging. Here we use
   the Cerrado region of Brazil as an example of the importance of clearly
   defining multiple natural and anthropogenically altered states in
   grassland-savanna-forest mosaics. We define three main, natural
   vegetation types-grassland, savanna, and scleromorphic (cerradao)
   forest-to (1) distinguish between original and degraded states and (2)
   set appropriate targets for and guide restoration. We contend that the
   differences in Cerrado vegetation composition originally were driven by
   soil conditions and secondarily by fire frequency and precipitation
   patterns that differ from the core to the edge of the Cerrado region.
   Grasslands are found on the shallowest, least fertile soils and/or in
   waterlogged soils; scleromorphic forests are generally located on
   deeper, more fertile soils; and savannas occupy an intermediate
   position. In recent decades, this biophysical template has been overlain
   by a range of human land-use intensities that strongly affect
   resilience, resulting in alternative anthropogenic states. For example,
   areas that were originally scleromorphic forest are likely to regenerate
   naturally following low- or medium-intensity land use due to extensive
   resprouting of woody plants, whereas grassland restoration requires
   reintroduction of grass and forb species that do not tolerate soil
   disturbance and exotic grass competition. Planting trees into historic
   grasslands results in inappropriate restoration targets and often
   restoration failure. Correctly identifying original vegetation types is
   critical to most effectively allocate scarce restoration funding.},

Abstract = {Spanish cedar (Cedrela odorata L.) and Yellow poui (Tabebuia
   serratifolia Nichols.) are economically valuable tropical tree species
   that have been threatened by predatory logging and by forest
   fragmentation. Their seeds are wind-dispersed and both the species
   colonize and grow-up in pastures. This study compared the genetic
   diversity in a pasture-established population to a forest population.
   Thirty yellow poui trees were genotyped with five isozyme loci and fifty
   four spanish cedar trees were genotyped with four microsatellite loci.
   Genetic diversity was high in both the populations. In yellow poui,
   genetic diversity was higher in the pasture population. It was observed
   loss of alleles in cedar pasture population (A = 11,75 alleles/locus) in
   relation to the forest population (A = 14,50). Moreover, 31\% of the
   cedar alleles were private to the forest population. Genetic divergence
   was null in yellow poui populations, but significant in the cedar ones
   (2,2\%). Pasture populations don't show evidence of severe genetic
   bottleneck for both the species. Colonization of anthropogenic areas by
   these species was efficient, but it requires continuous gene flow,
   through successive generations, in order to restore (for spanish cedar)
   and maintain (for yellow poui) the levels of genetic diversity observed
   in the forest population.},

Abstract = {Uncertainties remain in the use of remote sensing technologies to
   provide validated model-derived estimates of the biomass of the
   secondary succession (SS) forests in the Amazon Basin. The objectives of
   this study were to develop a modeling framework for creating a valid
   spectrum-biomass model to estimate the SS biomass, to assess the utility
   of the framework and the accuracy and validity of the model, and to
   identify the model's determinants. Data sources for this study include
   1992-1993 vegetation inventory data and 1991 Landsat Thematic Mapper
   (TM) data on the Altamira region of Para, Brazil, and 1994-1995
   vegetation inventory data and 1994 Landsat TM data on the nearby
   Bragantina region. The allometric approach was used to estimate the
   biomass of the sampled sites based on the vegetation inventory data. A
   framework for the spectrum-biomass regression model was developed based
   on the estimated biomass of the sampled sites and the Landsat data. The
   framework includes (1) the pooling of data from Bragantina and the use
   of ANCOVA to justify this approach; (2) image calibration; (3) biomass
   data age-adjustment, (4) selection of independent variables, (5)
   regression model development, and (6) model assessment and validation.
   The cubic regression model with TM Band5-related predictors was found to
   best fit the data as evidenced by an adjusted R-squared value of 0.865,
   mean square error (MSE) of the model, and the analysis of residuals.
   Residual analysis showed that the model might yield a better estimation
   on a lower biomass values than on higher biomass values. In addition,
   further analyses identified several determinants that can impact the
   accuracy of the spectrum-biomass model. ANCOVA confirmed that the
   relationship between the biomass and the spectrum is independent of the
   Altamira and Bragantina regions, and that it was appropriate to pool
   sampled data from both regions in the proposed model. The model
   development methodology and the model produced from this research will
   be of value to researchers using the spectrum-biomass modeling
   approaches to estimate the biomass and study the SS rates in moist
   tropical forests. Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of International

Abstract = {QuestionsDo the assemblages of pollination modes in restored (tree
   plantings) and secondary (naturally regenerated) forests change in
   comparison to primary forests, and how do these assemblages relate to
   species turnover at regional scale?
   LocationSoutheast region of Brazil.
   MethodsWe classified tree species found in a total of 40 forest sites
   (18 primary, 11 restored, 11 secondary) according to pollination mode,
   based on the literature. We calculated and compared functional
   dissimilarity distances, amounts of species and accumulated abundance of
   pollination modes, and functional indices of richness and evenness
   between forest types.
   ResultsFunctional dissimilarity distances were much smaller than species
   dissimilarity distances within forest types (mean <20\%, >80\%,
   respectively), indicating a small variation in pollination modes between
   sites. Functional indices of richness and evenness did not differ
   between forest types. However, significant changes were found in the
   species and abundance proportions of several pollination modes. Primary
   forests were characterized by the predominance of generalized
   insect-pollinated species, followed by secondary proportions of bee,
   wind and moth pollination; other pollination modes were
   underrepresented. In restored forests, reductions were found in
   generalized insect, moth, wind, fly, pollen-consuming insect and
   very-small insect pollination, whereas the species pollinated by bees
   and bats more than doubled. Smaller changes were found among secondary
   forests, including reductions in moth, fly and fig-wasp pollination,
   whereas there were incremental changes in bee, beetle, big animal and
   small insect pollination.
   ConclusionsOur results indicate a rather stable assemblage of
   pollination modes and also high ecological redundancy among trees
   regardless of the species replacement at the regional scale. Major
   changes among restored forests are probably in response to larger
   disturbance effects and/or restoration practices conducted in these
   sites. In contrast, smaller changes among secondary forests could be in
   response to smaller disturbance effects and natural selection processes,
   and also seem to suggest that highly resilient degraded areas are more
   likely to recuperate their functional diversity through natural
   regeneration alone. In both cases, however, efforts to recover such
   patterns should be encouraged to avoid possible negative effects in
   plant-pollinator interactions.},

Abstract = {This paper presents a simulation of the regulation of Araucaria
   angustifolia (Bertol.) Kuntze timber stocks using Liocourt's law.
   Although this species is currently protected by law, recent government
   initiatives are being considered to propose sustainable forest
   management practices by selecting small rural properties in Southern
   Brazil. Here, we simulate the applicability of Liocourt's law in a
   typical rural property, the size of which is approximately 85 ha. Forest
   inventory measurements were conducted by estimating the diameter at the
   breast height (d), total height (h), and annual diameter increments of
   308 trees that fit the criteria of d >= 10 cm, distributed on 35
   permanent plots of 400 m(2) each. As a result, a reverse J-shaped d
   distribution was found. On average, 303 trees can be found per hectare
   (ha). Local allometric equations showed their basal area (G) to be 21.9
   m(2).ha(-1), and their commercial volume (V) to be 172 m(3).ha(-1),
   whereas Liocourt's quotient (q) was 1.31. Based on these attributes,
   nine different forest management scenarios were proposed by simulating a
   remaining basal area (Grem) of 10.0, 14.0, and 18.0 m(2).ha(-1), and
   Liocourt's quotient was changed to 1.1, 1.3, and 1.5. All scenarios
   consider a d of 62.5 cm. In the less intensive scenario (i.e., q value =
   1.5 and larger basal area of 18.0 m(2)ha(-1)) there is greater
   optimization of space, and higher economic return is ensured to rural
   producers due to the definition of shorter cutting cycles. This also
   allows a faster growth rate in both d and h for smaller trees, due to
   the higher incidence of light onto the lower canopy layer, increasing
   the natural regeneration implementation of other native species. Forest
   management should thus be considered a goal in addition to consumer
   market characteristics for defining the ideal timber stock scenario.},

Title = {Habitat structure and food resources for wildlife across successional
   stages in a tropical forest},
Journal = {FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {283},
Pages = {119-127},
Month = {NOV 1},
Abstract = {Tropical forests are experiencing an increase in the proportion of
   secondary forests as a result of the balance between the widespread
   harvesting of old-growth forests and the regeneration in abandoned
   areas. The impacts of such a process on biodiversity are poorly known
   and intensely debated. Recent reviews and multi-taxa studies indicate
   that species replacement in wildlife assemblages is a consistent
   pattern, sometimes stronger than changes in diversity, with a
   replacement from habitat generalists to old-growth specialists being
   commonly observed during tropical forest regeneration. However, the
   ecological drivers of such compositional changes are rarely
   investigated, despite its importance in assessing the conservation value
   of secondary forests, and to support and guide management techniques for
   restoration. By sampling 28 sites in a continuous Atlantic forest area
   in Southeastern Brazil, we assessed how important aspects of habitat
   structure and food resources for wildlife change across successional
   stages, and point out hypotheses on the implications of these changes
   for wildlife recovery. Old-growth areas presented a more complex
   structure at ground level (deeper leaf litter, and higher woody debris
   volume) and higher fruit availability from an understorey palm, whereas
   vegetation connectivity, ground-dwelling arthropod biomass, and total
   fruit availability were higher in earlier successional stages. From
   these results we hypothetize that generalist species adapted to fast
   population growth in resource-rich environments should proliferate and
   dominate earlier successional stages, while species with higher
   competitive ability in resource-limited environments, or those that
   depend on resources such as palm fruits, on higher complexity at the
   ground level, or on open space for flying, should dominate older-growth
   forests. Since the identification of the drivers of wildlife recovery is
   crucial for restoration strategies, it is important that future work
   test and further develop the proposed hypotheses. We also found
   structural and functional differences between old-growth forests and
   secondary forests with more than 80 years of regeneration, suggesting
   that restoration strategies may be crucial to recover structural and
   functional aspects expected to be important for wildlife in much altered
   ecosystems, such as the Brazilian Atlantic forest. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Journal = {ACTA AMAZONICA},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {55},
Abstract = {Sustainable forest management is an important strategy for the
   conservation of tropical secondary forests. However, knowledge about
   their potential for timber production is scarce, especially in the
   Central Amazon. We performed a silvicultural diagnosis in Central Amazon
   secondary forests to understand their potential for forest management.
   The diagnosis was carried out in two secondary forest patches at
   advanced successional stages located 38 km north and 75 km northeast of
   Manaus. We quantified the commercial tree species, classified their stem
   quality and growth conditions (crown exposure and liana infestation),
   and related tree size (diameter at breast height-DBH) to growth
   conditions. We identified 46 commercial tree species. Goupia glabra, a
   very important timber species, exhibited the highest density of
   individuals (more than 95 individuals ha-1). Good and reasonable quality
   stems accounted for 87\% of the commercial trees, with 45 and 42\%
   classified as of good and reasonable quality, respectively. The species
   composition and stem quality of the examined secondary forests support
   timber production through sustainable management. Commercial trees
   predominantly had crowns with low light exposure (63\% with a Dawkins
   index lower than 4) and were liana infested (62\% with lianas on some
   part of the tree), requiring silvicultural treatments to improve growth
   conditions. The number of trees under suppressed growth conditions (low
   light and liana-infested) varied according to species and tree size,
   requiring specific recommendations for silvicultural treatments. These
   results demonstrate the potential of secondary forests for timber
   production and provide valuable insights for management strategies
   aiming at promoting sustainable management to prevent secondary forest
   deforestation.},

Volume = {56},
Abstract = {The objective of this work was to evaluate the effect of brushwood,
   black plastic mulch, herbicide, and artificial perch on the natural
   regeneration of native species in Urochloa grassland. The experiment was
   conducted between February 2014 and February 2016 in the Dense
   Ombrophilous Forest, in the municipality of Morretes, in the state of
   Parana, Brazil. The treatments were: herbicide, herbicide + perch, black
   plastic mulch, black plastic mulch + perch, brushwood + herbicide.
   brushwood + herbicide + perch, and a control treatment. The evaluations
   were carried out at 4, 8, 12, 18, and 24 months after the installation
   of the experiment, by counting and identifying regenerating woody
   species and estimating visually the percentage of herbaceous coverage.
   Initially, brushwood and black plastic mulch reduced the Urochloa
   grasses; however, this effect was lost over time due to the rapid growth
   of the grasses from the edges to the center of the plots. The use of
   perches in the treatments does not allow a significant increase of other
   species because of the continued inhibiting conditions for the
   establishment of seedlings. The herbicide is effective in removing the
   grasses; however, the recruitment of woody species is only satisfactory
   when perches are used to attract the dispersing fauna. For a successful
   ecological restoration of pastures, there is a need for the local
   elimination of Urochloa grasses.},

Abstract = {Natural regeneration of tree species at different toposequences was
   assessed in an area of 40 ha in Vicosa-MG.(20 degrees 45'S and 42
   degrees 55' W), preserved since 1965, with minimum altitude of 730 m and
   maximum of 870 m. The soil was classified as Red-yellow alico Latisol
   and the vegetation was characterized as semideciduous forest. The 1.0
   samplings consisted of 40 sub-units (samples with 5 x 5 m). These
   sub-units were inserted in the middle samples (10 x 25 m). previously
   evaluated the phyto-sociology of the tree community distributed in the
   toposequence's different: plan (5.07 ha - 5 sub-units), lean (13.2 ha -
   15 sub-units), ravine (17.28 ha - 17 sub-units) and top (2.43 ha - 3
   sub-units). Was developed with heights divided in three categories (1 -
   individuals with minimum height 1 <= 2 m; 2 - individuals with minimum
   heights 2 <= 3 m; 3 - individuals with heigts > 3 m). The inclusion
   level was of CAP < 15,0 cm. 957 individuals were observed, belonging to
   30 families, 72 genery and 91 species. The regeneration presented 31
   species in the three size classes. This result allows saying that
   possibly, these species, will be present in the future forest. The
   species with better acting in the total natural regeneration for height
   class were: Psychotria sessilis, Siparuna arianeae, Anadenathera
   macrocarpa, Nectandra saligna, Piptadenia gonoacantha, Nectandra rigida,
   Bauhinia forficata, Psycotria carthagenensis, Miconia pusilliflora and
   Mollinedia floribunda. These species had presented efficient in what
   concerns the succession process in the area. Psycotria sessilis and
   Siparuna arianeae, with 254 and 76 individuals respectively, get the
   attention for their aggressive presence in the regeneration process, for
   they be typical of the sub-forest. For the analysis of Correspondence
   carried through in the toposequence, it was since the ravine and plan
   had had greater floristic similarity of what excessively.},

Abstract = {Secondary forests may become increasingly important as temporary
   reservoirs of genetic diversity, stocks of carbon and nutrients, and
   moderators of hydrologic cycles in the Amazon Basin as agricultural
   lands are abandoned and often later cleared again for agriculture. We
   studied a municipality in northeastern Par, Brazil, that has been
   settled for over a century and where numerous cycles of slash and burn
   agriculture have occurred. The forests were grouped into young (3-6
   years), intermediate (10-20 years), advanced (40-70 years), and mature
   successional stages using 1999 Landsat 7 ETM imagery. Supervised
   classification of the imagery showed that these forest classes occupied
   22\%, 13\%, 9\%, and 6\% of the area, respectively. Although this area
   underwent widespread deforestation many decades ago, forest of some type
   covers about 50\% of the area. Row crops, tree crops, and pastures cover
   8\%, 20\%, and 22\%, respectively. The best separation among land covers
   appeared in a plot of NDVI versus band 5 reflectance. The same groupings
   of successional forests were derived independently from indices of
   similarity among tree species composition. Measured distributions of
   tree height and diameter also covaried with these successional classes,
   with the young forests having nearly uniform distributions, whereas
   multiple height and diameter classes were present in the advanced
   successional forests. Biomass accumulated more slowly in this secondary
   forest chronosequence than has been reported for other areas, which
   explains why the 70-year-old forests here were still distinguishable
   from mature forests using spectral properties. Rates of forest regrowth
   may vary across regions due to differences in edaphic, climatic, and
   historical land-use factors, thus rendering most relationships among
   spectral properties and forest age site-specific. Successional status,
   as characterized by species composition, biomass, and distributions of
   heights and diameters, may be superior to stand age as a means of
   stratifying these forests for characterization of spectral properties.

Abstract = {The objective of this study was to evaluate the woody shrub layer of a
   restored forest through planting after 40 years of its implementation,
   in Vicosa, MG. It was allocated in the total area of one hectare, 16
   contiguous plots of 25 x 25 m to assess the woody shrub layer, recording
   all individuals with PBH >= 15 cm. It was recorded 1,432 individuals,
   112 species and 36 families, of which 95 were native and 16 were exotic
   species, with higher Importance Value for Guarea guidonia and Fabaceae
   family, high diversity (H'= 3.51) and low ecological dominance (J' =
   0.743), higher percentage of early secondary successional class at the
   species level (34.82\%), and late secondary at the level of individuals
   (34.29\%), and predominance of syndrome of seed dispersal by animals.
   The basal area was 47.8 m(2)/ha and the average height of 10.6 m,
   ranging from 2.2 m to 27.2 m. The 0-20 cm layer soil had a an average
   base saturation (V = 43.40\%) and 20-40 cm layer of low base saturation
   (V = 34.70\%), with soil density (1.08 and 1.07 kg / m(3)) within the
   ideal range for clay soils. The restored forest after 40 years reached a
   level similar to semideciduous seasonal forests in advanced stages of

Abstract = {Predator-prey dynamics regulate the community structure of arthropods
   and may be affected by changes in their habitat. Bottom-up effects
   influence the distribution of arboreal insects changing, in turn, the
   availability of resources and shelter for the spider assemblage. This
   study examines the effect of habitat structure (tree richness and
   density) on the assemblages of herbivorous insects and spiders along a
   gradient of secondary forest succession in a semiarid Caatinga in
   northeastern Brazil. Insect and spiders were collected by beating the
   foliage during dry and wet seasons in 2010 and 2011. Plant richness and
   density varied significantly among stages of succession. In total, 2,590
   arboreal insects were collected, corresponding to 14 orders and 151
   morphospecies. In addition, we sampled 896 canopy spiders, encompassing
   14 families and 53 morphospecies. Insect richness and abundance were
   negatively related with habitat structure, while spider richness
   increases with tree richness. We did not find any relationship among
   insects and spiders but there were differences in species composition of
   insects among all successional stages, determined by changes in
   vegetation structure. However, this effect does not extend to the
   species composition of spiders that remain similar in the different
   stages of secondary succession. We conclude that habitat structure had a
   partial bottom-up effect on arboreal insects and spider assemblages,
   indicating that this factor regulates the richness, abundance and
   species composition of arboreal insets and species richness of spiders.
   Thus, habitat structure promotes the maintenance of insects and spider
   diversity in fragments of Caatinga.},

Abstract = {Forest fragmentation is the main cause of biodiversity loss in the
   Anthropocene and it is triggering a top-down cascade effect that may
   influence leaf litter decomposition. However, the link between
   biodiversity loss and changes in ecosystem processes is not fully
   understood. We conducted an experiment to evaluate whether the exclusion
   of vertebrates affects the decomposition rates of different litter types
   (grass, a pioneer species and a mix of litters from a well preserved
   secondary forest). To answer this question, we placed litter bags inside
   artificial exclusion plots that were built in two types of vegetation
   coverage (abandoned pastureland and preserved forest) in the Atlantic
   forest of southeast Brazil. Our hypothesis is that vertebrate exclusion
   will change decomposition rates of different litter types due to the
   top-down cascade effect on soil invertebrates. We found out that
   vertebrate exclusion did not affect decomposition rates, possibly due to
   the overlap of ecological functions in the soil fauna responsible for
   the decomposition process. Furthermore, grass litter was decomposed
   faster (k value), possibly due to its initial nutrient content and hence
   litter quality which plays a significant role on decomposition rates.},

Abstract = {The Caatinga (dryland) vegetation of northeastern Brazil has become
   highly anthropized while still poorly studied, with little research
   evaluating its potential for natural regeneration. This study sought to
   compare the compositions and structures of the shrub-arboreal components
   of two Caatinga areas with different histories of anthropic disturbance

   50 m plots were established in each area, sampling all individuals >= 1
   m tall with stem diameters at ground level >= 3 cm. A total of 34
   species were sampled. The two areas had very distinct structures, with
   different dominant species: Croton blanchetianus, Poincianella
   pyramidalis, and Croton sp. in the conserved area; and Cnidoscolus
   quercifolius and Aspidosperma pyrifolium in the anthropogenically
   impacted area. The presence of cattle grazing appears to be negatively
   interfering with the recuperation of the anthropized area, which
   continues as a phytophysiognomically open site more than 30 years after

Abstract = {Questions Community assembly in regenerating forests is a key topic in
   ecology. Most studies examine the assembly process, assessing adult
   individuals along the forest succession. Although the adult stage is the
   final outcome of the assembly process, both abiotic and biotic filters
   can affect community assembly during early ontogenetic stages. Here, we
   investigate whether the functional composition and trait assembly
   patterns (trait convergence or divergence) change across ontogenetic
   stages along regenerating forest stands exposed to precipitation and
   chronic anthropogenic disturbance (CAD) gradients.
   Location Caatinga dry forest, Catimbau National Park, Pernambuco,
   Brazil.
   Methods Seeds (rain and bank), seedlings and adults of woody plant
   species were recorded across 15 forest regenerating stands (4-70 years
   since land abandonment) exposed to precipitation and CAD gradients.
   Seven functional traits related to species dispersal, establishment and
   resource use were measured for adult individuals and used to calculate
   the trait values for seeds and seedlings. Twenty old-growth forest
   stands were used as a regional flora.
   Results Functional composition (community weighted mean, CWM) varied
   across ontogenetic stages as wood density increased from seeds to
   seedlings, while seed mass increased from seeds to both seedlings and
   adults. The CWM also varied along precipitation/disturbance gradients
   but not along forest regeneration regardless the ontogenetic stage.
   Among seeds, dispersal distance increased towards wetter forest stands
   and decreased towards disturbed sites, while adult wood density
   increased from drier to wetter regenerating forest stands. Traits
   converged along the precipitation gradient but not in response to time
   since land abandonment.
   Conclusions Caatinga dry forest regeneration is functionally structured
   across ontogenetic stages mediated mostly by water availability, but not
   over time since land abandonment. The effect of water availability on
   forest regeneration across ontogenetic stages highlights the complexity
   of species assembly in human modified landscapes, imposing important
   consequences considering the expected increasing aridity in the
   Caatinga.},

Journal = {AUK},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {130},
Number = {3},
Pages = {459-468},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Amazonia now contains vast areas of secondary forest because of
   widespread regeneration following timber harvests, yet the value of
   secondary forest to wildlife remains poorly understood. Secondary forest
   becomes structurally similar to primary forest after abandonment, and
   therefore we predicted that avian movement across the interface of
   primary and secondary forest (hereafter ``the interface{''}) would
   gradually increase with time since abandonment until recovery to
   pre-isolation levels. From 1992 to 2011, we captured 2,773 understory
   birds of 10 foraging guilds along the interface of primary forest
   fragments and zero- to 30-year-old secondary forest at the Biological
   Dynamics of Forest Fragments Project near Manaus, Brazil. Our objectives
   were to understand the differences in land-use history that affect
   cross-interface movement and to determine how long it takes each guild
   to recover to pre-isolation capture rates. Across guilds, age of
   secondary forest within 100 m of the interface was the most important
   explanatory variable affecting capture rates; rates increased with age
   of secondary forest for all guilds except non-forest species. Mean
   recovery to pre-isolation was 26 years (asymmetric SE = 13 years below
   and 16 years above estimate) after secondary forest abandonment and 9 of
   10 guilds recovered within 13 to 34 years. In the slowest guild to
   recover, terrestrial insectivores, 6 of 12 species were never caught
   along the interface, and we projected that this guild would recover in
   60 years. Our recovery estimates quantify the dynamic permeability of
   the interface and contribute to a better understanding of the value of
   secondary forests as corridors among primary forest fragments. Received

Title = {Deep soil carbon loss offsets rapid aboveground carbon accumulation
   after reforestation},
Journal = {FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {548},
Month = {NOV 15},
Abstract = {Carbon (C) sequestration following land restoration is an efficient
   measure of climate change mitigation. However, most studies including
   the international ``4 per 1000 `' Initiative focus on topsoil C only.
   Here, we studied the response of deep soil C to different land
   restoration approaches. Samples were taken from rural sites in the
   Atlantic Forest Biome (Brazil), using a paired site design with
   triplicates of different 16-to-19-year-old restoration approaches of
   former arable land: reforestation, natural regeneration, and
   agroforestry sites. Adjacent arable land and a > 25-year-old secondary
   forest served as references. We determined aboveground and belowground C
   pools, including deep soil until 3 m depth. We did not find statistical
   differences among the three restoration methods for the C sequestration
   in the whole ecosystem. However, the C stock in the aboveground living
   biomass in the reforestation site was 85 +/- 15 Mg ha (-1),
   significantly exceeding the respective aboveground C in natural
   regeneration (40 +/- 13 Mg ha(-1)) and agroforestry system (25 +/- 5 Mg
   ha(-1)), respectively. This order, however, was reversed in soil, where
   reforestation caused a loss of soil organic carbon (SOC) by 27 Mg ha(-
   1) below 40 cm depth, whereas SOC stocks in the agroforestry system and
   natural regeneration site increased by 41 and 25 Mg C/ha, respectively,
   compared to arable land. We thus conclude that deep soil carbon losses
   can negate aboveground carbon accrual after land restoration, which
   emphasizes the importance of including this pool in C sequestration
   studies.},

Abstract = {The objective of this study was to evaluate the ecological relationships
   between different layers of a restored area in Vicosa, State of Minas
   Gerais. A floristic survey of the tree layer, natural regeneration and
   soil seed bank was carried out. The floristic composition between layers
   of the restored area (tree layer, regeneration and seed bank) was
   compared, and this composition was also compared to various forest
   fragments in the area; the comparisons were made through cluster
   analysis. The successional class and dispersion syndrome between layers
   of the restored area were compared by analysis of variance (ANOVA). The
   dendrogram obtained distinguished the seed bank of the other layers.
   There was no similarity between the area studied and the forest
   fragments in Vicosa. In the distribution by successional class and
   dispersal syndrome, there was significant difference between the seed
   bank and other layers of the restored area. Results evinced the
   discrepancy of the seed bank floristic compared to other layers of the
   forest, proving that the forest area is in a headmost stage of
   succession.},

Abstract = {In Mixed Rainy Forest, natural regeneration is not studied very well. In
   Rio Grande do Sul, due to anthropic actions, it IS under different
   alteration conditions, in some cases, forming fragments. This study
   aimed to analyze the floristic of natural regeneration and to verify the
   Occurrence of floristic groups]it the area where no pronounced
   alterations were found. The area with 1606,69 ha was located Lit Sao
   Francisco de Paula National Forest (among 29 degrees 23' and 29 degrees
   27 ` S; 50 degrees 23' and 50 degrees 25 ` W), displayed in 1.606,69 ha,
   in Sao Francisco de Paula municipal county, RS. In the study, 6
   permanent growing stands of PELD (Long Duration Ecological Project) were
   selected, the vegetation was inventoried, using 10 parallel strips to
   each other and perpendicular to the direction of the topographical
   position, which presented 10 m of width and 100 m of length, subdivided
   into 10 units of 100 m(2), totalizing 1 ha, where were raffled 3 sample
   units for strip to identify and measure (height and circumference) the
   individuals with Cap higher or equal to 3 cm and smaller than 30 cm. The
   lianas, creepers and herbs also had their circumferences measured and
   identified up to the species level, when possible. The density data for
   species formed a matrix (18000) used in the multivarlate analysis. The
   presence of vegetation grouping in state of natural regeneration inside
   the forest was tested by TWINSPAN Method (Two-way indicator species
   analysis). The existence of three ecological groups (G-1, G-2 and G-3)
   was proved. G-1 was characterized by good water availability and for
   having intermediate environmental characteristics, for locating in the
   topographical position regarding the medium hillside. G-2 occurred in
   the base hillside of the forest, presenting strong influence of the
   hydric saturation and subjected to sporadic overflow; and, in G-3, in
   the topographical position of the hillside higher/plateau that
   consequently doesn't suffer influence of the elevation of hydric
   saturation. The indicative species of the groups were: Sebastiania
   brasiliensis Spreng. (G-1); Matayba elaeagnoides Radek., Myrceugenia
   myrcioides Cambess O. Berg, Myrceugenia oxysepala (Burret) D. Legrand et

Abstract = {Failures in reforestation are often attributed to nutrient limitation
   for tree growth. We compared tree performance and nitrogen and
   phosphorus relations in adjacent mixed-species plantings of contrasting
   composition, established for forest restoration on Ultisol soil,
   originally covered by tropical semi-deciduous Atlantic Forest in
   Southeast Brazil. Nutrient relations of four tree species occurring in
   both planting mixtures were compared between a legume-dominated,
   species-poor direct seeding mixture of early-successional species
   ({''}legume mixture{''}), and a species-diverse, legume-poor mixture of
   all successional groups ({''}diverse mixture{''}). After 7 years, the
   legume mixture had 6-fold higher abundance of N(2)-fixing trees, 177\%
   higher total tree basal area, 22\% lower litter C/N, six-fold higher in
   situ soil resin-nitrate, and 40\% lower in situ soil resin-P, compared
   to the diverse mixture. In the legume mixture, non-N(2)-fixing legume
   Schizolobium parahyba (Fabaceae-Caesalpinioideae) had significantly
   lower proportional N resorption, and both naturally regenerating
   non-legume trees had significantly higher leaf N concentrations, and
   higher proportional P resorption, than in the diverse mixture. This
   demonstrate forms of plastic adjustment in all three non-N(2)-fixing
   species to diverged nutrient relations between mixtures. By contrast,
   leaf nutrient relations in N(2)-fixing Enterolobium contortisiliquum
   (Fabaceae-Mimosoideae) did not respond to planting mixtures. Rapid N
   accumulation in the legume mixture caused excess soil nitrification over
   nitrate immobilization and tighter P recycling compared with the diverse
   mixture. The legume mixture succeeded in accelerating tree growth and
   canopy closure, but may imply periods of N losses and possibly P
   limitation. Incorporation of species with efficient nitrate uptake and P
   mobilization from resistant soil pools offers potential to optimize
   these tradeoffs.},

Abstract = {Natural regeneration provides multiple benefits to nature and human
   societies, and can play a major role in global and national restoration
   targets. However, these benefits are context specific and impacted by
   both biophysical and socioeconomic heterogeneity across landscapes.
   Here, we investigate the benefits of natural regeneration for climate
   change mitigation, sediment retention and biodiversity conservation in a
   spatially explicit way at very high resolution for a region within the
   global biodiversity hotspot of the Atlantic Forest. We classified
   current land-use cover in the region and simulated a natural
   regeneration scenario in abandoned pasturelands, areas where potential
   conflicts with agricultural production would be minimized and where some
   early stage regeneration is already occurring. We then modeled changes
   in biophysical functions for climate change mitigation and sediment
   retention, and performed an economic valuation of both ecosystem
   services. We also modeled how land-use changes affect habitat
   availability for species. We found that natural regeneration can provide
   significant ecological and social benefits. Economic values of climate
   change mitigation and sediment retention alone could completely
   compensate for the opportunity costs of agricultural production over 20
   yr. Habitat availability is improved for three species with different
   dispersal abilities, although by different magnitudes. Improving the
   understanding of how costs and benefits of natural regeneration are
   distributed can be useful to design incentive structures that bring
   farmers' decision making more in line with societal benefits. This
   alignment is crucial for natural regeneration to fulfill its potential
   as a large-scale solution for pressing local and global environmental
   challenges.},

Abstract = {Aiming to describe coastal Atlantic Rain Forest (ARF) regeneration
   dynamics, we evaluated attributes linked to soil biota and mycorrhizal
   symbiosis in two coastal ARF sites in Florianopolis, Southern Brazil. In
   each site, we selected forest transects in early regeneration (ER) and
   advanced regeneration (AR) stages, i.e., about 20 and 50 years without
   agricultural use, respectively. Soil total organic carbon (TOC) was
   higher in AR than in ER stage. Soil microbial biomass carbon (MBC)
   varied between sites and was higher in the AR than in the ER stage.
   Basal respiration and qCO(2) rates differed between sites and were,
   respectively, higher and lower in advanced regeneration stage areas.
   Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) root colonization and AM fungal spore
   density were higher in the ER stage, with no difference between sites.
   Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for correlation between soil
   microbiological and chemical attributes showed that the variables with
   the most influence on sample separation for the first component were
   total spore number, soil MBC, root mycorrhizal colonization, and soil
   TOC. Soil pH, available P, and qCO(2) had the highest influence on the
   second component. This analysis separated samples by regeneration stage,
   and sites differed only in AR stage. PCR-DGGE analysis on DNA extracted
   from soil samples showed that AMF community structure differed more
   between sites than between regeneration stages.},

Abstract = {Under suitable conditions, deforested land used for agricultural crops
   or pastures can revert to forest through the assisted or unassisted

   development and affect its qualities, outcomes and persistence. We
   describe how the economic and policy context creates barriers for the
   development, persistence, and management of naturally regenerating
   forests, including perverse outcomes of policies intended to enhance
   protection of native forests. We conclude with recommendations for
   specific economic and policy interventions at local, national, and
   global scales to enhance forest natural regeneration and to promote the
   sustainable management of regrowth forests on former agricultural land

   richness, Shannon index and evenness between categories was tested using
   ANOVA. All 33 families were found, 63 genera, 79 species and 26,885
   individuals. Fabaceae, Araceae, Arecaceae, Acanthaceae and Meliaceae had
   higher richness. The Shannon index and Evenness were 2.63 and 0.60,
   respectively for the total area. Pariana campestris and Anthurium
   sinuatum showed higher density, size category and natural regeneration
   relative. Herb showed the highest percentage of individuals and natural
   relative regeneration and tree richest. CT1 (15 cm >= AT) was different
   from the other categories, with lower abundance and richness. It is
   concluded that the herb dominance in percentage of individuals and
   natural relative regeneration and the lower abundance and richness in
   CT1 is a consequence of the anthropic activities carried out such as the
   intensive management of acai palm (Euterpe oleracea Mart.) In the

Title = {Habitat modification and seasonality influence avian haemosporidian
   parasite distributions in southeastern Brazil},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {12},

Month = {JUN 2},
Abstract = {Habitat modification may change vertebrate and vector-borne disease
   distributions. However, natural forest regeneration through secondary
   succession may mitigate these effects. Here we tested the hypothesis
   that secondary succession influences the distribution of birds and their
   haemosporidian parasites (genera Plasmodium and Haemoproteus) in a
   seasonally dry tropical forest, a globally threatened ecosystem, in
   Brazil. Moreover, we assessed seasonal fluctuations in parasite
   prevalence and distribution. We sampled birds in four different
   successional stages at the peak and end of the rainy season, as well as
   in the middle and at the end of the dry season. A non-metric
   multidimensional scaling analysis revealed that bird communities in the
   pasture (i.e., highly modified) areas were different from those in the
   early, intermediate, and late successional areas (secondary forests).
   Among 461 individual birds, haemosporidian prevalence was higher in
   pasture areas than in the more advanced successional stages, but
   parasite communities were homogeneous across these areas. Parasite
   prevalence was higher in pasture-specialists birds (resilient species)
   than in forest-specialists species, suggesting that pasture-specialists
   may increase infection risk for co-occurring hosts. We found an increase
   in prevalence between the middle and end of the dry season, a period
   associated with the beginning of the breeding season (early spring) in
   southeastern Brazil. We also found effects of seasonality in the
   relative prevalence of specific parasite lineages. Our results show that
   natural forest recovery through secondary succession in SDTFs is
   associated with compositional differences in avian communities, and that
   advanced successional stages are associated with lower prevalence of
   avian haemosporidian parasites.},

Abstract = {This work aimed to characterize the floristic composition and structure
   of the tree community of areas in the process of environmental recovery
   in the municipality of Bocaiuva do Sul, PR. The production and
   dissemination of data and information about floristic and phytosociology
   of forest cover in two areas with distinct environmental conditions and
   interventions, is a relevant contribution to understanding the dynamics
   in tree structure in areas of environmental recovery. For this, two
   areas with different degrees of degradation were selected: Initial
   Secondary Forest (FSI), area in which there was a clear cut, removal of
   the superficial layers of the soil and revegetation with Mimosa
   scabrella. Benth; and Advanced Secondary Forest (FSA), which represents
   a fragment of Mixed Ombrophilous Forest where there was selective
   exploitation of species of commercial interest. Vegetation sampling was
   carried out in 10 plots of 150 m(2) in each area (0.15 ha), where all
   trees including dead trees with a diameter at breast height (DBH) equal
   or greater than 15 cm. In the FSI, 40 species belonging to 24 families
   were sampled, while in the FSA, 57 species belonging to 27 botanical
   families were sampled. The results showed that the vegetation structure
   in FSA is different from FSI, with lower tree density, higher basal area
   and floristic diversity.},

Abstract = {Ficus insipida Willd. (Moraceae) is a fast growing tree species of early
   successional stages in the Amazonian nutrient-rich white-water
   floodplains (varzea). The species is one of the most economically
   important low-density wood species in the community-based forest
   management project in the Mamiraua Sustainable Development Reserve
   (MSDR) in Central Amazonia, where timber species are managed using a
   polycyclic selection system with a minimum logging diameter (MLD) of 50
   cm and a cutting cycle of 25 years. In this study we analyze the
   floristic composition, stand structure and forest regeneration of a
   natural 20 year-old stand at an early successional stage and we model
   tree growth of diameter, height and volume of F. inspida based on
   tree-ring analysis to define management criteria. The volume growth
   model indicates that the preferred period for logging should be at a
   tree age of 17 years when the current annual volume increment peaks.
   This age corresponds to a diameter of 55 cm, which would be an
   appropriate MLD.},

Title = {Biomass resilience of Neotropical secondary forests},
Journal = {NATURE},

Volume = {530},
Number = {7589},
Pages = {211+},
Month = {FEB 11},
Abstract = {Land-use change occurs nowhere more rapidly than in the tropics, where
   the imbalance between deforestation and forest regrowth has large
   consequences for the global carbon cycle(1). However, considerable
   uncertainty remains about the rate of biomass recovery in secondary
   forests, and how these rates are influenced by climate, landscape, and
   prior land use(2-4). Here we analyse aboveground biomass recovery during
   secondary succession in 45 forest sites and about 1,500 forest plots
   covering the major environmental gradients in the Neotropics. The
   studied secondary forests are highly productive and resilient.
   Aboveground biomass recovery after 20 years was on average 122 megagrams
   per hectare (Mg ha(-1)), corresponding to a net carbon uptake of 3.05 Mg
   C ha(-1) yr(-1), 11 times the uptake rate of old-growth forests.
   Aboveground biomass stocks took a median time of 66 years to recover to
   90\% of old-growth values. Aboveground biomass recovery after 20 years
   varied 11.3-fold ( from 20 to 225 Mg ha(-1)) across sites, and this
   recovery increased with water availability (higher local rainfall and
   lower climatic water deficit). We present a biomass recovery map of
   Latin America, which illustrates geographical and climatic variation in
   carbon sequestration potential during forest regrowth. The map will
   support policies to minimize forest loss in areas where biomass
   resilience is naturally low (such as seasonally dry forest regions) and
   promote forest regeneration and restoration in humid tropical lowland
   areas with high biomass resilience.},

Abstract = {This study was set out with the objective of analyzing successional
   process in areas which are deforested and dominated by Pteridium
   aquilinum in the Serra da Mantiqueira mountain range, by researching the
   natural regeneration of shrub and tree species and evaluating both
   disturbance history and the edaphic conditions on the natural
   regeneration community. This research investigated two abandoned pasture
   areas in Bocaina de Minas county exposed to natural regeneration
   intervals ranging from six years (area named 6A) to twenty years (area
   named 20A). The inventory occurred from sixty plots of 10 m(2), where
   all samples surveyed were between 0.15 m and 3 m high. All samples were
   identified and both the diameter in ground level and total height of the
   specimens were measured. The survey totaled 1,159 samples and 53
   species. Melastomataceae was registered with the highest species
   richness and the highest specimen abundance. The two sampled areas
   showed species composition differences, with Jaccard similarity
   coefficient equal to 3.7\%. The canonical correspondence analysis showed
   the correlations between natural regeneration stratum and non-labile
   phosphorus and clay in the 6A area. On the other hand, the 20A area
   showed correlations between plant regeneration and the K, P, Ca2+, Al3+
   levels, with higher pH levels, and with the sum of exchangeable bases.
   In addition, the vegetation surveyed in area 20A was correlated with
   higher Pteridium population density. The results showed that the
   dominance of Pteridium aquilinum leads to successional process under
   inhibition, in which the ferns act negatively on the richness and
   abundance of shrub populations. It was also confirmed the Pteridium's
   affinity to steep areas, mainly in higher altitudes, where the soil is
   acid, as well as its preference to disturbed areas. Moreover, we
   highlight the fragilities of the mountain environments and the
   importance of preserving natural vegetation, as well as the bracken
   management as a strategy for forest restoration.},

Abstract = {Planting of native trees has been adopted in many tropical regions
   worldwide as a central forest restoration method, but little is known
   concerning the role that these planted species play in catalyzing forest
   regeneration beneath their canopies. We investigated the role of
   animal-dispersed tree species in catalyzing the regeneration of woody
   species in the understory of restoration plantings. We assessed both the
   density and richness of tree seedlings within plots located beneath the
   canopy of both animal-dispersed and abiotic-dispersed tree species
   planted in three riparian forest restoration sites with ages of five,
   six and eight years. The proportion of animal-dispersed tree seedlings
   increased with plantation age. The richness of animal-dispersed tree
   seedlings was higher beneath animal-dispersed trees in the
   eight-year-old planting. The density of animal-dispersed tree seedlings
   was higher under animal-dispersed trees when sites were analyzed
   altogether. The top three species in regeneration density beneath the
   canopy were animal-dispersed trees, and from the top ten, seven were
   animal-dispersed species. We suggest that animal-dispersed pioneer trees
   which facilitate natural regeneration and promote a high density and
   richness of woody species beneath their canopies should be considered as
   ``framework{''} species for tropical forest restoration. (C) 2015

Journal = {TROPICAL CONSERVATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {4},

Pages = {300-316},
Abstract = {Succession in the Brazilian Amazon depends on prior land-use history.
   Abandoned clearcuts become dominated by Cecropia trees and exhibit
   species replacements characteristic of natural succession in forest
   lightgaps. In contrast, abandoned pastures are dominated by Vismia trees
   that inhibit natural succession for a decade or more. Here we explore
   how advance regeneration and limited seed dispersal may contribute to
   the arrested succession in Vismia-dominated stands. Vegetation surveys
   showed that every Vismia stem in 3-8 year old Vismia stands originated
   as a re-sprout. In Cecropia stands, all tree species, including Vismia,
   originated mostly from seeds, after deforestation and abandonment. The
   100\% re-sprouts of Vismia in the abandoned pastures confirms that
   Vismia dominance results from re-sprouting following pasture fires. Seed
   rain in both Vismia and Cecropia dominated stands was limited almost
   exclusively to second growth species already reproducing in those
   stands, suggesting that the bats and birds foraging there were not
   bringing mature forest seeds into the second growth, but simply feeding
   and depositing local second growth species. As dispersal was similar in
   both stand types, dispersal differences cannot account for the ongoing
   dominance of Vismia relative to the ongoing successional transitions in
   Cecropia stands. Overall, advance regeneration in the form of Vismia
   re-sprouts is much more likely to be the driver of Vismia dominated
   succession than differential dispersal of mature forest seeds. In order
   to avoid extensive forest conversion into unproductive Vismia wastelands
   in the Amazon Basin, forestry permits for harvesting timber should
   include restrictions on subsequent anthropogenic degradation, such as
   conversion to pasture and prescribed burning.},

Abstract = {Long-term ecological success of large-scale restoration programs planned
   for the next decades will rely on genetic diversity (GD) of reintroduced
   or colonizing species, a limiting factor in highly fragmented
   landscapes. In small and isolated natural remnants or restoration areas,
   substantial reduction in population's size or connectivity may lead to
   local extinctions due to the accumulation of deleterious recessive
   alleles and ongoing reduction of fecundity, plant vigor, recruitment
   success, and adaptive potential. Despite the paramount role of GD for
   species persistence, its levels in restoration programs are poorly
   known. We assessed the GD of four model tree species (different
   succession stages, dispersal, and pollination syndromes) from the
   Brazilian Atlantic Forest, comparing two high-diversity restoration
   plantations, one forest fragment and one conserved remnant. Contrary to
   the expectation that the plantation strategies adopted in the
   restoration programs could result in genetic composition homogenization,
   we found that restoration areas established heterogeneous genetic groups
   with similar levels of neutral GD and inbreeding to those observed in
   natural forest remnants. This pattern was consistent across the four
   functionally different tree species, despite some species
   idiosyncrasies. For instance, we observed lower allelic richness in
   early successional species in restoration sites, suggesting that some
   species may be more prone to reintroduction with lower GD. Thus, we
   advocate the use of high GD levels in restoration to support
   biodiversity conservation in human-modified landscapes, thus reinforcing
   the role of ecological restoration for recovering the diversity of
   genesthe basic constituent of biodiversity.},

Abstract = {The nutrient cycling is influenced by the successional stage. However,
   there is disagreement in relation to the pattern of this dynamic. The
   present study aimed to evaluate the chemical attributes of the topsoil
   and litterfall in two abandoned plantations of the eucalyptus Corymbia
   citriodora in different stages of Atlantic Rainforest succession (Pk
   young plantation; PM: mature plantation) at the Unia'o Biological
   Reserve, RJ. We tested the hypothesis that there is an increase in the
   nutrient contents in the topsoil and litterfall, the amount of
   litterfall and nutrient input to the soil, as the process of forest
   succession advances. We sampled the topsoil (depth of 0-10 cm; dry
   season/2008, rainy season/2008, dry season/2009, rainy season/2010) and
   litterfall (0.49 m(2) traps; 1.0 m above the forest floor; twice a
   month; 366 days) in five plots 5 m x 20 m) in the areas of PJ and PM.
   The topsoil in the PM area presented higher content of total C and N, H
   + Al, and Mn. On the other hand, the values of pH, C/N ratio and content
   of K, Fe, and Zn were higher in the topsoil in the PJ area. No clear
   pattern was detected in terms of the P and Cu content in the topsoil.
   The annual litterfall was higher in the PM area, which presented higher
   content of total N and Mg, while higher C/N ratio and content of both P
   and Ca occurred in the PJ area. We did not detect differences in terms
   of total C in litterfall. The input of C, N, P, K and Mg to the soil
   were higher by litterfall in the area of PM, and there were no
   differences between PJ and PM in relation to the Ca input. We partly
   corroborated the tested hypothesis in relation to the nutrient content
   in topsoil, litterfall and nutrient input, and we completely
   corroborated the hypothesis in terms of litterfall.},

Title = {Canopy Leaf Traits, Basal Area, and Age Predict Functional Patterns of
   Regenerating Communities in Secondary Subtropical Forests},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN FORESTS AND GLOBAL CHANGE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {4},
Month = {JAN 29},
Abstract = {Secondary forests originate from natural regeneration after fallow
   (succession) or restoration. Species assembly in these communities,
   which can affect ecosystem functions and successional trajectories, is
   very unpredictable. Trait-based trajectories can shed light on the
   recovery of ecosystem functions and enable predictions of how the
   regenerating communities will change with forest age. Regeneration
   communities are affected by initial conditions and also by canopy
   structure and functional traits that alter dispersers' attractiveness
   and coexistence mechanisms. Here we evaluated how community functional
   traits change over time and tested if functional diversity and
   composition of the established canopy, as well as the structure of the
   canopy and forest age, influence the functional structure of
   regenerating tree communities when compared to their reference forests.
   For this, we calculated dissimilarity in trait composition
   (community-weighted means) and in functional diversity of regenerating
   communities of each succession/restoration stand, using the tree stratum
   of nearby mature forests as baseline values. Functional trait
   information comprises leaf, wood density, and reproductive traits from
   tree species. Our community data contain information from natural
   successional forests and restoration sites, in the South-Brazilian
   Atlantic Forest. Predictor variables of functional dissimilarities were
   forest age, canopy structural variables, canopy functional composition,
   and functional diversity. Results showed leaf traits (leaf dry matter
   content, leaf nitrogen content, leaf nitrogen-phosphorus ratio) and seed
   mass varying with forest age. Canopy functional composition based on
   leaf traits and total basal area significantly predicted multiple trait
   functional dissimilarity between the regeneration component of secondary
   forests and their reference community values. Dissimilarity increased
   when the canopy was composed of species with more acquisitive traits.
   Difference in functional diversity was only influenced by forest age.
   Mid-stage secondary forests showed lower functional diversity than
   early-stage forests. Our results indicated the importance of canopy
   traits on the natural regeneration of secondary subtropical forests. If
   functional similarity with reference forests is a desired objective in
   order to recover ecosystem functions through natural regeneration, leaf
   functional traits of canopy trees that establish or are planted in
   degraded areas must be considered in the successional processes.},

   derived from P-HH, P-HV and P-vv images. An analysis of the spatial

   formations in terms of biometric parameters. For this thematic
   stratification, a contextual Markovian classification technique (ICM)
   was used in polarimetric P-band images, to delineate primary forest and
   regeneration areas, in association with basal area intervals. The
   advance that was reached with the treatment of P-band data could improve

Abstract = {Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi colonization and response were studied
   in seedlings of 80 native woody species belonging to different
   successional groups from the Tibagi River Basin, Parana State, south
   Brazil. This study includes data from 43 native woody species already
   published. The results with 80 species did not differ from the results
   of the 43 species. The experiment was carried out in a greenhouse in
   plastic bags filled with a mix of subsoil (85\%) and sand (15\%),
   inoculated or not with spores of native AM fungi obtained from
   rhizosphere soil of different native tree species in an area with
   natural vegetation dominated by woody pioneer species. The successional
   groups were represented by 16 pioneer, 20 early secondary, 29
   late-secondary and 15 climax species. The AM response and colonization
   in the greenhouse were 5.9 and 4.2 times greater in the early
   successional species than in the late-successional species,
   respectively. Seedlings of 49 woody species were collected in the
   interior under the canopy of the tropical forest of the Mata dos Godoy
   State Park and in a cleared area dominated by woody pioneer species. The
   percentage of AM colonization in the field was 54.9, 40.4, 7.2 and 3.1
   for the pioneer, early secondary, late-secondary and climax species,
   respectively. The response to AM inoculation was strongly and directly
   related to AM colonization in the greenhouse and field and inversely
   related to seed weight. The AM colonization in the greenhouse was
   strongly and directly related to AM colonization in field. The
   late-successional species showed lower AM colonization and response than
   early successional species. The accentuated mycotrophism of the early
   successional species may be involved in their establishment, growth,
   survival and early forest structuring on low-fertility soils.},

Abstract = {Natural regeneration is key for large-scale forest restoration, yet it
   may lead to different biodiversity outcomes depending on
   socio-environmental context. We combined the results of a global
   meta-analysis to quantify how biodiversity recovery in naturally
   regenerating forests deviates from biodiversity values in reference
   old-growth forests, with structural equation modeling, to identify
   direct and indirect associations between socioeconomic, biophysical and
   ecological factors and deviation in biodiversity recovery at a landscape
   scale. Low deviation within a landscape means higher chances of multiple
   sites in naturally regenerating forests successfully recovering
   biodiversity compared to reference forests. Deviation in biodiversity
   recovery was directly negatively associated with the percentage of
   cropland, forest cover, and positively associated with the percentage of
   urban areas in the surrounding landscape. These three factors mediated
   the indirect associations with rural population size, recent gross
   deforestation, time since natural regeneration started, mean annual
   temperature, mean annual water deficit, road density, land opportunity
   cost, percentage cover of strictly protected forest areas, and human
   population variation in the surrounding landscape. We suggest that
   natural forest restoration should be prioritized in landscapes with both
   low socioeconomic pressures on land use conversion to pasturelands and
   urban areas, and high percentage of forest cover.},

Abstract = {The forest understory is made up of resident and transitory species and
   can be much richer than the canopy. With the purpose to describe the
   contribution of these groups to the woody understory, five Atlantic
   Forest fragments were selected and studied in Northeastern Brazil. In
   order to analyze the understory's structure, the sample included woody
   individuals with circumference at breast height (CBH) smaller than 15cm
   and circumference at ground level (CGL) greater than 3cm, regardless of
   height. The recorded species were quantified and classified into
   functional stratification categories (resident and transitory), and the
   floristic similarity between the understory and the tree stratum was
   calculated. Species' importance in the understory was analyzed by height
   and total natural regeneration classes based on a regeneration index.
   The understory was richer in species (median=63.8, SD=21.72, n=5
   fragments) than the tree stratum (43.8, 18.14, 5), and the similarity
   between these components was relatively high (median=0.54, SD=0.09). The
   results also showed that the studied understory in the forest fragments
   was mainly composed by transitory species (median=67.01\%, SD=3.76),
   that were well distributed among height classes and had the highest
   densities, which may favor their future presence in the canopy's
   structure and composition. The typical understory species were grouped
   into two strata: the lower understory, made up of species that generally
   do not reach more than 4m in height (mostly species from families
   Piperaceae, Rubiaceae and Melastomataceae); and the upper understory,
   with intermediate heights between the lower understory and the canopy,
   but with average heights that were not higher than 10m (mainly of
   species from families Anonnaceae, Clusiaceae and Myrtaceae). These
   families' richness was commonly used as an indicator of the vegetation's
   successional stage; however, such results must be seen with caution as
   they show that these families co-occurred and were highly important in
   different strata. Studying the understory is fundamental because it
   represents a floristically rich stratum with a unique structure, which
   promotes the natural regeneration of the tree stratum. Rev. Biol. Trop.

Journal = {BIOTROPICA},

Volume = {48},

Pages = {586-597},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Caatinga vegetation continues to be converted into mosaics of secondary
   forest stands, but the affect of this process on biodiversity has not
   yet been examined. We used 35 regenerating and old-growth stands of
   Caatinga to examine the recovery of plant assemblages subsequent to
   slash-and-burn agriculture and cattle ranching/pasture in northeastern
   Brazil. Plant assemblages were contrasted in terms of community
   structure (stem density/basal area/species richness/diversity),
   functional (leaf habit/reproductive traits) and taxonomic composition.
   Soil attributes were also examined to infer potential drivers for
   cross-habitat differences. As expected, plant assemblages clearly
   differed across a large set of community-level attributes, including all
   trait categories relative to leaf habit and reproduction (pollination
   syndrome/floral color, size, type). Overall, old-growth forest stands
   supported distinct and more diverse assemblages at the plot and habitat
   level; e.g., long-lived tree species were almost exclusively found in
   old-growth forest stands. For most attributes, plant assemblages
   subsequent to pasture exhibited intermediate values between those
   exhibited by old-growth forest and those of agriculture-related stands.
   Surprisingly, soils exhibited similar fertility-related scores across
   habitats. Our results indicate that: (1) sprouting/resprouting
   represents an important mechanism of forest regeneration; (2)
   assemblage-level attributes suggest recovery at distinct rates; (3)
   forest regeneration implies community-level changes in both vegetative
   and reproductive functional attributes, including directional changes;
   (4) Caatinga is not able to completely recover in a period of 15-yr
   following land abandonment; and (5) historical land use affects recovery
   rates and successional pathways/taxonomic trajectories. Seasonally dry
   tropical forests may intrinsically cover a wide range of patterns
   relative to successional model, recovery rates and successional
   pathways.},

Abstract = {The objective of the study was to evaluate the floristic and structural
   composition of an area located in a section of secondary Forest, in the
   municipality of Dona Francisca, RS state. To do so, 50 permanent plots
   with a dimension of 10 x 20 m (200 m(2)) were installed in a systematic
   way, 10 m apart and 40 m between tracks, totaling 1 ha. All individuals
   with CAP >= 15.7 cm were identified and sampled and the
   phytosociological estimators were calculated. The species accumulation
   curve was used to verify the sample adequacy. For the calculation of
   diversity and dominance estimators, the Shannon Index (H `) and Pielou
   Equability (J') were used. Subsequently, the floristic and structural
   composition was evaluated through the Distributed Correspondence
   Analysis (DCA). It was also verified the diameter and histopic
   distribution of the tree community, and for the species, with importance
   value above 5\%, the distribution in classes of DAP. Statistical
   analyzes were performed in the R program. 65 tree and shrub species were
   identified with 2,045 individuals distributed in 31 botanical families.
   The species with a value of importance above 5\% were Casearia
   sylvestris (14, 04 \%), Nectandra lanceolata (12, 86 \%), Cupania
   vernalis (9, 57 \%), Guarea macrophylla (7,29 \%) and Ocotea puberula
   (5.07 \%). The values for diversity and dominance were, respectively,
   2.91 nats.ind(-)(1) and 0.69, indicating that the area has low diversity
   and dominance of few species and that by DCA it is possible to verify
   that the plots are homogeneously distributed in the forest. The diameter
   distribution represented the expected behavior for the arboreal
   community with J-inverted tendency and the majority of the trees
   presented height concentrated in the middle stratum of the forest. Only
   Nectandra lanceolata and Ocotea puberula did not present negative
   exponential curve from the five species analyzed. It was possible to
   observe the mosaic of tree species distributed in the forest section. In
   addition, there is a predominance of individuals in the first classes of
   DBH and height, which characterizes the resilience of the area after the
   disturbance and its capacity for natural recovery. It also indicates the
   fluctuations and stability of species in ecological succession of a
   forest in an intermediate stage of regeneration.},

Title = {Green deserts, but not always: A global synthesis of native woody
   species regeneration under tropical tree monocultures},
Journal = {GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {30},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Tree monocultures constitute an increasing fraction of the global tree
   cover and are the dominant tree-growing strategy of forest landscape
   restoration commitments. Their advantages to produce timber are well
   known, but their value for biodiversity is highly controversial and
   context dependent. Therefore, understanding whether, and in which
   conditions, they can harbor native species regeneration is crucial.
   Here, we conducted meta-analyses based on a global survey of the
   literature and on a database created with local, unpublished studies
   throughout Brazil to evaluate the regeneration potential of native
   species under tree monocultures and the way management influences this
   regeneration. Native woody species regeneration under tree monocultures
   harbors a substantial fraction of the diversity (on average 40\% and
   68\% in the global and Brazilian surveys, respectively) and abundance
   (on average 25\% and 60\% in the global and Brazilian surveys,
   respectively) of regeneration observed in natural forests. Plantations
   with longer rotation lengths, composed of native tree species, and
   located adjacent to forest remnants harbor more species. Pine
   plantations harbor more native individuals than eucalypt plantations,
   and the abundance of regenerating trees is higher in sites with higher
   mean temperatures. Species-area curves revealed that the number of woody
   species under pine and eucalypt plantations in Brazil is 606 and 598
   species, respectively, over an aggregated sampled area of ca. 12 ha. We
   highlight that the understory of tree monocultures can harbor a
   considerable diversity of regenerating native species at the landscape
   and regional scales, but this diversity strongly depends on management.
   Long-rotation length and favorable location are key factors for woody
   regeneration success under tropical tree monocultures. Therefore, tree
   monocultures can play a role in forest landscape restoration and
   conservation, but only if they are planned and managed for achieving
   this purpose.
   In this study, we assessed the woody natural regeneration under tree
   monocultures reported in studies conducted in the tropical region. We
   found out that native tree monocultures, tree plantations adjacent to
   forest remnants, and longer rotation lengths harbor more species, while
   the abundance of regenerating trees is higher in sites with higher mean
   temperatures. According to our results, tree monocultures can play a
   role in forest landscape restoration and conservation, but only if they
   are planned and managed for achieving this purpose.image},

Abstract = {Forest landscape restoration (FLR) is the intentional intervention in
   the forest landscape to recover biological diversity and ecosystem
   functions, improving human well-being in altered landscapes. The general
   objective of the present study was to understand the state of the art of
   research that potentially contributes to FLR practices in the Amazon. We
   carried out a comprehensive literature review using the Web of Science
   platform, considering papers published between 2000 and 2020 to
   understand the state of knowledge on restoration strategies that support
   FLR in the nine Amazonian countries and the nine states of the Brazilian
   Amazon. We selected 362 articles that met our inclusion criteria after
   analyzing 1,205 articles. We found that Brazil, followed by Peru,
   Colombia, and Ecuador, has the largest number of published articles on
   FLR. Agroforestry (37.88\%) and natural regeneration (30.35\%) were the
   most common FLR strategies across all countries and Brazilian states.
   Most studies investigated ecological functioning (33\%), vegetation
   structure (31\%), and tree diversity (15.5\%). Forest restoration
   strategies (forest plantation, natural regeneration, or silviculture)
   are reported in most studies (57.23\%), in comparison to restoration
   strategies of agricultural lands (agroforestry systems or improved
   fallow; 42.77\%). We found an increase in publications describing
   restoration strategies over time in the Amazon, especially from 2012
   onwards, with a peak in 2018. Future studies in the Amazon region should
   address socioeconomic issues and expand the geographic scope within the
   Amazon, as well as the FLR strategies and the ecosystem attributes
   investigated.},

Abstract = {Riparian forests are important for the structure and functioning of
   stream ecosystems, providing structural components such as large woody
   debris (LWD). Changes in these forests will cause modifications in the
   LWD input to streams, affecting their structure. In order to assess the
   influence of riparian forests changes in LWD supply, 15 catchments
   (third and fourth order) with riparian forests at different conservation
   levels were selected for sampling. In each catchment we quantified the
   abundance, volume and diameter of LWD in stream channels; the number,
   area and volume of pools formed by LWD and basal area and tree diameter
   of riparian forest. We found that riparian forests were at a secondary
   successional stage with predominantly young trees (diameter at breast
   height < 10 cm) in all studied streams. Results showed that basal area
   and diameter of riparian forest differed between the stream groups
   (forested and non-forested), but tree density did not differ between
   groups. Differences were also observed in LWD abundance, volume,
   frequency of LWD pools with subunits and area and volume of LWD pools.
   LWD diameter, LWD that form pools diameter and frequency of LWD pools
   without subunits did not differ between stream groups. Regression
   analyses showed that LWD abundance and volume, and frequency of LWD
   pools (with and without subunits) were positively related with the
   proportion of riparian forest. LWD diameter was not correlated to
   riparian tree diameter. The frequency of LWD pools was correlated to the
   abundance and volume of LWD, but characteristics of these pools (area
   and volume) were not correlated to the diameter of LWD that formed the
   pools. These results show that alterations in riparian forest cause
   modifications in the LWD abundance and volume in the stream channel,
   affecting mainly the structural complexity of these ecosystems
   (reduction in the number and structural characteristics of LWD pools).
   Our results also demonstrate that riparian forest conservation actions
   must consider not only its extension, but also successional stage to
   guarantee the quantity and quality of LWD necessary to enable the
   structuring of stream channels.},

Abstract = {This study aimed to highlight the role, implications, and future outlook
   of shifting cultivation in Amazonia - an ancient practice widely
   utilized in the region. Shifting cultivation involves the turnover of
   cultivated areas, interleaving agricultural species with natural
   regeneration, and is fundamental to the survival of rural Amazonian
   populations. However, the slash-and-burn process leads to a reduction in
   biodiversity, soil fertility, and aggregation. Additionally, it poses
   negative impacts on the flora and fauna, as the allotted time for fallow
   in the diverse Amazonian contexts may not be sufficient due to the
   necessity for food production. This results in the expansion of fields
   and, consequently, an increase in degraded area. In this context, the
   use of ecological recovery techniques, both active and passive, becomes
   essential for maintaining ecosystem services. The secondary forest
   formed after shifting cultivation exhibits high biodiversity,
   contributing to carbon sequestration and storage. The future
   sustainability of shifting cultivation in Amazonia depends on achieving
   a balance between forest maintenance and food production. This requires
   active participation from the agricultural community and the
   implementation of low environmental impact technologies or techniques.},

   counts in both areas comprising 96 h of total sampling. Richness,
   abundance and diversity were greater at the regeneration area, possibly
   due to the heterogeneity of habitats, the consequent niche diversity,
   and the connectivity between patches of vegetation. Functional groups
   were also distinct between both sites, including species composition,
   feeding guilds and foraging strata. The regeneration site presented a
   higher abundance of omnivorous, granivorous and nectarivorous species,
   which might be related to the presence of sparser canopy, multiple
   opportunities for the development of grasses and forest-edge plants
   blooms in open areas. In contrast, higher abundance of invertebrate
   predators and frugivorous was found in the forested area, further
   confirming the relationship between those guilds and dense vegetation
   cover with closed canopies.},

Title = {Revealing the Permanent and Transient Plant Understory in Gallery
   Forests in the Cerrado of Central Brazil},
Journal = {FOREST SCIENCE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {69},
Number = {3},
Pages = {254-264},

Abstract = {The understories of tropical forests comprise complex communities and
   can be divided into permanent understory, where the generally
   shade-tolerant plant growth forms are less developed in height, and
   transient understory, where young tree individuals are only temporarily
   present. Despite a high contribution to species richness in tropical
   forests, the understory is poorly studied. Here, we examined the species
   composition, richness, structure, diversity, and the relative
   contribution of growth forms in permanent and transient understories of
   gallery forests in the Brazilian Cerrado. A total of 211 species
   distributed into sixty-seven families and 153 genera were sampled. The
   most species-rich family was Rubiaceae, and Miconia was the genus with
   the highest species richness. The species Hildaea pallens had the
   highest importance in the forests. The best-represented growth forms
   were tree seedlings, followed by shrubs and lianas. The transient
   component of the understory in gallery forests was the most diverse.
   However, in terms of species relative cover, both transient and
   permanent understory species contributed equally to the understory
   structure, mainly due to the high cover of Poaceae species. Our study is
   the first to examine composition, structure, diversity, and growth forms
   in the permanent and transient understories of gallery forests. Study
   Implications: Our study is innovative in describing the plant community
   attributes of gallery forest understories in the Brazilian Cerrado. The
   understories of tropical forests comprise complex communities and can be
   divided into permanent and transient understory. The transient component
   of the understory in gallery forests was the most diverse, represented
   by seedlings and young tree specimens. However, in terms of species
   relative cover, both transient and permanent understory species
   contributed equally to the understory structure. Here, we provide
   evidence that may be useful to initiatives seeking to conduct ecological
   restoration and conservation of gallery forests in the Cerrado.},

Abstract = {We investigated if high irradiance imposes stress conditions and
   differently affects the performance of species from the
   early-successional light-demanding group and if the costs associated
   with plasticity underlie the trade-off between growth and survival.
   Survival, growth, chlorophyll a fluorescence, and carbon stable isotopic
   ratio (delta C-13) were measured in seedlings of four tree species in a
   restoration area in the Atlantic Forest under full-sun exposure and
   partial shading treatments. The maximal quantum yield of PSII indicated
   stress conditions mainly in the full-sun exposure treatment (values from
   0.72 to 0.81). The delta C-13 ranged from -31.9 to -30.4 parts per
   thousand, but did not differ between treatments for three species,
   suggesting that C assimilation in initial restoration conditions is
   stressful even in shade. The survival scaled negatively with growth and
   plasticity adjustments. We conclude that early-successional species do
   not form a homogenous species group because they differ in functional
   responses to stress, and phenotypic plasticity, with these variations
   showing a strong link with the trade-off between growth and survival.
   This information should be taken into account for species selection in
   restoration programs.},

Abstract = {Scarabaeinae dung beetles are indicator insects used in the evaluation
   of the ecological effects caused by changes in habitat structure and
   ecosystem integrity resulting from environmental degradation. We
   compared dung beetle diversity in conserved restinga forests (coastal
   tropical moist broadleaf forest) and in reforested areas of various ages
   during the rainy and dry seasons, on the coast of Paraiba State, Brazil.
   A total of 3,634 individuals comprising 14 species were collected. In
   the reforested areas there was a gradual increase in species abundance
   relative to the area's age, but in the conserved restinga the abundance
   of individuals was 10-20 times higher than that recorded in areas of
   recent reforestation. The highest species richness was found in the
   conserved restinga and in the oldest reforested area (16 years old)
   during the rainy season. During the dry season, when environmental
   conditions do not seem to favor adult survival, most of the species were
   found in the conserved restinga forest. The dung beetle community
   structure was related to the increases in habitat heterogeneity in the
   successional processes of the reforested areas. Our results suggest that
   reforested areas act as a source of and refuge for dung beetle species.},

Title = {Natural forest regrowth under different land use intensities and
   landscape configurations in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest},
Journal = {FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {508},
Month = {MAR 15},
Abstract = {Natural forest regrowth is considered the most cost-effective strategy
   to promote large-scale forest restoration, but regrowth trajectories and
   their consequences for nature and people can be highly variable. This
   uncertainty may obstruct devoting land, time and resources in promoting
   this restoration approach. Process-based models allow to simulate forest
   regrowth under different scenarios and may thus support decision making
   to manage areas in ways that maximize forest restoration based on
   natural forest regrowth. In the present study, we used the process-based
   model LandClim to assess the following questions:1) How does land use
   intensity affect forest growth, aboveground biomass (AGB) and tree
   species diversity in agricultural landscapes in the long term? 2) How do
   different land use configurations affect the structure and expansion of
   second-growth forests? We based our study on six 4 x 4 km agricultural
   landscapes, dominated by pastures and sugarcane, in the Brazilian
   Atlantic Forest region. We parameterized and validated LandClim for the
   study region by comparing model outputs with published estimates and
   information from field data collected across the six landscapes. We then
   simulated natural forest regrowth under different land use intensities
   in the six landscapes and analyzed how land use intensity and landscape
   configuration affect AGB, tree species diversity and the spatial
   dynamics of second growth forests. Our results showed negative effects
   of increased land use intensity on landscape biomass accumulation due to
   limited forest cover expansion. Landscapes dominated by sugarcane had
   lower forest regrowth potential than pasture-dominated landscapes due to
   lower likelihood of abandonment, and limited rates of seed availability
   and seedling growth. Land use intensity and landscape configuration were
   also important factors for tree diversity changes. However, temporal
   patterns differed, and while AGB reached a plateau after 100-150 years,
   tree diversity peaked between 30 and 70 years. Thus, the effects of land
   use intensity and landscape configuration on forest AGB and tree
   diversity take decades to be fully expressed, highlighting the
   importance of a long-term commitment in restoration projects.},

Abstract = {This study aimed to evaluate the dynamics of the physical and chemical
   recovery of the substrates of waste dumps of different ages undergoing
   natural regeneration, in a calcary mining in Salto de Pirapora - SF
   Brazil. Characterization of the vegetation, vegetation and physical and
   chemical cover of the substrates of the abandoned waste dumps since 1994
   and 2013 and the soil of a native forest fragment adjacent to the mining
   was carried out. Twelve plots of 10 x 10m were allocated in each
   environment. It was verified that the soil cover rate with herbaceous,
   grassy, regenerating and litter of the sterile stacks are similar to the
   native forest fragment. The same was observed for the physical
   characterization of soil resistance to penetration, soil moisture
   content and relative light index. For the chemical characteristics, in
   all areas sampled there is aluminum deficiency which, consequently,
   presented low potential acidity and alkaline pH. The CEC of the
   substrates of the waste dumps presented values similar to the CEC of the
   native forest fragment, with abundance in some essential nutrients,
   indicating the possibility of vegetation development in the sterile
   stacks and the contribution of the natural regeneration to the
   substrates. Thus, the plant-soil relationship via natural regeneration
   in the sterile piles contributed to the improvement of the edaphic
   quality of the substrates over time, being a potential form of recovery
   in calcary mining. Thereby, the Fabaceae predominated on the waste
   dumps, especially Leucaena leucocephala, which, despite being an exotic
   species, is relevant for the current recovery stage of the substrates.},

Abstract = {Forest management can result in net losses of carbon stock. To quantify
   the impact of the management it is important to assess losses or gains
   of carbon, as well as the sustainability of the management system. This
   study quantified the impact management under a Small-Scale Sustainable
   Forest Management Plan, which is a recently created category of
   authorized management for small managers in the state of Amazonas,
   Brazil. Impact was quantified on the number of individuals, the biomass
   of natural regeneration, and the damage to the remaining trees 2 months
   after logging. The impact of these changes on carbon stock was
   estimated. The study was carried out in the Uatuma Sustainable
   Development Reserve, Amazonas, Brazil, where two areas of small-scale
   forest management and one control were evaluated. Average total carbon
   stock previous to logging was estimated at 161.25 +/- 9.66 MgC ha(-1).
   Two months after logging, reductions were found of 3\% in one managed
   area (MA1) and 8.3\% in the other (MA3), including the carbon stock from
   the harvested timber. For each harvested tree, the logging caused damage
   to 12 trees in MA1 and four trees in MA3. The reductions in carbon stock
   and number of trees damaged per harvested tree were less than the
   reductions found for higher impact forest management and other
   experiences in community forest management. No significant alteration
   was found in the carbon stock of natural regeneration. However, there
   was an increase in the number of individuals, both in the logged areas
   and in their respective control areas.},

Abstract = {This work aimed at evaluating the natural regeneration dynamics in two
   springs in process of recovery in Lavras-MG, Surrounded in
   December/2003. To do that, two springs were carried out from August/2005
   (18 months) to April/2006 (24 months). 122 plots In the total of 5 x 5m
   (25 m(2)) were plotted, being 76 plots in spring I and 46 plots in
   spring 2. The plots were distributed systematically throughout all the
   area of the springs. All individuals with height larger than 0.10 m and
   DBH lower than 5 cm were identified, having their diameters and height
   measured. Floristic composition, structural analyses and natural
   regeneration dynamics were Studied. In the total, 524 individuals from
   24 family and 55 species were sampled. The Asteraceae family was
   distinguished in species number in spring 1 and the families Fabaceae
   Faboideae, Myrtaceae and Solanaceae in spring 2. The species Baccharis
   dracunculifolia and Vernonia ferruginea presented the highest natural
   regeneration indexes in spring 1, while the species Vernonia polyanthes
   and Nectandra nitidula in spring 2. The higher diversity index was
   registered for the spring 2 in the second evaluation, having an increase
   from 3,324 (first evaluation) to 3,384 (second evaluation). The
   floristic similarity index registered between the springs was of 20.0\%
   and 18.5\% for the evaluations 1 and 2, respectively. During the time of
   monitoring, it was verified a significant increase of 33.33\% and 15.8\%
   in individuals number sampled in springs I and 2, respectively. The
   natural regeneration method presents potential for the recovering of the
   vegetation of the two springs; however, it is necessary the adoption of

Abstract = {To survive new microclimatic conditions of a forest gap environment,
   plant species must physiologically and structurally adjust. A
   morpho-anatomical, ultrastructural and ecophysiological study was
   performed at three different times in a forest gap that was created by
   illegal selective logging. The study followed the early successional
   Actinostemon verticillatus and the late-successional Metrodorea
   brevifolia, to elucidate the adaptive strategies of acclimation to gaps.
   Additionally, Schinus terebinthifolius was included in the study in
   order to test the plasticity of a pioneer species that grows on forest
   edges, where this species had higher values of leaf thickness, leaf mass
   area and succulence. M. brevifolia had succulent leaves, high leaf area
   and a thin cuticle. A. verticillatus presented the densest leaves and
   was the only species to show leaf morpho-anatomical plasticity.
   Ultrastructural and physiological differences were observed only in A.
   verticillatus and M. brevifolia leaves from the gap: increase in the
   stroma volume, oil droplets, plastoglobuli, photochemical and
   non-photochemical quenching. Photosynthetic efficiency showed that the
   early stages of gap formation are the most critical. Acclimation
   strategies of A. verticillatus suggest this species invests in the
   efficiency of photosynthesis by increasing its leaf thickness, leaf mass
   area and in water content maintenance by increasing the density of its
   leaves, at the expense of gas exchange, was compensated by a high
   density of stomata. M. brevifolia compensates for the higher cost of
   leaves and lower leaf plasticity with ultrastructural changes that are
   used to adjust the photosynthetic process, which promotes a shorter leaf
   payback time.},

Volume = {45},

Abstract = {Enrichment planting is a technique that is gaining recognition for its
   potential to restore native forests. Due to the steep economic
   trade-offs involved and dearth of silvicultural and ecological knowledge
   about native flora, however, it remains unclear whether it has promise
   for widespread application. Focusing on growth performance, this study
   explores the restoration potential of twenty-one native tree species 3
   years after planting in the understory of a rubber plantation in
   southern Bahia, Brazil. We tested the effects of slope, aspect,
   successional guild and basal area of the overstory rubber trees on the
   enriched species' height, root collar diameter, and diameter at breast
   height. Height was the growth parameter that most differentiated
   species, with Parkia pendula, Sloanea monosperma, and Tachigali
   densiflora being three of the most successful species. Pioneer species
   grew faster than the non-pioneer species. Overstory basal area was the
   most important variable influencing the performance of the planted tree
   seedlings, while aspect and slope were less important. For every
   additional unit of basal area per hectare of rubber, there was an
   incremental decrease in the growth rates of the enrichment species. This
   suggests that the tree species are likely limited by available light,
   and that there are distinct trade-offs between overstory rubber density
   and understory tree species growth that are important to consider when
   accelerating forest recovery by using enrichment planting techniques.},

Abstract = {Ecological interactions among species, both positive and negative, have
   a strong influence on the structure of plant communities and their
   comprehension can contribute to the improvement of techniques for
   ecological restoration. Facilitation of natural regeneration by trees
   planted in riparian forest restoration in the Cerrado region was the
   subject of this study. We sampled 91 trees ten years old, belonging to
   six species representing different functional groups by seed dispersal
   syndrome, deciduousness, and Nitrogen-fixing ability. Gaps created by
   failures in the initial planting were sampled as controls. Density and
   richness of regenerating plants were use as response variables. The
   species, their functional attributes, tree size and the environment
   under the canopy (grass biomass, light flux and soil moisture) were used
   as explanatory variables. Density and richness of woody plants under the
   different species varied greatly among species. Variation was partially
   explained by deciduousness, but mostly by canopy size and shape, which
   modify the availability of light to plants in the understory.
   Restoration of riparian forests in the cerrado region by planting trees
   should prioritize species with the following attributes: large canopy,
   fast growing, and a certain level of deciduousness. Such species can
   trigger natural regeneration processes under their canopies and
   therefore should accelerate restoration.},

Title = {Overstory trees in excess: A threat to restoration success in Brazilian
   Atlantic forest},
Journal = {FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {449},
Month = {OCT 1},
Abstract = {Tree planting is the most widely used technique for tropical forest
   restoration because it accelerates the recovery of forest structure and
   ecosystem functioning. Despite the importance of tree size distribution
   to the ecological function and habitat quality of restored forests, it
   has received little attention. Here we ask if the structure of reference
   forests has been recovered by planting tree seedlings and discuss the
   implications of skewed tree-size distributions for sustainability of
   restored forests. We sampled 11 tropical forest sites that had undergone
   restoration for between 16 and 53 years after planting tree seedlings
   and nine reference ecosystems (old-growth, secondary and degraded
   forests) in Brazilian Atlantic forest, and compared them by the
   abundance of individuals in five diameter classes. Restored forests
   presented 83\% greater abundance of large trees ( > 20 cm DBH), 41\%
   lower abundance of saplings (1 <= DBH < 5 cm) and 43\% lower abundance
   of small trees (5 <= DBH < 10 cm). The abundance of smaller individuals
   (DBH < 1 cm), however, did not differ between restored and reference
   forests, indicating successful colonization of the understorey. Low
   mortality in the large class (DBH >= 20 cm) results in excess of big
   trees, which constrains recruitment of small plants to the intermediate
   size classes, likely due to asymmetric competition for light. The excess
   of large trees demonstrates that gap dynamics can take longer to
   naturally re-establish in these even-aged forests, likely due to the
   high density of long-lived trees planted at the same time. Thinning may
   be a possible adaptive-management strategy to reduce the density of big
   trees and stimulate recruitment of intermediate size classes.},

Abstract = {Planting seedlings remains the most popular method of forest
   restoration, but passive restoration may become a new promise to reduce
   costs, despite concerns about its efficacy. Here, we present a study of
   a riparian forest recovery program in the Southern Atlantic Forest,
   Brazil. The objective was to compare planting seedlings and passive
   restoration eight years since restoration started and assess the
   influence of cattle presence in the restoring areas. We analyzed the
   structure, diversity, and composition of the woody community in the
   upper (canopy) and lower strata (understory) versus six environmental
   variables, including edaphic, landscape and geographical variables,
   restoration method (planting seedlings versus passive restoration),
   presence of cattle inside the restoration areas, and presence of
   adjacent crop plantations. Passive restoration generated a more diverse
   woody community and a higher proportion of climax and zoochoric species
   in the lower stratum than active restoration. Cattle presence was
   significantly associated with lower species richness and density of
   plants, as well as a higher proportion of pioneer species and low
   proportion of zoochoric and climax species. The results suggest that
   cattle can delay forest succession, besides reducing diversity. Passive
   restoration should be considered suitable for the region, and the
   efficiency of cattle exclusion needs to be improved.},

Month = {SEP 15},
Abstract = {Due to the global magnitude of forest degradation and deforestation and
   the high cost of ecological restoration, several approaches have been
   used to prioritize conservation or restoration areas based on different
   objectives and criteria. The present work aims to develop a
   multicriteria approach to defining forest restoration priority areas in
   the Itacaitinas River basin, eastern Amazon, that maximizes the criteria
   equitably. The selected criteria were: improve forest connectivity,
   provide climatic refuges for biodiversity, mitigate the impacts of
   deforestation on streamflow, and improve the probability of natural
   regeneration. A strong difference between selected areas was observed
   when the criteria of forest connectivity and mitigate the impact on
   streamflow were considered separately, but greater equity among the
   criteria was achieved using the multicriteria approach. The most
   priority areas were concentrated near protected areas. The method used
   provides a flexible framework, and different criteria or subarea
   selections can be applied for different purposes to facilitate adaptive
   management. Analyzing forest restoration prioritization on rural
   properties can provide guidance for conserving and restoring
   biodiversity at the landscape scale while complying with legal
   requirements.},

   of eucalyptus and physical and chemical properties of the soil were
   evaluated. Chemical properties were similar for the three areas, where
   the results of analysis indicate acid and dystrophic soils. Physical
   properties indicate clay soils without limitations to plant growth. A

Title = {Effects of topographic variability and forest attributes on fine-scale
   soil fertility in late-secondary succession of Atlantic Forest},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL PROCESSES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {10},
Number = {1},
Month = {SEP 25},
Abstract = {Background Understanding how soil fertility changes due to topographical
   conditions and forest attributes is an essential premise for local-scale
   forest management practices. We evaluated the effects of topographic
   variables and forest attributes on soil fertility along a local
   topographical gradient in a Brazilian Atlantic Forest. We hypothesised
   that soil fertility is positively affected by topographic variability
   and forest attributes (structure and diversity). We used tree species
   richness, composition, abundance, and aboveground biomass as forest
   attributes. We analysed two 1-ha forest patches with contrasting
   topographical conditions. We used different linear mixed effects models
   (LMMs) to test the main effects of different forest attributes and
   topography variables on soil fertility. Results The results showed that
   higher topographic variability determines soil fertility along a
   fine-scale gradient. The first two axes of the PCA explained 66.8\% of
   the variation in soil data, with the first axis (PCA(1)) explaining
   49.6\% of the variation in soil data and positively correlating with
   fertility-related soil properties. The second axis (PCA(2)) explained
   17.2\% of the variation in topographical data and positively correlated
   with convexity (the elevation of a plot minus the average elevation of
   all immediate neighbour plots) and elevation. Our best models showed
   that topographic variables (elevation and convexity) are the main
   predictors that affect fine-scale soil fertility. Conclusions Our study
   demonstrates that the topographic variability, mainly elevation and
   convexity, determines fine-scale soil fertility in an Atlantic Forest.
   These results advance our understanding that context-dependent
   conditions based on topography and soil properties have a high
   variability at a fine scale, which can influence variations in forest
   attributes (i.e., species distribution, diversity and structure of tree
   communities). In addition, the information generated in this research
   may be important for planning forest restoration activities (passive and
   active) based on the high variability of environmental variables at a
   fine scale.},

Abstract = {Successional gradients are ubiquitous in nature, yet few studies have
   systematically examined the evolutionary origins of taxa that specialize
   at different successional stages. Here we quantify successional habitat
   specialization in Neotropical forest trees and evaluate its evolutionary
   lability along a precipitation gradient. Theoretically, successional
   habitat specialization should be more evolutionarily conserved in wet
   forests than in dry forests due to more extreme microenvironmental
   differentiation between early and late-successional stages in wet
   forest. We applied a robust multinomial classification model to samples
   of primary and secondary forest trees from 14 Neotropical lowland forest
   sites spanning a precipitation gradient from 788 to 4000mm annual
   rainfall, identifying species that are old-growth specialists and
   secondary forest specialists in each site. We constructed phylogenies
   for the classified taxa at each site and for the entire set of
   classified taxa and tested whether successional habitat specialization
   is phylogenetically conserved. We further investigated differences in
   the functional traits of species specializing in secondary vs.
   old-growth forest along the precipitation gradient, expecting different
   trait associations with secondary forest specialists in wet vs. dry
   forests since water availability is more limiting in dry forests and
   light availability more limiting in wet forests. Successional habitat
   specialization is non-randomly distributed in the angiosperm phylogeny,
   with a tendency towards phylogenetic conservatism overall and a trend
   towards stronger conservatism in wet forests than in dry forests.
   However, the specialists come from all the major branches of the
   angiosperm phylogeny, and very few functional traits showed any
   consistent relationships with successional habitat specialization in
   either wet or dry forests.Synthesis. The niche conservatism evident in
   the habitat specialization of Neotropical trees suggests a role for
   radiation into different successional habitats in the evolution of
   species-rich genera, though the diversity of functional traits that lead
   to success in different successional habitats complicates analyses at
   the community scale. Examining the distribution of particular lineages
   with respect to successional gradients may provide more insight into the
   role of successional habitat specialization in the evolution of
   species-rich taxa.},

Abstract = {The aim of this study was to evaluate the dynamics of the seed rain in
   two Floristic groups formed in a remnant of Subtropical Seasonal Forest.
   The clusters were characterized by successional stage of the forest,
   namely group I (Secondary Forest in Intermediate Stage-FSEM), with a
   predominance of early secondary species, and group II (Secondary Forest
   in Advanced Stage-FSEA), with a predominance of late secondary species.
   Seed rain was evaluated in 70 collectors of 1 m(2), randomly distributed
   in the two groups, whereas in group I were installed 15 collectors and
   in group II, due to its greater area, 55 collectors. The deposited
   material was collected monthly from October 2008 to October 2010. The
   dynamics of seed rain was assessed by the density of seeds of each
   species of dispersal and seasonal production. We used the nonparametric
   Test of Wilcoxon Sum of Orders (W) to determine statistical differences
   in the mean density of seeds in each year of assessment for each patch
   of forest. Seed rain in the remaining studied during three years of
   study, was represented by 114 species and higher seed production
   occurred in 2008 (1632-seeds.m(-2) in group I and 1270-seeds.m(-2) in
   group II), mainly due to the occurrence of high production Chusquea
   ramosissima Lindm., Dasyphyllum spinescens (Less.) Cabrera,
   Vernonanthura discolor (Spreng.) H. Rob. Only in the second year (2009)
   observed statistical differences in mean density between the two groups
   (FSEM=565.6 seeds.m(-2) and FSEA=274 seeds.m(-2); Z=1.96 and tabulated;
   W FSEM x FSEA = 2.248). Zoochorous species predominated in the study
   area, and periods of increased seed production were the winter and
   spring. The seed rain proved important mechanism for natural
   regeneration of remnant forest and is affected by climate conditions and
   successional stage of the forest.},

Title = {Beyond the surface: microbiological and biochemical attributes as
   indicators of soil quality in Atlantic Forest ecosystem},
Journal = {CATENA},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {246},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The objective of this study was to determine the biochemical and
   microbiological attributes in areas with different vegetation covers
   (mature forest, secondary forest, and sugar cane monoculture) and
   seasonal changes, and to compare the sensitivity of these attributes
   types (mycorrhizal, enzymatic, and carbon attributes) in response to
   changes in vegetation cover and season. Soil samplings were conducted
   over two years (one per semester, during the dry and wet periods of 2007
   and 2008) in three types of areas: (I) mature forest; (II) secondary
   forest; and (III) sugar cane crop. The enzymatic activity of fluorescein
   diacetate, dehydrogenase, saccharase, basal carbon respiration, the
   carbon content of microbial biomass, the microbial coefficient, total
   and easily extracted glomalin soil-related proteins, mycorrhizal
   colonization, the number of glomerospores, total organic carbon, fulvic
   and humic acid content, and the fulvic/humic acid ratio were analyzed.
   In general, mycorrhizal parameters were more sensitive in distinguishing
   areas with different types of vegetation cover. Additionally, carbon
   stocks in areas of mature and secondary forest were higher compared to
   areas cultivated with sugar cane. The study reveals that mycorrhizal
   properties, such as root colonization and GRSP fractions, are more
   sensitive indicators of soil health than soil C attributes, providing a
   cost-effective alternative for evaluating soil health in the Atlantic
   Forest. The confirmed hypothesis supports the effectiveness of
   microbiological activity and C dynamics in discerning significant
   changes between sugar cane cultivation and forested areas. The study
   underscores the vital role of conserving forested areas, serving as
   crucial carbon reservoirs, and emphasizes the potential for enhanced
   sustainability through conservation practices and rapid soil function
   recovery in secondary forests within the Atlantic Forest.},

Abstract = {Large-scale forest restoration relies on approaches that are
   cost-effective and economically attractive to farmers, and in this
   context agroforestry systems may be a valuable option. Here, we compared
   ecological outcomes among (1) 12-15-year-old coffee agroforests
   established with several native shade trees, (2) 12-15-year-old
   high-diversity restoration plantations, and (3) reference old-growth
   forests, within a landscape restoration project in the Pontal do
   Paranapanema region, in the Atlantic Forest of southeastern Brazil. We
   compared the aboveground biomass, canopy cover, and abundance, richness,
   and composition of trees, and the regenerating saplings in the three
   forest types. In addition, we investigated the landscape drivers of
   natural regeneration in the restoration plantations and coffee
   agroforests. Reference forests had a higher abundance of trees and
   regenerating saplings, but had similar levels of species richness
   compared to coffee agroforests. High-diversity agroforests and
   restoration plantations did not differ in tree abundance. However,
   compared to restoration plantations, agroforests showed higher abundance
   and species richness of regenerating saplings, a higher proportion of
   animal-dispersed species, and higher canopy cover. The abundance of
   regenerating saplings declined with increasing density of coffee plants,
   thus indicating a potential trade-off between productivity and
   ecological benefits. High-diversity coffee agroforests provide a
   cost-effective and ecologically viable alternative to high-diversity
   native tree plantations for large-scale forest restoration within
   agricultural landscapes managed by local communities, and should be
   included as part of the portfolio of reforestation options used to
   promote the global agenda on forest and landscape restoration.},

Title = {Feedback loops drive ecological succession: towards a unified conceptual
   framework},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL REVIEWS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {99},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The core principle shared by most theories and models of succession is
   that, following a major disturbance, plant-environment feedback dynamics
   drive a directional change in the plant community. The most commonly
   studied feedback loops are those in which the regrowth of the plant
   community causes changes to the abiotic (e.g. soil nutrients) or biotic
   (e.g. dispersers) environment, which differentially affect species
   availability or performance. This, in turn, leads to shifts in the
   species composition of the plant community. However, there are many
   other PE feedback loops that potentially drive succession, each of which
   can be considered a model of succession.While plant-environment feedback
   loops in principle generate predictable successional trajectories,
   succession is generally observed to be highly variable. Factors
   contributing to this variability are the stochastic processes involved
   in feedback dynamics, such as individual mortality and seed dispersal,
   and extrinsic causes of succession, which are not affected by changes in
   the plant community but do affect species performance or availability.
   Both can lead to variation in the identity of dominant species within
   communities. This, in turn, leads to further contingencies if these
   species differ in their effect on their environment (priority effects).
   Predictability and variability are thus intrinsically linked features of
   ecological succession.We present a new conceptual framework of
   ecological succession that integrates the propositions discussed above.
   This framework defines seven general causes: landscape context,
   disturbance and land-use, biotic factors, abiotic factors, species
   availability, species performance, and the plant community. When
   involved in a feedback loop, these general causes drive succession and
   when not, they are extrinsic causes that create variability in
   successional trajectories and dynamics. The proposed framework provides
   a guide for linking these general causes into causal pathways that
   represent specific models of succession.Our framework represents a
   systematic approach to identifying the main feedback processes and
   causes of variation at different successional stages. It can be used for
   systematic comparisons among study sites and along environmental
   gradients, to conceptualise studies, and to guide the formulation of
   research questions and design of field studies. Mapping an extensive
   field study onto our conceptual framework revealed that the pathways
   representing the study's empirical outcomes and conceptual model had
   important differences, underlining the need to move beyond the
   conceptual models that currently dominate in specific fields and to find
   ways to examine the importance of and interactions among alternative
   causal pathways of succession. To further this aim, we argue for
   integrating long-term studies across environmental and anthropogenic
   gradients, combined with controlled experiments and dynamic modelling.},

Abstract = {The forests of southeastern Amazonia are highly threatened by
   disturbances such as fragmentation, understory fires, and extreme
   climatic events. Large-bodied frugivores such as the lowland tapir
   (Tapirus terrestris) have the potential to offset this process,
   supporting natural forest regeneration by dispersing a variety of seeds
   over long distances to disturbed forests. However, we know little about
   their effectiveness as seed dispersers in degraded forest landscapes.
   Here, we investigate the seed dispersal function of lowland tapirs in
   Amazonian forests subject to a range of human (fire and fragmentation)
   and natural (extreme droughts and windstorms) disturbances, using a
   combination of field observations, camera traps, and light detection and
   ranging (LiDAR) data. Tapirs travel and defecate more often in degraded
   forests, dispersing much more seeds in these areas {[}9,822 seeds per
   ha/year (CI95\% = 9,106; 11,838)] than in undisturbed forests {[}2,950
   seeds per ha/year (CI95\% = 2,961; 3,771)]. By effectively dispersing
   seeds across disturbed forests, tapirs may contribute to natural forest
   regeneration-the cheapest and usually the most feasible way to achieve
   large-scale restoration of tropical forests. Through the dispersal of
   large-seeded species that eventually become large trees, such frugivores
   also contribute indirectly to maintaining forest carbon stocks. These
   functions may be critical in helping tropical countries to achieve their
   goals to maintain and restore biodiversity and its ecosystem services.
   Ultimately, preserving these animals along with their habitats may help
   in the process of natural recovery of degraded forests throughout the
   tropics. in Portuguese is available with online material.},

Abstract = {This research aims to describe the process of ecological succession by
   associating the decomposition stages of pig carcasses with flies from
   the Calliphoridae family (Diptera). For this, 6 pig carcasses were
   exposed in Maranhao's Cerrado, utilizing metal cages with sawdust trays
   to catch immature specimens and ``suspended traps{''} to capture adults.
   Adults of the Hemilucilia benoisti Seguy, and Hemilucilia townsendi
   Shannon species were only associated with the swelling stage. Chrysomya
   megacephala (Fabricius) was associated with 2 stages (black putrefaction
   and fermentation). The species Chloroprocta idioidea
   (Robineau-Desvoidy), Chrysomya albiceps (Wiedemann), Cochliomyia
   macellaria (Fabricius), and Lucilia eximia (Wiedemann) were associated
   with 4 of the 5 stages of decomposition, the latter being the only 1
   associated with the initial stage. The larvae abandoned the carcasses to
   pupate from the second stage of decomposition, with L. eximia being the
   only 1 leaving the carcasses in the swelling stage, and C. albiceps the
   only 1 associated with both the fermentation and dry stages. Our
   findings indicate that calliphorid species can help forensic
   investigators estimine the post-mortem interval of cadavers in
   situations similar to those detailed in this study. Since there was a
   link between adult and immature species and certain stages, they can be
   used as indicators in future forensic investigations.},

   Recovery of ant diversity in the Atlantic forest of Brazil},

Abstract = {The extent to which secondary forests occupying degraded and abandoned
   lands provide suitable habitat for forest-adapted species is an
   important conservation issue in times of vanishing old growth forests.
   We used ants (Hymenoptera: Formicidae), a functionally important and
   diverse group of invertebrates, to investigate the recovery of soil taxa
   during secondary forest succession in the Atlantic Forest of Southern
   Brazil. We compared the resilience of epigeic vs. hypogeic ant
   assemblages. For this purpose we established 27 sites that encompassed a
   chronosequence from pastures to old growth forests on two contrasting
   soil types. Our results are based on a collection of 35508 individuals
   in 40 genera.
   Richness and composition of ant assemblages in secondary forests have
   recovered slowly and have not approached conditions typical of old
   growth forests. The distribution of genera along the successional stages
   was arranged in a nested pattern where ant genera of younger
   successional stages were a subset of genera present in older stages.
   Edaphic conditions had no influence on the recovery process. Overall,
   richness of ants was lower at study sites with water-logged soils than
   at sites where soils did not exhibit hydromorphic properties. The
   hypogeic ant assemblage recovered more slowly than the epigeic
   assemblage.
   Our results show that secondary forests do not act as refuges for many
   forest-adapted animals which are currently restricted to discontinuous
   patches of old growth forest in the highly endangered Atlantic Forest of
   Brazil. Moreover, estimated recovery times of 50 to several hundred
   years suggest it would take much longer than previously presumed for
   complete recolonization. (c) Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Seed banks play an important role in the resilience of potential
   anthropogenic areas and are influenced by seasonal variation. The
   spatial and temporal heterogeneity of the forests influences the
   richness and density of the soil seed bank, but there is a hypothesis
   that such influence can be changed in anthropogenic areas, where we
   expect to find lower richness and seed density in relation to the seed
   bank of mature forests. The richness and seasonal density of seeds in
   the soil depth of a young caatinga forest, 17 years after an
   agricultural activity was abandoned, were evaluated and compared with
   those of a mature forest. The study was conducted at the Instituo
   Agronomic de Pernambuco - IPA (Estacao Experimental Jose Nilson de
   Melo), located in Caruaru, Pernambuco, Brazil, in an area of tropical
   dry forest, known locally as ``caatinga{''}. The local climate is
   seasonal, the dry season occurring from September to February and the
   rainy season concentrated in the remaining months. The average annual
   rainfall over time (time series of 30 years) is 692mm. In each climatic
   season (rainy and dry), the seed bank was sampled in 210 20x20cm plots
   (105 in the leaf litter and 105 at 5cm soil depth). The richness and
   seed density of the soil samples were evaluated by the method of
   seedling emergence. The seed bank had 47 species, with a predominance of
   herbaceous plants. Seasonal variation in richness and seed density in
   the soil (leaf litter + soil) was not significant, but 42 species of the
   mature forest were absent from the seed bank of the young forest,
   despite 17 years of natural regeneration and its proximity to the mature
   forest. On its own, the soil has greater richness and density of seeds
   than the leaf litter. The depth of seed deposition in the soil bank of
   the young forest significantly explained 36\% of the species richness
   and 16\% of the seed density, with a significant interaction effect with
   the climatic season only on species richness, explaining 4\% of the
   variation recorded. The seed density of the young forest (1
   277seeds/m(2)) was greater than that the mature forest indicating that
   the time abandoned had not yet been sufficient for complete recovery of
   plant diversity and there is no longer any seed limitation of pioneer
   species for regeneration of the young forest.},

Number = {3},
Abstract = {Tree plantation is the most used technique for ecological restoration,
   although passive restoration requires a lower investment of resources.
   This research aimed to compare the composition and structure of the
   community of regenerant plants in areas under restoration through
   Assisted Natural Regeneration and mixed native Tree Planting, in the
   same area. We randomly placed 12 plots of 100 m(2) each and sampled all
   the regenerating individuals found within them. We compared both
   restoration methods regarding growth pattern, dispersal syndromes, and
   successional groups. In both methodologies, trees and shrubs were the
   most abundant growth forms. The pioneer successional class was the most
   abundant in number of individuals for both treatments. We concluded that
   the two restoration methods allowed the regeneration of native species.
   We propose that Assisted Natural Regeneration is a viable restoration
   strategy, capable of boosting the initial processes of the community,
   especially in a matrix surrounded by remaining forests.},

Abstract = {Because forest plantations cover an extensive area worldwide, they play
   an important role shaping current biodiversity conservation policies.
   This study evaluated plant species richness in the regenerating forest
   community beneath five 35-year-old homogeneous forest stands consisting
   of indigenous terrafirme species (Simarouba amara, Dipteryx odorata,
   Bagassa guianensis, Jacaranda copaia and Dinizia excelsa). These data
   were compared to adjacent primary forests in the Manaus region, Amazonas
   state, Brazil. These plantations are among the oldest native tree
   plantations of the Brazilian Amazon. All studied stands showed species
   richness near that of the primary forest, with the single exception
   being J. copaia. The relationship between species composition and the
   environmental variables was studied by canonical correspondence analysis
   (CCA). The CCA yielded correlations that were validated by a permutation
   test between species composition and canopy openness, nitrogen content,
   pH, base saturation and soil aluminum content. Our results showed that
   long standing homogenous plantation stands can provide high levels of
   density and species richness of the understory, comparable to those
   found in the surrounding primary forest. This finding reinforces the
   value of anthropogenic landscapes for conserving biodiversity. (C) 2013

Abstract = {The motivation for this study was the scarcity of information on
   ecological sustainability of natural forests in areas affected by
   logging. The objective was to find out if there is any difference in
   regeneration between the unlogged area and the logged area; regeneration
   among years after logging; and to evaluate the capacity of the natural
   regeneration on recovery of the floristic composition and structure of
   the logged forest. Natural regeneration was evaluated in three areas in
   different occasions (2000, 2003 and 2006) over a seven-year period at
   Rio Capim forest management unit, in the municipality of Paragominas,
   Para state. Data were collected in gaps, primary and secondary skid
   trials, and log decks and in the remaining forest, considering
   individuals from 2.5 cm to 10.0 cm diameter. Richness, abundance,
   diversity, evenness and floristic similarity were evaluated. Changes
   occurred in the floristic composition and abundance of individuals in
   DBH 2.5-10.0 cm, in the seven-year study period, mainly in the primary
   skid trials and log decks. In the remaining forest, dynamics of species
   and individuals was higher for shade-tolerant species, but in gaps, skid
   trials and log decks pioneer species were dominant. In the log decks and
   skid trails the abundance of individuals with DBH greater than 2.5 cm
   was very low. Natural regeneration in areas opened by logging showed
   only a few timber species with commercial value being influenced by the
   remaining forest. Therefore, one can suggest that seedlings (DBH < 2.5
   cm) of natural regeneration of commercial species must be assisted by
   post-harvesting silviculture; and seedlings produced in nurseries must
   be planted in gaps to guarantee a reasonable stock of commercial timber
   species for future harvests.},

Volume = {349},
Pages = {4-11},
Month = {AUG 1},
Abstract = {Soil features are an important factor influencing plant growth and
   distribution in different parts of the tropics. We hypothesized that in
   forests recovering from a disturbance, the spatial and temporal
   variation of soil proprieties could determine differences in forest
   structure and composition. We addressed this question by comparatively
   assessing the soil traits and forest structure and diversity that occur
   in two contrasting soils in second growth tropical forests of southern
   Brazil: Cambisols (well-drained and nutrient-poor soil) and Gleisols
   (periodically flooded and with greater soil Al toxicity). Three
   replicates of four combinations of four forest ages (9-11, 15-20, 40-55,
   and >100 years since abandonment) and two soil types (Cambisol and
   Gleisol) were compared, thus encompassing 21 plots that covered 2.1 ha.
   A total of 3355 individuals of 151 tree species were sampled in all
   plots. Soil characteristics changed along the succession, with Al
   toxicity increasing as the forests aged. Cambisols and Gleisols differed
   in their nutritional and structural characteristics. Forests growing in
   both soil types exhibited higher species density, individual density and
   basal area along the successional gradient, but diversity (and evenness)
   was higher in forests growing in Gleisol soils. Moreover, soil
   characteristics (sand:clay, C:N, and Al and P concentrations) and forest
   age determined the differences in community assemblies among soils.
   Considering that soil characteristics are spatially and temporally
   variable in the tropics and that these variations are poorly measured in
   successional studies, we argue that small-scale variations in soil
   characteristics can potentially be a powerful factor influencing the
   successional trajectories of second growth tropical forests in tropical
   regions. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Collecting and transplanting wild seedlings and mature plants have been
   used in restoration projects to reduce costs and increase conservation
   of local genetic material. We review the published literature on
   restoration projects that used transplanted seedlings and mature plants
   for ecological restoration. Searching the Web of Science platform using
   five keywords for articles published in 1945-2023 resulted in 621
   articles, with only 51 (9\%) of them relevant to the topic. We
   categorized these 51 publications by ecosystem type, the number and
   growth forms of species, plant survival rate, as well as the time and
   cost of transplantation. Forests and wetlands were the most researched
   ecosystems, and most articles studied tropical forests and the
   southeastern region of Brazil. Nearly half of the studies (44\%) used
   trees for transplantation, and 73\% focused on only one species. In
   wetlands, mainly aquatic herbs were transplanted (38\%). Survival was
   highest in wetlands (lakes) and lowest in temperate and tropical
   forests, regardless of the number of species or growth forms. Only three
   articles (7\%) included costs or the time frame of the process of
   transplantation or monitoring. Despite having few published studies,
   this practice has high potential for the ecological restoration of
   tropical and temperate forests. Seedlings and adult plants from natural
   regeneration can be transplanted to complement or even replace
   conventional methods of planting nursery seedlings and direct sowing.},

Journal = {LAND USE POLICY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {52},
Pages = {345-352},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Brazilian environmental law (the Forest Code) compels large landowners
   to conserve a proportion of forest on their properties, often
   necessitating restoration of degraded habitat. Sugar cane producers have
   been active participants in these restoration projects, especially in
   the northeast region where sugar cane has largely replaced the
   exceptionally biodiverse Atlantic forest. Despite the potential
   conservation importance of such restoration projects there have been few
   evaluations of their outcomes. Here, we assess sugar cane company
   restoration projects in an Atlantic rainforest region of northeast
   Brazil. Specifically, we assess the ability of restoration projects to:
   (i) restore species diversity and vegetation structure; (ii) increase
   connectivity between forest fragments, and; (iii) restore assemblage
   composition. Restored areas contained approximately half the species
   richness of remnant fragments and had a substantially different species
   composition. Moreover, the density of trees in restored areas was a
   third of that in remnants, despite a very similar height profile. The
   currently poor outcomes of Atlantic Forest restoration projects in
   northeast Brazil are a consequence of a severely limited capacity for
   natural regeneration and poor restoration practices. We conclude by
   identifying possible strategies to improve the quality of privately

Abstract = {As a large and dynamic land-use category, tropical secondary forests may
   affect climate, soils, and hydrology in a manner different from primary
   forests or agricultural areas. We investigated the saturated hydraulic
   conductivity K-sat of a Kandiudult under different land uses in
   Rondonia, Brazil. We measured K-sat at four depths (12.5, 20, 30 and 50
   cm) under (a) primary forest, (b) a former banana-cacao plantation
   (SF1), and (c) an abandoned pasture (SF2). At 12.5 cm, all three land
   uses differ significantly (alpha = 0.1), but not at the 20 and 30 cm
   depths. At 50 cm, K-sat was significantly greater in the former pasture
   than in other land uses. Lateral subsurface flow is expected during
   intense rainfall (about 30 times per year) at 30 cm depth in SF1 and at
   50 em depth in the forest, whereas the relatively low permeability at
   shallow 12.5 cm in the SF2 may result not only in lateral subsurface
   flow, but also saturation overland flow. For modelling purposes,
   recovering systems seem to have Ksat values distinct from primary forest
   at shallow depths, whereas at deeper layers (>20 cm) they may be
   considered similar to forests. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.},

Abstract = {Increasingly large proportions of tropical forests are anthropogenically
   disturbed. Where natural regeneration is possible at all, it requires
   the input of plant seeds through seed dispersal from the forest matrix.
   Zoochorous seed dispersal - the major seed dispersal mode for woody
   plants in tropical forests - is particularly important for natural
   regeneration. In this study, covering a period of more than 20 years, we
   show that small New World primates, the tamarins Saguinus mystax and
   Leontocebus nigrifrons, increase their use of an anthropogenically
   disturbed area over time and disperse seeds from primary forest tree
   species into this area. Through monitoring the fate of seeds and through
   parentage analyses of seedlings of the legume Parkia panurensis from the
   disturbed area and candidate parents from the primary forest matrix, we
   show that tamarin seed dispersal is effective and contributes to the
   natural regeneration of the disturbed area.},

Abstract = {This study was conducted in a fragment of semideciduous seasonal forest
   (SSF), located in Sorocaba (SP, Brazil), in order to verify its
   successional stage and infer from the future composition. Our hypothesis
   was that the fragment would present regeneration with low diversity of
   species; with predominance of pioneer species of canopy and absence of
   resident species in the understory and predominance of anemochoric and
   autochoric species. We used the parcels method, considering the
   individuals in three size classes, two of them referring to rhe
   understory and one to the canopy (1 - <= 100 cm; 2 - >100 cm and
   circumference at soil height <= 15 cm; 3 - >= 15cm. We sampled 146
   species, and class 2 understory species presented the highest diversity
   levels. The similarity between the three classes was low. Considering
   the species with the highest importance values, five are pioneer and
   five are non pioneer. Contesting the initial hypothesis, these
   characteristics, plus the predominance of the zoochorich species in the
   three species, indicate that the fragment is in an intermediate stage of
   succession and has microclimatic conditions that allow the entrance and
   presence of species that need areas with more shadow. Species like
   Aspidosperma olivaceum, Cordia trichotoma, Ocotea elegans and Guarea
   guidonia, considered as non pioneer and transitory species, were sampled
   only in classes 1 and 2, which shows the future species replacement and
   the sucessional progress of the fragment.},

Abstract = {The applicability of succession models from temperate and tropical wet
   forests to threatened seasonally dry tropical forests (SDTFs) is
   questioned. Plant phenology affects ecosystem functions and changes
   along forest regeneration gradient. To investigate the recovery of
   ecological functions after disturbances in a SDTF, we recorded the
   vegetative and reproductive phenologies for trees (DBH >5cm) for 17
   months in southeast Brazil in three successional stages: early (10-15
   years after clearing), intermediate (25-30) and late (>50). The
   vegetative phenology of the 523 individuals was strongly seasonal, with
   3\% of individuals presenting green leaves in a deciduous dry season.
   Besides structural and floristic differences, phenological trends were
   similar between the later stages. Reproduction occurred with higher
   intensities in the early stage and in the advanced stages only in the
   dry season, providing key resources to local fauna. The studied SDTF is
   resilient to ecological functions, rapidly recovering functional
   processes. The integration of structural and functional knowledge of
   succession of STDFs may lead to better management of its secondary
   remnants. Our study suggests that classical forest succession theory
   developed for other ecosystems may not fully reflect the pattern of SDTF
   succession, an ecosystem that originally covered 42\% of the earth's
   tropical and subtropical landmass.},

Abstract = {Litter fall and leaf decomposition represent important functional
   processes, yet we have a limited understanding of these processes in
   disturbed and regenerating tropical habitats. Litter production,
   litterfall phenology and leaf decomposition were examined in primary
   forests, 14-19-year-old secondary forests and 4-5-year-old Eucalyptus
   urophylla plantations in the north-east Brazilian Amazon. Total annual
   litter fall was similar in primary and secondary forests, and lower in
   plantations. Leaf fall in primary and secondary forests was negatively
   associated with rainfall, and was highest in the dry season. Leaf fall
   in Eucalyptus plantations showed an opposite response, and peaked during
   the wet season. Decomposition experiments were carried out in the three
   habitats using 1200 litter bags (1 mm mesh) filled separately with
   leaves from four different species of tree, including an exotic
   plantation species (E. urophylla) and trees typical of secondary
   (Bellucia spp. and Vismia spp.) and primary forests (Bertholettia
   excelsa). Litter bags were re-weighed at 3-month intervals 3, 6, 9 and
   12 months after being placed on the forest floor. A repeated measures
   General Linear Model showed that litter decomposition was similar in the
   primary and secondary forest, and slowest in the Eucalyptus plantations.
   Leaves decomposed, from fastest to slowest, in the following order: E.
   urophylla > B. excelsa > Vismia spp. > Bellucia spp. There was no
   significant interaction between leaf species and habitat type. Our
   results indicate that secondary forests regenerating on abandoned and
   degraded Amazonian lands can be effective at restoring ecosystem
   processes such as litterfall and decomposition. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Title = {What is the Long-Term Effect of Bamboo Dominance on Adult Trees in the
   Araucaria Forest? A Comparative Analysis between Two Successional Stages
   in Southern Brazil},
Journal = {DIVERSITY-BASEL},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {11},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Bamboos are opportunistic species that rapidly colonize open areas
   following forest disturbance, forming dense clusters that alter the
   regenerative processes and maintain lower levels of tree diversity.
   Widespread forest degradation, especially in Latin America and Asia, and
   human-induced introduction have allowed native and non-native bamboo
   species to thrive, hindering successional pathways that would otherwise
   lead to more diverse forests; such a large-scale phenomenon is a key
   concern in the conservation of forest resources around the globe.
   Despite previous research on this phenomenon, little is known about the
   long-term effects of bamboo dominance on forest structure and
   composition and the corresponding interaction with natural regeneration.
   As such, we sought to evaluate the long-term effects of bamboo dominance
   on the dynamics of adult forest populations considering two forest types
   (Bamboo Forest-BF and Araucaria Forest-AF) over an 11-year period in the
   Embrapa Research Station in Cacador, Brazil. We monitored 20 plots (15 x
   15 m) in each forest type where we tagged, identified, and measured the
   height and diameter of all the trees taller than 1.5 m (H) and diameter
   at breast height (DBH) greater than 3.18 cm. Comparisons were based on
   forest species diversity and structure parameters. In BF, diversity of
   species increased after the bamboo die-off that occurred in 2006 with a
   subsequent reduction in the number of pioneer species overtime. However,
   secondary species remained stagnant demonstrating that recruitment and
   transition into higher size classes is restricted to the immediate
   die-off aftermath. On the other hand, plant diversity and structure in
   the relatively bamboo-free AF were stable with secondary species
   accounting for the most richness. Our results confirm that BF maintains
   significantly lower levels of diversity that are restricted to pioneer
   species; AF structure and diversity are not significantly affected by
   bamboo die-off and recolonization; and BF tree species are caught in a
   closed cycle of arrested successional development. The widespread
   presence of bamboos as dominant species in the region should become a
   part of the conversation pertaining to forest management and
   conservation in Brazil and other countries in south America and Asia.},

Journal = {RESTORATION ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Given the current global environmental crisis, restoring degraded
   ecosystems stands out among the nature-based solutions to mitigate
   climate change, reestablish ecosystem services, and maintain
   biodiversity and human well-being. The high biodiversity of the Atlantic
   Forest (AF) and its severe degradation turned it into a ``restoration
   hotspot.{''} We performed a bibliometric analysis of the research on
   restoration of the Brazilian AF to identify thematic trends, potential
   gaps, as well as networks and benefits of collaboration. We also
   explored the spatial distribution of degradation, restoration science,
   and practice within the AF. We analyzed 932 articles on the issue from
   the Web of Science platform (1990-2020). Publications abruptly increased
   in the last 15 years, first by Brazilian groups and later in
   collaboration with foreign groups. International collaboration increased
   the probability of highly cited articles. Topics addressed have changed
   greatly in their relative position over time, likely due to scientific
   advances refuting theories or invalidating failed techniques. Natural
   regeneration was the main trending topic, while forest succession was
   the main emerging topic, and ecosystem services appeared as a trending
   topic. Research and restoration initiatives were both unevenly
   distributed throughout the AF region, with the southeastern region of
   Brazil standing out (60\% of publications). The percentage of the
   original AF undergoing restoration is very low in all regions,
   regardless of scientific publications or AF extent remaining. The
   knowledge gaps pointed-climate change and functional traits-should drive
   priorities for research funding, aiming to provide robust evidence to
   support decision-making processes as well as restoration practices.},

   after shifting cultivation},
Journal = {FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {529},
Month = {FEB 1},
Abstract = {Understanding the resilience of ecosystems to different land uses is
   critical to elucidate the mechanisms un-derlying regeneration processes
   and plan more sustainable land-use systems. While these relationships
   are well understood in continuous tropical forests, they are still
   poorly comprehended in forest formations embedded in a savanna matrix,
   even though these forest systems are critical for conserving savanna
   biodiversity and water resources. We assessed the time and capacity of
   swamp gallery forests to recover after shifting cultivation, in the
   Cerrado (Brazilian savanna), investigating the role of environmental
   factors in community recovery. This shifting cultivation system uses
   slash and burn techniques and establishes drained fields of 0.3-1.2 ha
   which are culti-vated for 10 years, then left fallow for 10-65 years. To
   assess the resilience of these communities, we analyzed a chronological
   sequence of 28 secondary forests (1-65 years) and compared them with
   four old forests (reference ecosystems). We evaluated the trajectory and
   recovery time of community diversity, composition, and structure
   (height, canopy coverage, density, basal area, and biomass) as a
   function of fallow time, water table depth, and soil characteristics
   using multiple linear models. Forest fragments were considered recovered
   when their attri-butes reached the mean values of the reference forests.
   Most attributes are projected to reach the mean reference values of
   old-growth forests within nine decades, except for the proportion of
   non-pioneer species, canopy cover, and biomass. Water table depth
   influenced the trajectory and time required for recovery species
   richness and floristic composition. Soils with higher pH and higher
   nutrient availability positively influenced the recovery of non-pioneer
   species composition, while soils with lower pH and high organic carbon
   availability favored an increase in canopy height throughout succession.
   The disturbances generated by this shifting cultivation system do not
   prevent the recovery of at least 80 percent of the assessed community
   attributes in 65 years, suggesting that the resilience of secondary
   forests was not lost. Considering disturbance at similar scales, we
   recommend that these ecosystems be left fallow for at least 90 years to
   complete the recovery of ecological attributes.},

   unveiled for long-term studies. Using Landsat data from 1985-2015, we
   analyzed the surface area, spatial distribution, and age of secondary
   vegetation in Fishbone and Geometric patterns of deforestation.
   Additionally, we investigated to which extent secondary vegetation
   reduces forest patch isolation at the landscape level across time. We
   found the Fishbone pattern to consistently have more secondary
   vegetation over time than the Geometric pattern, despite having the same
   size of the deforested area. However, the Fishbone pattern showed more
   secondary vegetation area with less than 5 years old, while the
   Geometric pattern showed more area with secondary vegetation with more
   than 30 years old. Regarding spatial distribution, we found secondary
   vegetation to be more spread across the entire landscape at the Fishbone
   pattern and to consistently reduce forest patch isolation across time.
   This is congruent with the land use typically found in Geometric
   (industrial cropping and ranching) and Fishbone (fallow agriculture with
   small-scale ranching) patterns. These findings indicate that the
   Fishbone pattern of deforestation produces a more biodiversity-friendly
   landscape structure than the Geometric pattern. On the other hand, older
   secondary vegetation found in the Geometric deforestation pattern could
   indicate more carbon stocked in those landscapes. Future public policies
   of land use and occupation should consider better landscape planning and
   management to overcome this duality and create synergies between
   biodiversity conservation and secondary vegetation carbon stock.},

   Seedlings of Astronium gracile were randomly chosen in the gaps. The
   measurements were performed in 2005, 2006, 2008 and 2010. The canopy
   gaps were classified as small gaps (200-400 m(2)), medium gaps (401-600
   m(2)) and large gaps (> 600 m(2)). The seedlings from natural
   regeneration of Astronium gracile, considered as a shade-tolerant
   species, were favored by the open gaps, mainly large gaps, for growing
   up and surviving, showing potential for using in silvicultural systems
   to increase the commercial value of the forest and to allow future

Volume = {50},

Abstract = {The concept of ``naturalness{''} can be associated with conservation
   status, resilience, and biodiversity. Its most common definition relates
   to the degree to which a resource is similar to its original state.
   Hence, we developed a naturalness assessment method for the Brazilian
   Araucaria forest. We used data collected within 145 systematically
   distributed plots over an area of similar to 56 000 km(2). We selected
   five indicators to compose a unified naturalness index: (i) evidence of
   human activities inside the forest stand; (ii) abundance of
   naturalness-indicator species; (iii) standard deviation of diameter at
   breast height (Sdbh); (iv) species diversity of the understory-natural
   regeneration layer; and (v) forest stand landscape metrics. We then
   calculated the Euclidean distance between the vector generated from the
   indicators of an ordinary forest stand and the vector generated from a
   theoretical reference forest (TRF) with maximum naturalness. The reduced
   Sdbh reflected the stands' diminished structural diversity as result of
   historical logging and other ongoing human activities. Most stands
   presented average naturalness compared with the TRF. Besides the lack of
   data on undisturbed forests to thoroughly evaluate the naturalness
   index, evidence suggested that it summarized relevant forest attributes
   to the extent that protected areas presented greater naturalness than
   nonprotected areas.},

Title = {Genetic diversity of Plathymenia reticulata Benth. in fragments

Journal = {GENETICS AND MOLECULAR RESEARCH},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {16},

Month = {OCT 3},
Abstract = {Studies of genetic diversity in natural populations are important for
   the definition of conservation strategies, especially in populations
   reduced by processes of fragmentation and continuous forest extraction.
   Molecular markers stand out as interesting tools for these studies. The
   objective of this research was to characterize the diversity and genetic
   structure of Plathymenia reticulata (Fabaceae), occurring in two
   fragments of the Montana Semideciduous Forest in the southern of
   Espirito Santo State, Brazil, using inter-simple sequence repeat (ISSR)
   molecular markers. DNA samples from 149 individuals were analyzed using
   10 ISSR primers, generating 156 fragments, of which 101 were polymorphic
   (64.74\%). The individuals sampled were classified into three units:
   adult trees (A), a mixture of progenies (B), and young regenerating
   individuals (C). The number of loci used (N = 101) was greater than that
   established as optimal number (N = 88), indicating precision in
   analyses. The genetic diversity index of Nei (H' = 0.407) and the
   Shannon index (I = 0.594) were found to have high genetic diversity.
   Besides, through the diversity parameters evaluated, it was possible to
   confirm that in the areas of natural regeneration and progeny mix there
   is genetic diversity equivalent to that found in adults. The analysis of
   molecular variance indicated that most of the genetic variation is found
   within the groups (96.53\%). Genetic differentiation among adult trees
   was low (Phi(ST) = 0.03) indicating that high gene flow rates (N-m =
   12.70) are counteracting the effects of genetic drift. The data obtained
   allowed to evaluate the potential of adult trees as matrices for seed
   collection and to obtain seedlings with confirmed genetic variability.},

Title = {Plants of Distinct Successional Stages Have Different Strategies for

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PLANT SCIENCES},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {180},
Number = {3},
Pages = {186-199},
Month = {MAR-APR},
Abstract = {Premise of research.Plant functional groups of different stages of
   tropical succession are adapted to distinct environments with different
   availabilities of such resources as light, water, and nutrients. The
   sites at early-successional stages commonly have low-fertility degraded
   soils and are colonized by fast-growing shade-intolerant plant species,
   while the sites at late-successional stages usually have soils with high
   contents of organic matter and nutrients and are colonized by
   slow-growing shade-tolerant plant species. In this study, we aimed to
   assess the strategies adopted by plants for nutrient acquisition over
   tropical succession.Methodology.Grassland, shrub vegetation, and
   secondary and mature forests of an Atlantic rain forest ecosystem in
   southern Brazil were studied. Fine roots were sampled to assess length
   density, specific root length (SRL), diameter, tissue density, root-hair
   length and incidence, and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF)
   colonization. Rhizospheric and bulk soils were sampled to assess
   microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and microbial biomass nitrogen (MBN);
   basal respiration; total and labile C; and concentrations of N, P, K,
   Ca, and Mg.Pivotal results.Fine roots with longer SRL, greater incidence
   of root hairs, longer root hairs, and greater AMF colonization were
   exhibited by plants in early-successional stages in contrast with plants
   in late-successional ones. Nutrient depletion zones were detected in the
   rhizospheres of plants in early-successional stages. Fine roots from the
   late-successional sites exhibited greater diameter and tissue density.
   High values for labile C, MBC, MBN, basal respiration, and the nutrient
   accumulation zone occurred in the rhizospheres of plants in
   late-successional stages in contrast with the rhizospheres of plants in
   early-successional ones.Conclusions.Our results suggest that
   early-successional plant species invest in fine roots with morphological
   features for a highly efficient nutrient uptake and in AMF (scavenging
   strategy), whereas late-successional plant species invest in other
   chemoheterotrophic microorganisms in the rhizosphere (mining strategy)
   for nutrient acquisition.},

Title = {Feral honey bees in pine forest landscapes of east Texas},
Journal = {FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2005},
Volume = {215},

Pages = {91-102},
Month = {AUG 25},
Abstract = {In 1990 the Africanized honey bee, a descendent of Apis mellifera
   scutellata, was identified in south Texas {[}Hunter, L.A., Jackman,
   J.A., Sugden, E.A., 1992. Detection records of Africanized honey bees in
   Texas during 1990,1991 and 1992. Southwestern Entomol. 18, 79-89]. The
   potential impact of this immigrant on feral and managed colonies was the
   subject of considerable speculation. The goal of this study was to
   investigate the diversity of feral honey bee races in pine forest
   landscapes of east Texas, subsequent to immigration of A. m. scutellata.
   The specific objectives were (i) to assess the immigration of A. m.
   scutellata into east Texas pine forest landscapes and (ii) to evaluate
   the suitability of the pine forest landscape to feral honey bees. This
   mesoscale landscape study was conducted on the Sam Houston National
   Forest in east Texas. Swarm traps and aerial pitfall traps were used to
   monitor feral honey bees. Spatial databases were used to evaluate
   suitability of the pine forest landscape for honey bees.
   Scoring mitochondrial DNA type (mitotypes), we found representatives of
   A. mellifera scutellata, eastern European, western European, and A.
   mellifera lamarckii races in pine forest landscapes of east Texas. The
   conclusions that follow from this aspect of the investigation are (i)
   honey bees are a ubiquitous component of the pine forest landscape in
   east Texas, (ii) mitotype diversity persists subsequent to the
   immigration of A. rn. scutellata, and (iii) A. m. scutellata is an added
   element of the mitotype diversity in the landscape.
   To evaluate quantitatively the suitability of the pine forest to feral
   honey bees, we used a spatial database for the study area and FRAGSTATS.
   The landscape structure in 1256 ha units surrounding six swarms of honey
   bees captured in the swarm traps was examined. The metrics used to
   characterize the kind, number, size, shape, and configuration of
   elements forming the landscape, defined a heterogeneous environment for
   honey bees that included sufficient food and habitat resources needed
   for survival, growth, and reproduction. The conclusions that follow from
   this aspect of the investigation are (1) although classified as a pine
   forest, management practices and other human activities have altered the
   landscape and thereby created food and habitat resources suitable for
   honey bees, (2) the forestry practices associated specifically with road
   corridor maintenance, stream side corridor protection, RCW management,
   and Wilderness Area management introduce structural heterogeneity to the
   forest landscape which enriches the diversity and abundance of early
   successional flowering plants and provides cavity sites needed by honey
   bees, (3) ranching, fanning, and urbanization within the study area also
   create these conditions, and (4) based on inferences from
   melissopalynology, honey bees provide pollination services for a broad
   representation of native and introduced flowering plant species of the
   pineywoods ecoregion. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Deforested lands in Amazonia are usually converted into pastures and
   maintained through annual prescribed burning which depletes the soil
   seed bank. Here, we assess the effect of topography and micro-site
   conditions on the seed bank and recruitment success of tree species in
   20-year old secondary forests developing on abandoned pastures in
   Central Amazonia, Brazil. Seedling emergence, mortality, and growth were
   monitored in four 1 x 1-m sub-plots located systematically in the center
   of 21 10 x 10-m artificial canopy gaps, seven each on three different
   topographic positions - plateau, slope, and bottomland. The 84 seedling
   sub-plots were assigned to four different treatments generated by the
   combination of two litter treatments, litter intact and litter removed,
   and two soil treatments, soil turned and soil unturned. Sixteen soil
   samples were collected from the four corners of each sub-plot for
   analysis of the seed bank. There was no significant effect of topography
   on the number of seeds, although on the average, densities on the
   plateaus and the bottomlands were more than double that on the slopes.
   Seedling emergence increased 200\% with litter removal and 50\% with
   soil turning relative to respective controls. Seedling emergence was
   significantly higher in bottomlands than in slopes, and seedling growth
   was significantly higher in bottomlands and slopes than in plateaus,
   indicating that water availability may be the limiting factor for the
   recruitment success on the higher parts of relief. There were no effects
   of topography and litter removal on seedling mortality. Management tools
   that can accelerate succession on intensively used land offer options
   for fostering reforestation. Based on this study, manipulating litter
   and soil micro-environment provide viable methodological tools. (C) 2012

Abstract = {Dry tropical forests have suffered great degradation by anthropic
   activities, and many were converted to pasture or agricultural areas.
   Consequently, the soil seed bank characteristics of these areas have
   been modified, and its necessary a better understanding of the
   implications for natural regeneration of forests. In this review, the
   objective was gathering the current knowledge about the influence of
   human practices on the remaining soil seed bank of dry environments, in
   order to highlight the implications of forest resilience and dynamics.
   Bibliographical survey was carried out, from the following keywords:
   seed bank, semiarid, and dry forest. In summary, studies show that the
   soil seed bank is strongly affected by anthropogenic actions. In
   general, the soil bank of agro pastoral areas suffers species loss, and
   has a lower seed quantity when compared to areas not disturbed by
   anthropic action. Therefore, understanding the spatial-temporal dynamics
   of the seed bank in the post-use land is essential to propose strategies
   for sustainable management, and vegetation conservation, especially
   considering the predictive scenario of climate change that should
   increase the severity of droughts and, perhaps, naturally reduce the
   seed amount that annually replenishes the soil seed stock.},

   semi-deciduous seasonal Atlantic forest fragments},
Journal = {FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT},

Abstract = {The majority of tropical forests in the world have undergone or are
   still undergoing selective logging. This human disturbance is among the
   actions that most affect the dynamics of the carbon stocks of tropical
   forests and also the vegetation structure, richness, and species
   composition. One of the most widely used approaches to understand forest
   responses to this disturbance has been to compare them with other
   undisturbed forests in the given region. Here, we measure the effects of
   the selective logging history on the aboveground biomass, tree
   abundance, basal area, and wood density in four Brazilian Atlantic
   Forest fragments logged once, 35-45 years before the current sampling.
   We used two unlogged forest fragments as reference ecosystems. We found
   40\% less aboveground biomass (AGB) and 31\% lower basal area in logged
   than in unlogged forest fragments. Large trees (trees with a diameter
   greater than 50 cm) were strongly affected by selective logging, showing
   AGB, basal area, mean wood density and tree abundance values 59\%, 52\%,
   and 46\%, respectively, lower in logged forest fragments. We found an
   increase in the abundance of softwood, early-successional species in
   logged forests, where 45\% of the AGB accumulated was due to only two
   species (Astronium graveolens Jacq and Gallesia integrifolia (Spreng.)
   Harms). The opposite was observed in unlogged forest fragments, where
   two late successional hardwood species (Aspidosperma polyneuron Mull.Arg
   and Holocalyx balansae Micheli) accumulated 38\% of the AGB. Our
   findings indicate that even decades after the last logging event
   semi-deciduous seasonal Atlantic Forest fragments with a selective
   logging history may present different AGB, structure, and functional
   composition from the expected pattern for old-growth forests in the
   given region.},

Abstract = {Seed dispersal by small primates may be particularly relevant in areas
   where populations of larger frugivores have been reduced or extinguished
   by hunting and/or habitat disturbance. In this context, the aim of this
   study was to evaluate the role of the golden-headed lion tamarin
   Leontopithecus chrysomelas as a seed disperser in Atlantic forest
   remnants in Brazil. To this end, we opportunistically collected feces
   deposited during observations on the feeding behavior of two groups of
   golden-headed lion tamarins ranging in the degraded areas of the Una
   Biological Reserve, Bahia, Brazil, from February 2006 to January 2007.
   We collected 587 fecal samples, of which 524 contained seeds from 24
   plant species, distributed over 13 families. Disregarding seeds of < 3
   mm, the majority of seeds recovered were bromeliad seeds. In general,
   ingestion of seeds by golden-headed lion tamarins did not improve the
   germination proportion or decrease the germination delay of seeds, with
   the exception of Aechmea spp. seeds. The tamarins encountered different
   habitats during their daily activity period, while feeding and
   defecating. Consequently, some seeds were transported to different
   habitats including disturbed areas. Thus, the role of seed dispersal in
   combination with the daily movement pattern of L. chrysomelas
   contributes to the persistence of fruit plants and epiphyte species and
   to the natural regeneration process within Atlantic forest remnants.},

   Structure and Leaf Traits in a Tropical Dry Forest in Brazil},
Journal = {FORESTS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {15},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The structure and diversity of tropical vegetation are shaped by biotic
   and abiotic factors, which function as environmental filters affecting
   plant performance on different spatial and temporal scales. We compared
   soil (Ferrasols and Cambisols) conditions, vegetation structure and leaf
   traits (e.g., specific leaf area, polyphenols, and chlorophyll contents
   a/b and in total) in the early, intermediate and late successional
   stages of a tropical dry forest (TDF) in southeastern Brazil. For this
   purpose, we measured leaf traits of the most abundant species in the
   same 18 plots (50 x 20 m/six per successional stage) in 2009 and 2018.
   Our prediction is that tree species growing in early forests have a
   greater investment in conservative traits related to chemical defenses
   and tolerance to desiccation compared to late-stage tree species. We
   observed contrasting results when comparing the chronosequence
   differences in leaf traits both in 2009 and 2018 and the temporal
   changes along this period. Specific leaf area was lower than expected
   for all successional stages, while polyphenol content increased over
   time, contrary to other studies in TDFs. These results suggest that
   contrasting environmental factors such as soil conditions and light
   availability are responsible of the observed pattern. Total chlorophyll
   content did not change significantly, while the a/b chlorophyll ratio
   doubled in all successional stages, contrary to our prediction.
   Therefore, we suggest that the conservative-acquisitive spectrum in
   successional gradients of TDFs should be further investigated with
   time-series data for a better understanding of plant community
   assemblages.},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Functional composition is an important driver of aboveground biomass
   (AGB) variation in the tropical forest and has been demonstrated through
   the mass ratio hypotheses (MRH) that explain how dominant species and
   their functional traits have an important role in the AGB increase. We
   hypothesized that AGB stock of tree species is promoted by the
   simultaneous effects of restoration treatments and Technosol quality
   through functional trait composition. We tested the main effects of
   taxonomic, stand structural, functional attributes and abiotic factors
   undergoing different restoration methods (planting of nursery-grown
   seedlings, seeding, and natural regeneration) and the effect of
   Technosol fertilization on AGB using different linear models. The
   functional traits were based on the community-weighted mean of the
   community of values of functional traits related to MRH. Stems and
   biomass distribution were categorized into the following functional
   groups: successional strategy, dispersal syndrome, nitrogen fixation,
   wood density (WD). As expected, during early restoration stage, the
   pioneer and anemochoric species were dominants mainly represented by
   naturally regenerated stems. However, the autochoric dispersal and
   nitrogen-fixing tree species were biomass dominant groups in active
   restoration, driven mostly by Senna alata which had high abundance and
   WD. We found that high WD and active restoration methods determine
   higher AGB stock on mining tailings where natural regeneration is
   limited. We conclude that functional composition reverses the effects of
   species richness and abundance on AGB tenting the MRH. Therefore, the
   effects of functional composition and restoration methods are key
   predictors on ecosystem functioning during forest restoration.},

Title = {Does Formicidae reflect the impact of riparian forest degradation in the

Volume = {67},

Abstract = {The increasing anthropogenic pressure on Eastern Amazon makes imperative
   the diagnosis of forest degradation, particularly the effect on key
   communities within the riparian ecosystems, one of the last remaining
   Amazonian forests in Maranhao State. The Formicidae family is abundant
   in these ecosystems, plays a fundamental role in soil functions and is
   also considered a good indicator of land use changes. Therefore, this
   study aimed to determine the impact of riparian forest successional
   stages on the Formicidae richness, frequency, and composition. Sampling
   was performed during both dry and wet seasons using the TSBF method.
   Collected organisms were identified as morphospecies. Also,
   species-accumulation curves were created. Linear mixed models were used
   to evaluate the effects of seasonal, local, and successional stage on
   ant richness and frequency. Polynomial regression models were applied to
   investigate the relationship between ant richness and frequency with
   canopy cover and vegetation height. Lastly, the species composition was
   represented by the Jaccard similarity index. In total, we observed 1 940
   individuals grouped into 86 morphospecies. We obtained more than 80 \%
   of the probable species richness. Ant frequency and richness increased
   significantly, following the successional stage, with low values in the
   open areas, especially during the dry season. Canopy cover and
   vegetation height seemed to affect partially both Formicidae richness
   and frequency during the dry season. Intermediate and advanced
   successional areas presented similar species composition (with 50-shared
   species), followed by the areas of early succession (43) and anthropic
   use (34). We concluded that the elimination of riparian forests produces
   a considerable effect on the richness and frequency of the Formicidae
   family, mainly affecting them in open areas during the dry season, thus
   resulting in losses of 41 \% in richness and 56 \% in frequency in
   forest areas when they were transformed into agricultural systems.
   Nevertheless, succession restores forest structure and functions, thus
   favoring re-colonization of ant species. Formicidae reflects forest
   degradation and is a key group in monitoring programs for the
   conservation/restoration of local riparian forests.},

Abstract = {Herbivory has significant impacts on individual plants and plant
   communities, both at ecological and evolutionary time scales. In this
   context, this study aims to evaluate herbivore damage and its
   relationship with leaf chemical and structural traits, nutritional
   status, and forest structural complexity along a successional gradient.
   We predicted that trees in early successional stages support
   conservative traits related to drought tolerance (high specific leaf
   mass and phenolics), whereas trees in light-limited, late successional
   stages tend to enhance light acquisition strategies (high nitrogen
   content). We sampled 261 trees from 26 species in 15 plots (50 x 20 m;
   five per successional stage). From each tree, twenty leaves were
   collected for leaf trait measures. Phenolic content increased whereas
   specific leaf mass and nitrogen content decreased from early to late
   stages. However, leaf damage did not differ among successional stages.
   Our results partially corroborate the hypothesis that early successional
   plants in tropical dry forests exhibit leaf traits involved in the
   conservative use of water. The unexpected decrease in nitrogen content
   along the chronosequence is likely related to the fact that thinner
   leaves with low specific leaf mass could have less nitrogen-containing
   mesophyll per unit area. Mechanisms affecting herbivory intensity varied
   across scales: at the species level, leaf damage was negatively
   correlated with tannin concentration and specific leaf mass; at the plot
   level, leaf damage was positively affected by forest structural
   complexity. Herbivory patterns in tropical forests are difficult to
   detect because abiotic factors and multiple top-down and bottom-up
   forces directly and indirectly affect herbivores.},

Journal = {TROPICAL CONSERVATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {11},
Month = {OCT 31},
Abstract = {The Atlantic Forest has been threatened by frequent human disturbances
   that affect its ecological processes. Lianas are an important component
   of tropical forest dynamics and, under chronic disturbance, may
   proliferate vigorously, potentially arresting secondary succession and
   hindering forest recovery. Our study aims to analyze abundance and
   diversity of liana and trees in different life stages in a disturbed
   semidecidual seasonal tropical forest fragment in southeast Brazil. We
   sampled the species richness and relative abundance in the following
   life stages of lianas and trees: I-seed (as seed arrival and seed bank
   processes), II-seedling, III-juvenile, and IV-adult. Lianas are more
   abundant than trees after the seedling stage, while trees showed more
   rarefied species richness only at the seed rain stage. Our results show
   that dispersal does not seem to be a bottleneck for either liana or tree
   community in disturbed fragments, but competition at the seedling stage
   may give lianas advantage over trees. Lianas may proliferate abundantly
   in forest fragments, even decades after disturbance. We recommend
   interventions for the management and restoration of disturbed forest
   fragments dominated by lianas to target this life form in life stages
   where they suppress the forest community, such as after the seedling

Abstract = {Amazonia is crucial to global carbon cycle. Deforestation continues to
   be one of the main causes of the release of C into the atmosphere, but
   forest restoration plantations can reverse this scenario. However, there
   is still diffuse information about the C and nutrient stocks in the
   vegetation biomass. We investigated the carbon and nutrient stocks of
   Fabaceae trees (Inga edulis, Schizolobium amazonicum and Dipteryx
   odorata) subjected to fertilization treatments (T1 - no fertilization;
   T2 - chemical; T3 - organic; and T4 - organic and chemical
   fertilization) in a degraded area of the Balbina Hydroelectric Dam, AM
   Brazil. As an early successional species, I. edulis stocked more C and
   nutrients than the other two species independent of the fertilization
   treatment, and S. amazonicum stocked more C than D. odorata under T1 and
   T4. The mixed species plantation had the potential to stock 4.1 Mg C
   ha(-1) year(-1), while I. edulis alone could stock 9.4 Mg C ha(-1)
   year(-1). Mixing species that rapidly assimilate C and are of
   significant ecological and commercial value (e.g., Fabaceae trees)
   represents a good way to restore degraded areas. Our results suggest
   that the tested species be used for forest restoration in Amazonia.},

   Employing a pixel-based approach, Landsat-5 TM and Landsat-8 OLI data
   were used to classify landuse surrounding the INF. We reviewed records
   of agricultural expansion and environmental policies in Parana to
   explain losses and gains in vegetation cover detected in the landuse
   change analysis. During the study period the area surrounding the INF
   gained -10,000 ha of natural vegetation cover regenerated from areas
   formerly under crop or pasture cover and planted forests, but lost
   -20,000 ha, largely to agricultural expansion, likely for soybeans. We
   discuss environmental policies, particularly the Ecological ICMS (a

   the Energy Company of Minas Gerais state (CEMIG), in Itutinga, Minas
   Gerais, after 16 years of reforestation. In total, 40 plots were
   evaluated and systematically distributed in ten transects, encompassing
   a sample area of 200 m2. All shrub or tree species with a height greater
   than or equal to 10 cm were included in the inventory. To verify the
   variation of natural regeneration as a function of the distance from the
   reservoir, linear regression analyses were performed. In evaluating the
   influence of tree stratum parameters on regeneration, the Pearson
   correlation index was calculated. A total of 40 species were recorded,
   with the Fabaceae family having the greatest floristic richness. It was
   verified that the variables richness, density, and height of
   regeneration were influenced by the distance from the hydroelectric
   reservoir and by the infestation of invasive exotic grasses. The study
   suggests that natural regeneration be progressively considered, due to
   the reduction of costs in restoration projects, agility in the soil
   cover process, and increase in diversity and ecosystem services.},

Abstract = {Secondary forests cover large areas and are strong carbon sinks in
   tropical regions. They are important for ecosystem functioning,
   biodiversity conservation, watershed protection, and recovery of soil
   fertility. In this study, we used the Surface Reflectance Climate Data
   Record (CDR) product from 16 Thematic Mapper (TM)/Landsat-5 images
   (1984-2010) to continuously track the secondary succession (SS) of a
   forest following land abandonment in 1980. Changes in canopy structure
   and floristic composition were analysed using data from four field
   inventories (1995, 2002, 2007, and 2012). To characterize variations in
   brightness, greenness, spectral reflectance, and shadows with the
   natural regeneration of vegetation, we applied tasselled cap
   transformations, principal component analysis (PCA), and linear spectral
   mixture models to the TM datasets. Shade fractions were plotted over
   time and correlated with the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) and the
   normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). Because image texture may
   reflect the variability of the successional process, eight
   co-occurrence-based filter metrics were calculated for selected TM bands
   and plotted as a function of time since abandonment. The successional
   forest was compared to a nearby primary reference forest (PF) and had
   differences in the spectral and textural means evaluated using analysis
   of variance (ANOVA). The results showed increases of 35\% and 10.4\%
   over time in basal area and tree height, respectively. Species richness
   within the assemblage of sampling units increased from 14 to 71 between
   1995 and 2012, and this trend was also confirmed using an
   individual-based rarefaction analysis. Species richness in 2012 was
   still lower than that observed in the PF site, which presented greater
   amounts of aboveground biomass (336.4 + 17.0 ton ha(-1) for PF versus
   98.5 + 21.4 ton ha(-1) for SS in 2012). Brightness and greenness
   tasselled cap differences between the SS and PF rapidly decreased from
   1984 (SS at the age of 4 years) to 1991 (age of 11 years). Brightness
   also decreased from 1997 to 2003, as indicated by PC1 scores and surface
   reflectance of the TM bands 4 (near infrared) and 5 (shortwave
   infrared). Spectral mixture shade fraction increased from young to old
   successional stages with strata composition and canopy structure
   development, whereas NDVI and EVI decreased over time. Because EVI was
   strongly dependent on near infrared reflectance (r = + 0.96), it was
   also much more strongly correlated with the shade fraction (r = -0.93)
   than NDVI. Except for the image texture mean that decreased from young
   to old successional stages in TM bands 4 and 5, no clear trend was
   observed in the remaining texturemetrics over the time period of
   vegetation regeneration. Overall, due to structural-floristic and
   spectral/textural differences with the PF, the SS site was still
   distinguishable using Landsat data 30 years after land abandonment. Most
   of the spectral metric means between PF and SS were significantly
   different over time at 0.01 significance level, as indicated by ANOVA.},

Title = {Combining functional traits and phylogeny to disentangling Amazonian
   butterfly assemblages on anthropogenic gradients},
Journal = {ECOSPHERE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {10},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Environmental gradients consist of sequential changes in the physical
   and structural characteristics of a region. These allow us to follow
   species responses and tolerances under different habitat conditions.
   Among them, forest fragmentation and succession comprise the most common
   examples of forest gradients, where organismal responses require
   distinct morphological, physiological, and behavioral adaptations.
   However, environmental changes can impose ecological and evolutionary
   constraints that act on species traits, as well as on local species
   assemblies through their phylogenetic history. In this study, we
   evaluated the differences in species distribution and composition on
   fruit-feeding butterfly assemblages along forest fragmentation and
   succession gradients. We combine functional and phylogenetic methods for
   determining butterfly assemblages, and inferred species resistance and
   resilience according to habitat changes in tropical forests. We used a
   database of 471 fruit-feeding butterflies of 60 species sampled from
   different environments in the central Amazon rainforest. A total of 13
   functional traits were measured, and a phylogenetic tree was obtained
   for the sampled species. The trait-environment relationship was analyzed
   along both forest fragmentation and succession gradients, controlling
   for phylogenetic signal on species distribution and functional
   composition when necessary. Several traits presented phylogenetic
   signal, and phylogeny was also driving butterfly species distribution
   along the successional gradient. After controlling for phylogeny,
   individual characteristics related to flight speed (thoracic weight) and
   anti-predatory strategies (camouflage) increased in early-successional
   forests, with large butterflies (body length) prevailing in primary
   forests. No clear functional and phylogenetic pattern was identified for
   the fragmentation gradient. Our results are consistent with the idea
   that butterflies may be employing distinct functional strategies to
   attenuate habitat change effects. Larger butterflies, with lower
   dispersal ability, are preferentially susceptible to local extinctions
   in the early-successional environments, mainly when forested habitat and
   its resources become spatially restricted. In addition, several
   anti-predatory strategies related to conspicuous colors may be losing
   their functionality in open areas, where not being distinctive against
   the background becomes the primary defense against predation.},

Abstract = {In Brazil, as in the world, the mining sector is expanding steadily.
   Currently, the sector accounts for 11.5\% of Brazil's GDP, and the
   country is the world's fifth-largest producer of mining products. The
   environmental impacts of mining and other activities that compete for
   land use need to be evaluated. The objective of this work was to assess
   vegetation recomposition in an area where bauxite extraction occurred,
   using analysis of a vegetation index calculated from satellite images.
   The method was applied at a bauxite mine in Paragominas, Para, Brazil.
   The evaluations covered the steps of opening the area, mining
   operations, and replanting, considering three types of replanting:
   natural regeneration, traditional planting, and nucleation, for the
   period between 2013 and 2019, using 2006 as the base situation for the
   secondary forest. The results showed that the replanting method directly
   influences the vegetation index according to satellite images. Several
   factors affected the values obtained, such as operational factors and
   topsoil used. The natural regeneration method was found to produce the
   best results.

Abstract = {The Araucaria forest is Brazil's highly threatened subtropical forest
   ecosystem that has been disappearing in recent decades. Restoration
   programs involving this forest type are scarce, and there is a lack of
   scientific information on how ecological processes such as competition,
   facilitation, and seed dispersal influence natural forest restoration.
   This work aims to investigate how use of perches to attract seed
   dispersers and the influence of pioneer vegetation and soil
   fertilization could affect the colonization of woody species in a
   degraded area. An experiment was conducted in an abandoned field where
   the natural establishment of seeds and seedlings of woody species was
   monitored under factorial combinations of the following treatments: (1)
   pioneer vegetation (presence and absence); (2) soil fertility (addition
   of NPK and control); and (3) perches (presence and absence). Seed and
   seedling abundance, seed and seedling species richness, and seedling
   mortality were recorded monthly during 12 months. Seed abundance and
   species richness were significantly greater in places with perches than
   in control plots. These results were consistent over the year and more
   pronounced when the surrounding forest produced a higher amount of
   fruit. Species richness and abundance of seedlings were significantly
   greater in places with perches than in control plots, and in places with
   vegetation than without. Soil fertility did not influence seedling
   establishment. Facilitation and seed dispersal are important factors
   affecting the colonization of woody species in this subtropical area.
   Nutrient availability neither regulates the facilitation process nor
   influences species replacement during the early stages of Araucaria
   forest succession.},

Abstract = {Due to the increasing environmental degradation, the understanding of
   how reforestation and other restoration techniques function became
   fundamental to base the reestablishment of degraded ecosystems. The aim
   of this study was to perform a vegetation survey in a restoration site
   through three different techniques. The study site has 7.2 ha in a
   subtropical forest in Dois Vizinhos, Parana state, Brazil and it is
   approximately 20 m from a secondary forest fragment. The experiment
   consisted of 12 plots with three treatments (T1-3) randomly distributed
   in four blocks. T-1: natural regeneration through passive restoration.
   T-2: set of nucleation techniques. T-3: seedlings planted through
   filling and diversity lines (3x2 m). For sampling purposes, each plot
   was divided into 24 subplots. In order to evaluate plant presence, two
   years and eight months after the treatments implementation, a survey was
   conducted in three random subplots for each plot, where all plants
   taller than 50cm were identified and quantified. Native species richness
   was higher than 87\% in all treatments, whereas the presence of
   herbaceous species was higher at passive restoration and woody species
   at plantation. The most common dispersal syndromes were anemochory and
   zoochory. By comparing planted and regenerated individuals for the three
   treatments, the plantation technique had the highest Shannon diversity
   index (3.017), with 148 individuals and 53 species sampled. However,
   there was no statistically significant difference. This higher diversity
   is related to the larger number of species planted, but it is still not
   facilitating regeneration species in its understory at this age.
   Considering only regenerated individuals, nucleation showed the highest
   Shannon diversity index (2.078) with a total of 908 individuals of 40
   species, however, it wasn't statistically significant different of
   passive restoration (Shannon = 1.965) which had 2,018 individuals of 40
   species. The most floristic similar treatments were passive restoration
   and nucleation. Nucleation facilitated species natural regeneration (17
   planted and 40 regenerated species) while passive restoration showed
   high resilience, therefore the use of passive restoration can be
   considered an effective alternative since its results did not differ
   statistically from nucleation, and the main advantage of this technique
   is the reduced cost.},

Title = {Spatial determinants of Atlantic Forest loss and recovery in Brazil},
Journal = {LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {32},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Context Despite continued forest cover losses in many parts of the
   world, Atlantic Forest, one of the largest of the Americas, is
   increasing in some locations. Economic factors are suggested as causes
   of forest gain, while enforcement has reduced deforestation.
   Objectives We examine three aspects of this issue: the relative
   importance of biophysical versus anthropogenic factors in driving forest
   dynamics; role of forest mean patch age influencing areas targeted for
   losses; and what future forest mean patch age mosaic we can expect (more
   forest cover and full forest maturity?).
   Methods Three land cover maps from 1990, 2000 and 2010, were used in the
   study. We selected six biophysical and six anthropogenic spatial
   determinants to analyze by means of weights of evidence, using Dinamica
   software.
   Results Results show that forest regrowth is influenced by multiple
   factors, working in synergy. Biophysical variables are related to forest
   gain while anthropogenic are associated with loss. Clear patterns of
   regrowth on pasture and sugarcane plantations occurred, especially near
   rivers and forest patches, on steeper slopes and with sufficient
   rainfall. Forest loss has targeted both older and newer forests. Future
   projections reveal forest gain in a slow pace, followed by specific
   ecosystem service losses, due to continuous trends of older mature
   forest loss.
   Conclusions Regrowth is linked to land abandonment, and to neighboring
   environmental conditions. It is important to question which mechanisms
   will guarantee and potentiate new regrowth, thus contributing to
   landscape restoration and reestablishment of ecosystem services in the
   Atlantic Forest.},

Abstract = {Direct seeding is considered a feasible alternative for large-scale
   forest restoration, but little is known about the successional
   trajectory of tropical forests restored through direct seeding. To
   validate this method, we must understand how it changes forest structure
   and species richness and shapes the community trajectory as compared to
   the standard methods of natural regeneration and seedling planting. We
   evaluated restoration sites up to 10 years old in the Xingu river basin
   in Mato Grosso, Brazil. Our objectives were to: (i) describe changes in
   vegetation structure and richness in restored forests within the first
   decade; (ii) compare the outcome of restoration by direct seeding
   (broadcast seeding, sowing in rows, or placing seeds in holes) to
   seedling planting and natural regeneration; (iii) evaluate the influence
   of environmental variables (annual precipitation, soil phosphorus
   content, sand percentage, and soil base saturation) and the direct
   seeding technique on forest structure. We assessed species richness,
   density of individuals per size class, basal area, canopy height,
   aboveground biomass, and canopy cover. We sampled 72 direct-seeded sites
   between 1 and 10 years old, three seedling planting sites and six
   natural regeneration sites aged 7 to 9 years old. Community structure
   attributes changed over time, with the exception of the density of
   regenerating individuals. After four years, direct-seeded sites had
   formed a multi-layered canopy and were starting to be colonized by
   non-planted species. In general, direct-seeded sites had high
   aboveground biomass, but there was high variability among sites,
   especially after age six years. Sites with higher phosphorus content had
   more tree density, basal area, and biomass compared to the others.
   Broadcast seeding sites had higher seedling and sapling densities than
   sites that received other restoration methods. In conclusion, direct
   seeding was a successful method for the initial phase of forest
   restoration, promoting a structure that was more similar to resilient
   natural regeneration sites than to non-resilient natural regeneration
   sites and seedling planting sites.},

Abstract = {The complex interactions among endangered ecosystems, landowners'
   interests, and different models of land tenure and use, constitute an
   important series of challenges for those seeking to maintain and restore
   biodiversity and augment the flow of ecosystem services. Over the past
   10 years, we have developed a data-based approach to address these
   challenges and to achieve medium and large-scale ecological restoration
   of riparian areas on private lands in the state of Sao Paulo,
   southeastern Brazil. Given varying motivations for ecological
   restoration, the location of riparian areas within landholdings,
   environmental zoning of different riparian areas, and best-practice
   restoration methods were developed for each situation. A total of 32
   ongoing projects, covering 527,982 ha, were evaluated in large sugarcane
   farms and small mixed farms, and six different restoration techniques
   have been developed to help upscale the effort. Small mixed farms had
   higher portions of land requiring protection as riparian areas (13.3\%),
   and lower forest cover of riparian areas (18.3\%), than large sugarcane
   farms (10.0\% and 36.9\%, respectively for riparian areas and forest
   cover values). In both types of farms, forest fragments required some
   degree of restoration. Historical anthropogenic degradation has
   compromised forest ecosystem structure and functioning, despite their
   high-diversity of native tree and shrub species. Notably, land use
   patterns in riparian areas differed markedly. Large sugarcane farms had
   higher portions of riparian areas occupied by highly mechanized
   agriculture, abandoned fields, and anthropogenic wet fields created by
   siltation in water courses. In contrast, in small mixed crop farms, low
   or non-mechanized agriculture and pasturelands were predominant. Despite
   these differences, plantations of native tree species covering the
   entire area was by far the main restoration method needed both by large
   sugarcane farms (76.0\%) and small mixed farms (92.4\%), in view of the
   low resilience of target sites, reduced forest cover, and high
   fragmentation, all of which limit the potential for autogenic
   restoration. We propose that plantations should be carried out with a
   high-diversity of native species in order to create biologically viable
   restored forests, and to assist long-term biodiversity persistence at
   the landscape scale. Finally, we propose strategies to integrate the
   political, socio-economic and methodological aspects needed to upscale
   restoration efforts in tropical forest regions throughout Latin America
   and elsewhere. (C) 2010 Elsevier BA/. All rights reserved.},

Journal = {FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT},

Volume = {344},

Abstract = {Pioneer tree species exhibit life-cycle characteristics and population
   structures that are mainly affected by natural or human disturbances. In
   primary forests, demographic dynamics of pioneer species may resemble
   those defined for a metapopulation. In early successional forests, the
   patterns of establishment, survival and reproduction are mainly
   determined by microclimate and biota modifications of the site after the
   human disturbance. The aim of this study was to investigate how the
   ecological processes and the population genetic factors associated with
   disturbances can affect the genetic diversity and structure of
   populations of a pioneer tree species: Croton floribundus Spreng.
   (Euphorbiaceae). Nuclear and chloroplast microsatellite markers were
   examined in plants of two size classes sampled in four gaps of primary
   forest and four sub-areas of early successional forest. Despite
   presenting similar genetic diversity levels, the genetic diversity was
   distributed differently between forests. The combined effects of seed
   dispersal and colonizations (and extinctions) were determinants of the
   fine-scale genetic structure of C. floribundus. The main finding was
   that human disturbances seem to boost the influence of founder effects
   in populations of a species with limited seed dispersal. Results
   suggested that gene flow by pollen was responsible for maintaining the
   genetic diversity within populations of C. floribundus in both forests,
   but in the early successional forest, gene flow by seeds was equally
   important. We conclude that gap dynamics, colonization, and pollen and
   seed dispersal affect the genetic diversity and structure of the pioneer
   species depending mainly on the number of colonizers, the number of
   source populations, the gene flow rates, and the level of human
   disturbance. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Journal = {BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY},

Abstract = {Interspecific interactions are considered to be important structuring
   forces in early successional vegetation. Whereas competition seems to
   prevail in less severe environments, facilitation tends to increase in
   importance in harsh environments. Hence, facilitation is expected to
   play an important role in degraded tropical areas with high irradiance,
   heat loads, and evapotranspiration, where conditions are far from
   optimum for most forest species. We planned a restoration project on the
   southeastern Brazilian coastal plain to compare growth and survival of
   tree seedlings planted at two densities (isolated or aggregated) in a
   factorial experiment with nutrient addition, We monitored survival,
   height, ground level diameter, and crown projection of 4132 saplings
   from 19 species that ranged along a successional gradient, over an
   18-month period. We used mixed-effect models to analyze the relationship
   between species performance and treatments, and Akaike's information
   criterion (AIC) to select the models, The best, model showed higher
   survival in aggregated plantations (indicating facilitation) for
   non-pioneer (slower growing) species, In contrast, we found lower
   diameter growth in aggregated plantation (indicating competition),
   Fertilizer addition did not affect survival in clusters, but,
   surprisingly, it had a negative effect on isolated plants of both
   pioneer and non-pioneer species. Fertilizer addition had a positive
   effect on diameter and crown projection growth in aggregated plantations
   (reducing competition), especially for pioneer species. Thus, whether
   facilitation or competition was the predominant interaction depended on
   the effect analyzed. As establishment of non-pioneer species in
   disturbed sites can be challenging, restoration designs could take
   advantage of higher survival rates in clusters and use resource addition
   to ameliorate growth and decrease competition for limited resources.},

Abstract = {Aim of study: We checked if an infrastructure investment project for a
   nursery to produce Eucalyptus forest seedlings using the real options
   approach was economically viable, in order to verify the influence of
   the deferral, expansion and abandonment options on the investment
   project value, as well as their concatenation.
   Area of study: Our study was based on technical-economic coefficients of
   a nursery infrastructure to be installed in the Sao Paulo's state
   Midwest region, Brazil.
   Materials and methods: The investment was assessed by addressing the
   uncertainties inherent in the investment project. We used the dynamic
   model for real option approach and, to determine the volatility of the
   project, we applied the Monte Carlo simulation method. As real options
   for the project, we employed deferral, expansion, and abandonment.
   Main results: Using the traditional valuation methodology, we obtained a
   negative static net present value of USD 50,957. When incorporating the
   real options of the abandonment, deferral and expansion in the form of
   managerial flexibility to forest managers, we obtained the expanded net
   present value of USD 216,498, that is, 524.8\% of valuation. The
   traditional method of investment evaluation undervalues the project in
   infrastructures to produce Eucalyptus forest seedlings nursery, and the
   increase in managerial flexibility, through the real options for
   deferral, expansion and abandonment, promotes value to forest managers
   and enables the feasibility of the project.
   Research highlights: Infrastructure investment project for a nursery to
   produce Eucalyptus forest seedlings is not economically viable through
   the traditional economic evaluation techniques. However, by
   incorporating managerial flexibilities, through real options, the
   investment project was valued and it became economically viable.},

Abstract = {The natural regeneration of some desirable species under exploitation
   pressure in Amazon is often very poor or non-existent. The traditional
   techniques of enrichment planting have presented low performance of the
   planted seedlings and high costs for its implementation. This study
   analyzes the first 5 years of growth and survival of five tropical tree
   species (Bertholletia excelsa, Ceiba pentandra, Torresia acreana,
   Swietenia macrophylkla and Cedrela fissilis) planted in skidding trails
   and exploitation gaps. The basic planting technique consisted in using
   the cleared areas after forest harvesting for the establishment of
   seedlings of species ecologically adapted to the gap environment. The
   study was carried out in the EMBRAPA-CPAF-ACRE (Agroforestry Research
   Centre of Acre) in Acre State in West Amazon. The diameter increment
   varied from 0.30 cm year(-1) for Bertholletia to 0.52 cm year(-1) for
   Swietenia and Torresia. After 5 years the height growth was similar for
   all species around 3.0 m. In the first year Bertholletia presented a
   high mortality, around 80\%, caused by severe predation by rodents.
   Ceiba also presented a high mortality after the second year of planting
   probably due the canopy closure. The best survival percentage was
   presented by Torresia, over 90\%. The Meliaceae (Swietenia and Cedrela)
   species had a similar survival, around 70 to 75\%. The Hypsipyla
   grandella attack was more severe in Cedrela than in Swietenia, but in
   both cases (9.37 and 31\% after 7 and 5 years respectively for Swietenia
   and Cedrela) was still low when compared with other enrichment
   plantings. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Forest plantations established in the transition region between field
   and forest can catalyze the natural regeneration of other species to
   create more favorable microsites for seed germination and seedling
   development. This study aimed at evaluating the potential of three
   homogeneous forest plantations as facilitators of natural regeneration
   of trees and shrubs species. Plantations of Peltophorum dubium (Spreng.)
   Taub. (canafistula); Handroanthus heptaphyllus (Vell.) Mattos
   (ipe-roxo); and Hovenia duicis Thunb. (uva-do-japao) were inventoried in
   24 plots randomly installed in each plantation. Individuals with height
   >= 1m were measured. The highest species density (5.2 sp 100 m(-2)) and
   the highest individuals density (10.4 ind 100 m-2) were observed in
   plantation of ``ipe-roxo{''}, where the pioneer species Varronia
   curassavica (RNR = 20, 11\%) and Baccharis sp. (16.98\%) were the most
   representative. The highest average (3.3 m) and ampleness of height (1.0
   <= height <16.0 m) were verified in plantation of ``canaffstula{''},
   where the species Piper amalago L. showed the highest value of RNR
   (18.38\%). The species itself was the most representative of its
   understory (RNR= 34.15\%) in the plantation of ``uva-do-japao{''}. This
   plantation showed the smallest amplitude in diameter (0.3 <= DBH < 11.8
   cm). These results indicate that the native species ``canafistula{''}
   and ``ipe-roxo{''} have potential to be used as facilitators of natural
   regeneration of other native species, influen-},

Abstract = {Mechanisms of natural regeneration are fundamental for ecological
   function restoration in forest fragments and degraded areas. The present
   work aimed to evaluate the seed rain and the establishment of seedlings
   of arboreal species in the Atlantic Forest, located in the northeast of
   Brazil. For sampling of the seed rain, 60 collectors were allocated
   (area of 0.196 m(2)), being equidistant, approximately, 50 m. The
   samples were collected at intervals of 30 days for a period of 12
   months. To evaluate the establishment of seedlings, sub-plots were
   allocated next to the collectors, totaling 60 subplots of 0.25 m(2)
   each. The arboreal individuals identified by the diaspores collected in
   the seed rain and by the seedlings established in the fragment were
   counted and classified for the dispersion syndrome and successional
   group. The seed rain was represented by 60 morphospecies and 20
   botanical families. The ecological group and the predominant dispersion
   syndrome were of early secondary and zoocoric species, respectively. In
   relation to the established seedlings, 122 seedlings were counted, being
   Tapirira guianensis L. with higher number of seedlings. The rainfall of
   seeds presents potential for the maintenance of the forest dynamics due
   to the high species richness that compose the current vegetation. Being
   predominantly composed of species that produce abundant fruits with
   zoocoric dispersion that serve as food for fauna. While few seeds
   germinate to form the seedling bank, most of them are contributing to
   seed bank formation.},

Abstract = {Phytosociological surveys and soil quality studies are relevant tools
   for the implementation of restoration programmes. This study aimed to
   characterise the vegetation of the tree and sapling strata in preserved
   riparian forests of the middle portion of the Rio Doce watershed in the
   Atlantic Rain Forest, Brazil. In addition, we tested the association
   between edaphic factors and the vegetation community. We sampled three
   sites of the middle sector of the Rio Doce watershed in Itueta (two
   sites) and Santa Rita do Itueto (one site) municipalities in Minas
   Gerais, south-eastern Brazil. At each sampling site, we inventoried 15
   plots of 100 m(2) (10 x 10 m) for the tree stratum. Within each plot of
   the tree stratum we delimited a 25 m(2) (5 x 5 m) plot, totalling 4 500
   m(2) and 1 125 m(2) respectively for the tree and sapling strata. We
   employed co-inertia analysis to test the relationship between soil
   factors and the plant community and to highlight the taxon- environment
   relationship. We recorded 157 species belonging to 31 families, with 105
   species from 24 families in the tree stratum, and 85 species from 22
   families in the sapling stratum. Edaphic factors were highly
   heterogeneous among plots, although most of the plots presented soils
   with neutral pH and high fertility (base saturation > 50\%). Co-inertia
   analyses showed highly significant associations between edaphic factors
   and the plant community, both for the tree (RV = 0.486, p < 0.001) and
   the sapling strata (RV = 0.692, p < 0.001). We highlighted the existence
   of a clear edaphic- floristic gradient, with a significant association
   of certain species with contrasting soil conditions. Knowledge about the
   association between environmental characteristics and floristic
   composition can assist in the selection of species with greater chances
   to establish in specific environmental conditions.},

Abstract = {Twelve native woody species were studied to investigate the influence of

   mycorrhizal (AM) fungi during seedling establishment and growth.
   Seedlings were grown in soils of low and high natural fertility.
   uninoculated or inoculated with AM fungi, under greenhouse conditions.
   The mycorrhizal root colonization and plant responsiveness were higher
   among early successional species than late successional ones. Among
   early successional species. in both soils, mycorrhizal colonization
   provided significant increase in total dry mass. growth rates of shoot
   and root, root length, density of root tissues, root surface area and P
   concentration and content in the shoot. Early successional species grown
   with AM fungi displayed significant decreases in carbon allocation to
   roots, specific root length and the length and incidence of root hairs.
   Mycorrhizal colonization did not affect the root morphology of the late
   successional species in either soil. The growth of these woody Species
   was influenced by differences in soil fertility. There was positive
   correlation between the degree of plant responses to AM inoculation with
   the percentage of root colonized by AM fungi. In both soils, plant
   responsiveness and mycorrhizal root colonization correlated positively
   to root-hair incidence and root-hair length and correlated negatively to
   fine-root diameter. The results Suggest that during the establishment of
   seedlings, the large responses to the inoculation and colonization of
   roots by AM fungi are related to both the successional status and root
   morphological plasticity of the host plant, regardless of soil

Abstract = {Leaf traits are good indicators of ecosystem functioning and can affect
   herbivory and leaf reflectance patterns, allowing a better understanding
   of changes in environmental conditions, such those observed during
   forest natural regeneration. The aim of this study was to evaluate the
   intraspecific variation in leaf traits and their influence on the
   pattern of herbivory and leaf reflectance in three species distributed
   along a successional gradient (early, intermediate and late stages) in a
   tropical dry forest (TDF) in northern Minas Gerais, Brazil. We sampled
   individuals of the following abundant tree species that occurred in
   multiple successional stages: Cenostigma pluviosum, Handroanthus
   ochraceus, and Tabebuia reticulata. We collected 10 leaves from each
   tree to determine the contents of chlorophyll a, b, and total,
   carotenoids and water, as well as the percentage of leaf area removed by
   herbivores and leaf specific mass (LSM). We also measured five spectral
   reflectance indices (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index-NDVI, Simple
   Ratio-SR, modified Normalized Difference-nND, modified SR-mSR and Water
   Index-WI) using a portable spectrometer. Our results showed
   intraspecific differences in most leaf traits along the successional
   gradient, suggesting that local adaptation may play an important role in
   plant community assembly. However, herbivory only differed for H.
   ochraceus in early and intermediate stages, but it was not affected by
   the leaf traits considered here. Spectral reflectance indices also
   differed among successional stage for all species together and for each
   species separately, except for T. reticulata in intermediate and late
   stages. Thus, leaf spectral signatures may be an important tool to the
   remote detection of different successional stages in TDFs, with
   implications for forest management.},

   to investigate the effects of distance to seed sources and amount of
   remaining nearby Atlantic Forest habitat. The abundance and species
   richness of regenerating plants were explained by multiple regressions
   performed using plantation age and species richness, distance to the
   nearest patch, and surrounding habitat. Distance to the nearest forest
   remnant, through both the matrix in a straight line and riparian
   vegetation, was the best predictor of species richness and abundance of
   regenerating plants. Riparian corridors doubled the distance at which
   forest remnants influenced restoration sites. However, the area of
   forest remnants in the site neighborhood did not influence regeneration
   diversity, suggesting that the quality of both the seed source
   (including the status of seed dispersing fauna) and reforestation
   environment for the establishment of forest species should be
   investigated.},

Title = {Role of nurse plants in Araucaria Forest expansion over grassland in
   south Brazil},
Journal = {AUSTRAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {31},

Abstract = {Araucaria Forest expansion over grassland takes place under wet climate
   conditions and low disturbance and it is hypothesized that isolated
   trees established on grassland facilitate the establishment of forest
   woody species beneath their canopies. Forest with Araucaria angustifolia
   is a particular type of Brazilian Atlantic Forest and the main forest
   type on the highland plateau in south Brazil, often forming mosaics with
   natural Campos grassland. The objectives of this paper were to evaluate
   the role of isolated shrubs and trees as colonization sites for
   seedlings of Araucaria Forest woody species on grassland, to determine
   which species function as preferential nurse plants in the process and
   the importance of vertebrate diaspore dispersal on the structure of
   seedling communities beneath nurse plants. The study was conducted in
   Sao Francisco de Paula, Rio Grande do Sul State, where we sampled
   isolated shrubs and trees in natural grassland near Araucaria Forest
   edges. Seedlings were counted and identified, and seedling diaspore
   dispersal syndromes, size and colour were registered. We detected 11
   woody species with a potential role in nucleating grassland colonization
   by forest species. Beneath the canopies of nurse plants more forest
   species seedlings were found compared with open field grassland and the
   seedlings had diaspores mostly dispersed by vertebrates. Also, more
   seedlings were found under the canopy of A. angustifolia than beneath
   other nurse plant species. We conclude that A. angustifolia trees
   established on grassland act as nurse plants, by attracting disperser
   birds that promote colonization of the site by other forest species
   seedlings, and that under low level of grassland disturbance,
   conservation of frugivorous vertebrate assemblages may increase forest
   expansion over natural grassland and also facilitate the regeneration of
   degraded forest areas.},

Abstract = {This work aimed to evaluate the floristic composition of the remaining
   riparian forest of a stream called `Sanga Lagoao do Ouro', seeking to
   obtain information about its degradation, analyzing the distribution of
   the species in the different floristic strata, the natural regeneration

   forest of `Sanga Lagoao do Ouro', which is tributary of the third order
   of `Vacacai-mirim' River. Its spring is located in an urban area,
   covering several villages, the campus of Federal University of Santa
   Maria as well as an extensive rural area. The predominant soils are
   classified as: Bruno-Grayish (Bruno-Acinzentados), Red-Yellow
   (Vermelho-Amarelos) and Red (Vermelhos) Alfisols (Argissolos) and Udalf
   soil (Planossolos Haplicos), which are of low natural fertility and
   quite susceptible to water erosion. The floristic surveying was
   accomplished in 12 sampling plots of 300 m(2) each, demarcated along the
   margin of the stream where the strata were evaluated: seedlings, natural
   regeneration and arboreal. The floristic survey shows degradation of the
   studied riparian forest, which is evidenced by the low number of native
   species, the poor distribution of the species in the different strata
   and the great presence of exotic species. The species that present the
   highest frequency and which appear in the three floristic strata
   mentioned in this study have greater for natural regeneration, such as:
   Eugenia uniflora, Allophylus edulis, Psidium guajava, Cestrum
   strigilatum, Prunus myrtifolia, Zanthoxylum rhoifolium, Casearia

   Brazil. The vegetation survey was performed in four sampled fragments in
   57 plots. In the plots, the identification of the individuals and
   measurement of circumference at breast height (CAP) was carried out,
   according to the following classes of size: Class I) arboreal strata,
   individuals with CAP >= 30 cm (10 x 20 m); Class II) arboreal strata,
   individuals with 15 <= CAP < 30 cm (10 x 10 m); Class III) established
   natural regeneration, individuals with 3 <= CAP < 15 cm (5 x 5 m) and
   Class IV) bank of seedlings, individuals with height >= 30 cm and CAP <
   3 cm (2 x 2 m). The data of Class I constituted a matrix parcel x
   species, which was used in a multivariate analysis, allowing the
   classification of groups of plots that characterize microhabitats. The
   forest fragments presented low floristic richness of typical species of
   Mixed Ombrophilous Forest. From this environment highlight two main
   groups, one characteristic of riparian forest and the other from capoes.
   In the riparian forests (GR1), highlighted Eugenia uruguayensis and
   Gymnanthes klotzschiana. In capoes (GR2), the predominant species were
   Araucaria angustifolia, Podocarpus lambertii and Myrceugenia cucullata.
   The condition of species in different classes associated with their
   ecological characteristics allows identifying possible strategies for
   perpetuation of the arboreal-shrubby component of population and

Abstract = {This study was developed in the Mata do Para so Reserve from the Vicosa
   Federal University. Ten natural gaps of different sizes were selected.
   Digital hemispherical photographs were obtained from the middle of the
   gaps, in a 5 m understorey area (surroundings) and neighboring areas.
   These hemispherical photographs allowed calculating areas corresponding
   to gaps and their respective canopy openness and surroundings. Inside
   the gaps and surroundings, all individuals with height >= 1.00 m and
   diameter in height of 1.30 m from the soil (DAP) below 5.00 m were
   sampled. The predominance of small gaps with areas below 100 m2 and with
   small canopy openness was verified, as well as the predominance of the
   same shade-tolerant species typical of the final succession stadiums,
   which are abundant in the understorey around these gaps. In the set of
   gaps, 759 individuals were sampled and distributed into 69 species
   belonging to 28 botanical families. The Shannon diversity index (H') of
   gaps ranged from 1.026 to 3.011. Coffea arabica and Picramnia regnelli
   were the most abundant species both in the set of gaps and in the set of
   surroundings (understorey). The floristic similarity between both sets
   was high (Ij = 69\%), indicating that the same species that regenerate
   in the sub-wood also regenerate in the gaps environment. At long term,
   the ecological dominance of Coffea arabica in both environments may
   impair the conservation of autoctone species in this part of the forest.},

Abstract = {This study objective was to evaluate the effective revegetation in a
   Mogi Guagu River degraded floodplain area, located at Luiz Antonio
   municipality (21 degrees 31'S e 47 degrees 55'W), Sao Paulo State,
   Brazil. Two native riparian forest remnants (RIP1 and RIP2) and three
   10-year-old reforested areas, planted of native species (R1, R2 and R3),
   were analyzed by using phytosociological describers of the arboreal
   stratum (trees with DBH >= 5 cm) as indicators. The arboreal stratum
   inventory was accomplished by 180 plots (10 x 10 m each), 60
   representing every native forest and 20 for every reforested area. A
   total of 60 arboreal species was recorded, only six species (Cecropia
   hololeuca, Croton urucurana, Genipa americana, Inga striata, Nectandra
   megapotamica e Peltophorum dubium) occurring in all the five studied
   areas. Seventeen species were common to both native forests, and nine
   species were recorded in all the reforested areas. Sebastiania
   commersoniana and Guarea macrophylla were recorded in the native forests
   (RIP1 and RIP2), and Cecropia hololeuca, Croton urucurana and Inga
   striata occurring in all the reforested areas, were the species that
   best characterize the physiognomy of local diversity and were the most
   important among the studied species. The results showed that the
   rehabilitation of the areas made by the reforestation created conditions
   to implant forests with similar structures of the adjacent natural
   remainders. The reforestation with native species performed in the
   degraded floodplain of Mogi Guagu River, initially with the
   predomination of invasive grasses, has been effective at the first stage
   of the ecological restoration process. The reforestation is making
   possible the natural regeneration of species from the adjacent remnants,
   what indicates that the similarity between planted forests and the
   native ones are rising through the time. The phytosociology,
   accomplished ten years after the planting date, is adequate to evaluate
   the effectiveness of the reforestation during the restoration process of
   degradated areas in the Mogi Guagu floodplain.},

Abstract = {The Amazon Rainforest plays major roles in global carbon and nitrogen
   cycling. Despite this region's immense importance, deforestation and
   pasture creation are still occurring at alarming rates. In this study,
   we investigated the effects of land-use change on aerobic
   ammonia-oxidizers in primary rainforest, young and old pasture, and
   secondary forest in Rondonia, Brazil. Forest-to-pasture conversion
   decreased soil nitrate, phosphorus, and exchangeable acidity contents
   that recovered to pre-disturbance levels as pastures aged or were
   abandoned and formed secondary forest. The ammonia-oxidizing community,
   numerically dominated by thaumarchaea, shifted due to land-use change,
   both in terms of gene abundance and community structure. However,
   thaumarchaeal ammonia monooxygenase gene abundances did not correlate
   with any measured soil physicochemial parameters. Phylogenetic analyses
   showed that community structural changes in ammonia-oxidizing
   thaumarchaea are driven by a shift away from primary rainforest, old
   pasture, and secondary forest clusters to separate clusters for young
   pasture. Additionally, the nearly complete disappearance in young
   pasture, old pasture, and secondary forest sites of a thaumarchaeal
   genus, the Nitrosotalea, indicates that land-use change can have long
   lasting effects on large portions of the thaumarchaeal community. The
   results of this study can be used as a conceptual foundation for
   determining how ammonia-oxidizers become altered by land-use change in
   South American tropical forests. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {Abandonment of agricultural lands promotes the global expansion of
   secondary forests, which are critical for preserving biodiversity and
   ecosystem functions and services. Such roles largely depend, however, on
   two essential successional attributes, trajectory and recovery rate,
   which are expected to depend on landscape-scale forest cover in
   nonlinear ways. Using a multi-scale approach and a large vegetation
   dataset (843 plots, 3511 tree species) from 22 secondary forest
   chronosequences distributed across the Neotropics, we show that
   successional trajectories of woody plant species richness, stem density
   and basal area are less predictable in landscapes (4 km radius) with
   intermediate (40-60\%) forest cover than in landscapes with high
   (greater than 60\%) forest cover. This supports theory suggesting that
   high spatial and environmental heterogeneity in intermediately
   deforested landscapes can increase the variation of key ecological
   factors for forest recovery (e.g. seed dispersal and seedling
   recruitment), increasing the uncertainty of successional trajectories.
   Regarding the recovery rate, only species richness is positively related
   to forest cover in relatively small (1 km radius) landscapes. These
   findings highlight the importance of using a spatially explicit
   landscape approach in restoration initiatives and suggest that these
   initiatives can be more effective in more forested landscapes,
   especially if implemented across spatial extents of 1-4 km radius.},

Abstract = {This study describes forest succession following slash-and-burn
   agriculture in central Amazonia, based on four chronosequences (22
   sites) of 2- to 25-y-old secondary regrowth and mature forest. Biomass
   accumulated in the form of a saturation curve: 25 y of regrowth restored
   half of the mature-forest biomass, 75\%,) would be restored after an
   estimated 175 y. Biomass accumulation was accompanied by a rapid
   decrease in woody plant density and an increase of the positive skew of
   plant size distribution. Liana biomass share declined from 5.0\% in
   young to 1.9\% in old regrowth, and 1.3\%) in mature forest, whereas the
   share of palms was low (0.5\%) in young regrowth and high in old
   regrowth (1.8\%) and mature forest (2.2\%). 25-y-old regrowth was
   similar with mature forest in respect to woody plant density and
   growthform composition, but both the plant size distribution and the
   number of stems per plant differed strongly from mature forest. A
   moderate increase in land use had only minor effects on biomass
   accumulation, but profoundly changed structural characteristics of
   regrowth, pointing to a high vulnerability to degradation. Thus, the
   sustainability of slash-and-burn in central Amazonia may be lower than
   the rapid initial biomass accumulation would make it seem.},

   processes of natural regeneration in function of the reservoir distance
   and along the planted area. At 150 months, in the arboreal species
   inventory, all the planted and the natural regenerations with diameter
   at breast height >= 5 cm were measured. Grades (1.0 to 5.0) were
   attributed for the evaluation of the tree vigor. For the natural
   regeneration survey, four transects were demarcated and three 1 x 15 m
   plots were established in each transect, following the slope. Results
   Showed that some of the pioneer species displayed senescence signs after
   13 years of planting. In the natural regeneration, 55 species of 27
   families were identified. Species of the Asteraceae family predominated
   in the more disturbed areas, because they are adapted to these
   conditions. There was predominance in zoochoric dispersion among the
   regenerating species. The greater regeneration density was found near
   the reservoir, whereas the bigger diversity and average height were

Title = {Searching for putative avian malaria vectors in a Seasonally Dry
   Tropical Forest in Brazil},
Journal = {PARASITES \& VECTORS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {9},
Month = {NOV 16},
Abstract = {Background: Haemosporidian parasites of the genera Plasmodium and
   Haemoproteus can have detrimental effects on individual birds and
   populations. Despite recent investigations into the distribution and
   richness of these parasites and their vertebrate hosts, little is known
   about their dipteran vectors. The Neotropics has the highest diversity
   of mosquitoes in the world, but few studies have tried to identify
   vectors in this area, hampering the understanding of the ecology of
   avian malaria in the highly diverse Neotropical environments. Methods:
   Shannon traps and active collection were used to capture 27,110
   mosquitoes in a Seasonally Dry Tropical Forest in southeastern Brazil, a
   highly endangered ecosystem.
   Results: We screened 17,619 mosquito abdomens from 12 different species
   and several unidentified specimens of Culex, grouped into 1,913 pools,
   for the presence of haemosporidians. Two pools (out of 459) of the
   mosquito Mansonia titillans and one pool (out of 29) of Mansonia
   pseudotitillans were positive for Plasmodium parasites, with the
   detection of a new parasite lineage in the former species. Detected
   Plasmodium lineages were distributed in three different clades within
   the phylogenetic tree revealing that Mansonia mosquitoes are potential
   vectors of genetically distant parasites. Two pools of Culex spp. (out
   of 43) were positive for Plasmodium gallinaceum and closely related
   lineages. We found a higher abundance of these putative vectors in
   pasture areas, but they were also distributed in areas at intermediate
   and late successional stages. One pool of the mosquito Psorophora
   discrucians (out of 173) was positive for Haemoproteus.
   Conclusions: The occurrence of different Plasmodium lineages in Mansonia
   mosquitoes indicates that this genus encompasses potential vectors of
   avian malaria parasites in Brazil, even though we did not find positive
   thoraces among the samples tested. Additional evidence is required to
   assign the role of Mansonia mosquitoes in avian malaria transmission and
   further studies will add information about evolutionary and ecological
   aspects of avian haemosporidia and untangle the diversity of their
   vectors in Brazil.},

Title = {EFFECT OF THE REMOVAL OF REGENERATING INDIVIDUALS ON THE SEEDLING BANK
   DYNAMICS IN PLANT COMMUNITIES},
Journal = {REVISTA ARVORE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {47},
Abstract = {The use of forest seedling banks is recommended for producing seedlings
   of species essential for specific forest typologies for which
   propagation poses challenges. However, given the lack of understanding
   of how human intervention, such as the removal of regenerating
   individuals from the forest, influences the composition and structure of
   the plant community, there is a pressing need for further research. Our
   primary objective here was to identify the effects of seedling removal
   on natural regeneration in forest communities and to characterize
   seedling bank dynamics three years after anthropogenic intervention. A
   randomized block design was used for the experiment, consisting of five
   removal intensities (0, 25, 50, 75, and 100\% removal), with evaluations
   conducted every three months for three years. All individuals of the
   shrub-arboreal component between 5-55 cm heights were measured.
   Collected data were analyzed to determine the impacts of the removal of
   individuals and the influence of environmental elements on the seedling
   community. We found that the shrub-arboreal component of the forest
   community exhibited marked resilience three years following the removal
   of regenerating individuals. Removal of up to 50\% of regenerating
   individuals does not appear to interfere with plant community dynamics,
   suggesting species with a high density of individuals in the seedling
   bank are resilient to the impacts of human intervention. Although
   climatic seasonality also affects seedling bank dynamics in plant
   communities, this effect depends on the level of human intervention in
   an area and, therefore, has been omitted from the analysis.},

Abstract = {Context. The Caatinga biome, located in the Brazilian semiarid region,
   has few remnants of riparian forest. Thus, it is essential to know the
   effectiveness of strategies aimed at forest recovery. Aims. The
   objective of this study was to investigate the use of the epigeal fauna
   as a bioindicator tool of soil quality and ecosystem sustainability to
   determine the best native forest restoration strategy in the Caatinga in
   Belem do Sao Francisco, Pernambuco, Brazil. Methods. In areas previously
   dominated by Prosopis juliflora (Sw.) DC., three treatments were
   installed: conventional planting of native species (P), planting of
   native species in islands (applied nucleation, N), and natural
   regeneration (NR). These restoration treatments were compared with an
   area of high P. juliflora dominance (PJ). Epigeal fauna were captured in
   two periods of the year (wet and dry seasons) using pitfall traps in a
   completely randomised design. We estimated the total abundance,
   richness, diversity, and evenness, as well as the trophic guilds of the
   epigeal fauna. Key results. The epigeal fauna organisms were distributed
   in 22 taxonomic groups. The Saprophagous Diplopoda group was exclusive
   to PJ. The Predator Pseudocorpionida group was not observed in the NR
   area in any period. Cluster analysis revealed more dissimilarity of the
   NR with the other areas. Conclusions. In the short term (less than 2
   years), P increased the diversity and richness of the epigeal fauna and
   promoted better structuring of the Microphagous/ Saprophagous
   (Entomobryomorpha, Poduromorpha, and Symphypleona) trophic guild, while
   NR promoted better structuring of the Herbivorous (Auchenorryhncha and
   Heteroptera) and Saprophagous/Predator (Formicidae and Coleoptera)
   trophic guilds.},

Abstract = {The biodiversity value of human-modified landscapes has become a central
   question in the tropical forest conservation biology, yet the degree to
   which plant populations and communities are restructured in response to
   environmental change remains unclear. Here, we address tree species
   density in a fragmented Atlantic forest landscape to test the hypothesis
   that tree assemblages inhabiting edge-dominated forest habitats approach
   typical conditions of early successional systems. Seedlings and adults
   from 141 tree species were sampled across 39 0.1-ha plots: 19 in small
   fragments (<100 ha) and 20 in mature forest stands within the interior
   of the largest forest remnant of the study landscape (3500 ha). A total
   of 5448 seedlings and adults were recorded, with >55 \% of all tree
   species exhibiting higher densities in small fragments than in mature
   forest, particularly pioneers (>60 \% of all species). Seedlings and
   adults of these proliferating species differed from species exhibiting
   population declines in terms of wood density and seed size,
   respectively. Additionally, pioneers were more abundant than
   shade-tolerant species, as were hardwood species in the case of
   seedlings. Tree species showing highest population increases consisted
   largely of long-lived, light-demanding canopy species bearing soft or
   hardwood and small-to-medium-sized seeds. Tree assemblage structure also
   differed in terms of forest habitats with small forest fragments
   supporting few rare species, whereas the most rapidly proliferating
   species were much more widespread and abundant in fragments. However, 60
   \% of all adult pioneer species recorded in small fragments were not
   recorded as seedlings in this habitat type, although both seedling and
   adult assemblages were dominated by pioneer species. Edge-dominated tree
   assemblages are likely to experience long-term shifts toward greater
   dominance of long-lived, pioneer canopy species.},

Title = {TEMPORAL AND SPATIAL VARIABILITY OF THE DIAMETER DISTRIBUTION IN A
   SECONDARY BRAZILIAN ATLANTIC FOREST SUGGESTS SITE-SPECIFIC MANAGEMENT
   PRACTICES},
Journal = {REVISTA ARVORE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {44},
Abstract = {The diameter distribution of a forest makes it possible to understand
   its ecological processes and to define actions related to forest
   management aiming at forest conservation, biodiversity increase,
   production, and carbon sequestration, among others. This study aimed to
   identify variation in the diameter distribution in a secondary Atlantic
   Forest, as a function of sites, over 24 years. The diameter at 1.3 m in
   height (dbh) was measured for each tree over 5.0 cm dbh, in ten sites,
   from 1992 to 2016. It was analyzed the quadratic mean diameter (Dq), the
   Dq annual periodic increment (API(Dq)), the Liocourt's Quotient (q), and
   the diameter distribution with Meyer's exponential model. The average
   API(Dq )over 24 years was 0.03 cm year(-1), an average increase of
   0.21\%, with site variation ranging from 0.74\% to -0.45\%. The diameter
   distribution of the forest as a whole maintained the reverse J-shaped
   over 24-years. When the sites in each inventory year were analyzed, the
   variation in the diameter distribution was evident, and there were
   differences in the recovery capacity of the reverse J-shaped
   distribution from 1992 to 2016. The overall results indicate that,
   whenever possible, the management plan to recover the structure of the
   Atlantic Forest remnants should be site-specific, particularly in the

Abstract = {Accurate mapping of secondary forest and the age of these forests is
   critical to assess the carbon budget in tropical regions accurately.
   Using SPOT HRV (High Resolution Visible) data, techniques were developed
   and tested to discriminate primary forest, secondary forest and
   deforested areas on a study site in Rondonia, Brazil. Six co-registered
   SPOT HRV images (1986, 1988, 1989, 1991, 1992 and 1994) were used to
   create a time series of classified images of land cover (primary forest,
   secondary forest and deforested). These trajectories were used to
   identify secondary forest age classes relative to the most recent (1994)
   image. The resultant 1994 map of primary forest, secondary forest age
   classes and deforested areas served as ground reference data to
   establish training and testing sites. Several band 2 and 3 texture
   measurements were calculated using a 3 x 3 window to quantify canopy
   homogeneity. Neural networks and linear analysis techniques were tested
   for discriminating between primary forest, secondary forest and
   deforested pixels. The techniques were also employed to extract
   secondary forest age.
   A neural network using band 3 and a texture measure of band 2 and 3 from
   a single image (1994) discriminated primary forest, secondary forest (1
   to >9 years) and deforested pixel with an average accuracy of 95\%. The
   use of texture information increased the secondary forest discrimination
   accuracy 6.4\% (from 83.5 to 89.9\%). Spectral and textural information
   were also used to predict secondary forest age as a continuous variable.
   The neural network with the highest accuracy produced a RMSE (predicted
   network age versus actual secondary forest age) of 2.0 years with a
   coefficient of determination (predicted versus true) of 0.38. These
   results were significantly improved by using multitemporal information.
   The spectral and textural information from two images (1994 and 1989)
   were used to extract secondary forest information. The neural network
   results showed that 95.5\% of the secondary forest pixels were correctly
   classified as secondary forest pixels (as opposed to 89.9\% of the
   pixels using only the 1994 image). The RMSE and R-2 accuracies in
   extracting secondary forest age as a continuous variable were 1.3 and
   0.75, respectively.},

Abstract = {Land-use practices can dramatically shift the trajectories of rain
   forest recovery. In a 25-year study, Amazon rain forest regenerated
   following deforestation as long as seed availability and seedling
   recruitment were not interrupted. In contrast, rain forest converted to
   cattle pastures via cutting and burning prior to abandonment diverted
   succession, leading to highly simplified stands dominated by a single
   genus. Annual fires eliminated seedlings, saplings, coppice, and seeds
   in the soil, except for several Vismia species. Once established, Vismia
   regenerated by continual resprouting and resisted the establishment of
   other rain forest species, especially the normal suite of pioneers.
   Through time, succession both in abandoned clearcuts and pastures
   increased in stem density and biomass; however, species accumulation and
   ecosystem services were limited in pastures when compared with those in
   abandoned clearcuts. Therefore, prescribed burning to maintain
   pastureland leaves a legacy that is not readily extinguished, whereas
   abandoning clearcuts engenders an accelerated rain forest regeneration.},

Abstract = {Restoration projects may have broad and complex ecological goals that
   require distinct and integrative measures for evaluating restoration
   development and success. However, most studies usually evaluate
   structural and species composition parameters, with less emphasis on
   ecological processes and functioning. The main objective of this study
   is to use an integrated approach that considers structural and floristic
   parameters as well as ecological processes and functional traits to
   evaluate and identify the parameters that most differentiate forests
   undergoing restoration and their reference sites. Additionally, we
   tested if the recovery of ecosystem functionality happens at the same
   rate as the recovery of vegetation structure. We performed the study in
   three 10-year-old restoration and three adjacent reference areas located
   in the south of Brazil (subtropical forest). We sampled a total of 15
   plots (100 m(2) in size) per treatment, per site and collected data of
   trees, natural regeneration, litter stock, decomposition, detritivory,
   and litter and soil C:N ratio. We also used a multifunctionality index
   to account for the broad functionality of the ecosystem. Results showed
   that forests undergoing restoration had lower values of vegetation
   structure and multifunctionality, indicating that restoration sites have
   not yet achieved values similar to the reference ecosystem. Values for
   species richness and functional diversity, however, were higher in
   restoration sites. Moreover, even though values were lower for
   multifunctionality, differences toward reference sites were less
   pronounced than we expected when compared to values of vegetation
   structure, showing that ecological processes may recover even before the
   full recovery of aboveground vegetation.},

Year = {2018},
Volume = {25},
Number = {4},
Abstract = {This study aimed to analyse the tree community of an urban forest with
   40 years of natural regeneration after abandonment of the degraded land.
   We hypothesized that after four decades of forest succession, the
   diversity, structure and functional aspects of the community would be
   similar to other secondary surrounding forests. We established ten plots
   (20x 20m), where all trees with DBH >= 5 cm were sampled. The inventory
   included 605 trees (1513 ind.ha(-1)) distributed across 25 species. The
   diversity index (H' = 0.92) and basal area (10.43 m(2).ha(-1)) were
   lower than in surrounding forests. The results showed a great dominance
   of Eremanthus erythropappus with consequent delay in successional
   advance, and low potential of attraction of fauna, which suggests the
   need for management to control its population. Understanding the
   functioning of novel urban forests and discussing these neglected
   ecosystems is fundamental to guide management actions for both human and
   ecosystem prosperity.},

Abstract = {Previous studies have demonstrated that the tree community of small and
   isolated forest fragments show persisting structural and functional
   attributes characteristic of early-successional systems. Yet, the
   impacts of forest small size and isolation on several tree community
   attributes have not been comprehensively quantified in long-term
   studies. Here we analysed permanent plots over 17 years to investigate
   the recovery of community attributes in a small tropical forest remnant
   surrounded by human-modified landscapes in the endangered Brazilian
   Atlantic Forest. We conducted analyses on community species richness,
   functional diversity and composition, and aboveground biomass for the
   overall, adult and juvenile communities. The analysis of the demographic
   rates indicates a self-thinning phase (reduction in stem density and
   increase in basal area) characteristic of late-succession stages. In
   general, we found a reduction in the proportion of simple leaves along
   with a gradual increase in wood density mostly for the adult tree
   community and a significant increase in aboveground biomass throughout
   the years. Despite its reduced size, the fragment studied does not show
   clear trends of altered forest structure and functional composition
   dynamics through time. Yet, it holds aboveground biomass values
   comparable to large undisturbed rainforests, thus indicating that the
   ecological value of small forest fragments should not be neglected.},

Abstract = {This work evaluated the potential of natural regeneration in the
   restoration a disturbed water spring surrouding, after stopping the
   impacts, on forest and wasted grazing land. It was analyzed the
   structure of the stratum and natural regeneration under canopy and in
   open area surrounding a water spring under process of recovery, located
   in Nazareno, Minas Gerais. The tree stratum was assessed in 4 permanent
   plots (10 x 50 m), sampling, identifying and measuring height of trees
   with DBH >= 5 cm diameter. For assessing the natural regeneration, 16
   plots (10 x 2 m) were set. Trees with height> 10 cm and DBH <5 cm were
   identified and measured. The samples were established at 7 and 51 months
   after the isolation of the area. Phytosociological parameters of the
   tree and regenerative strata were calculated for each species,
   classifying them by the type of dispersal and ecological group. Shannon
   diversity index and evenness were calculated for each community which
   were also compared by Sorensen index. The results showed that the areas
   are dissimilar; with most species found at the regeneration under
   canopy, showing a intake in the system. The communities had a high
   proportion of zoochoric species and pattern of higher light demanding
   climax species and a decrease in the proportion of pioneer species front
   one inventory to another, indicating progress in natural succession. The
   density of the individuals regenerating under canopy was much greater,
   probably due to the dominance of Brachiaria in the open area, showing
   that use of the regeneration as a unique method of recovery should not

Abstract = {The industrialization of the Paraiba Valley, Brazil has been driven

   the municipalities share similar topographic characteristics with a
   predominance of hilly terrains. The depletion of the soils' productive
   capacity after numerous land use cycles without adequate management
   practices was a common cause of land use abandonment. This research
   analyzes land use/cover data, environmental policies, census-based data,
   and interviews with stakeholders, to understand the factors that account
   for a forest transition in the Paraiba Valley where gains in forest
   cover more than offset any remaining deforestation. Local conditions,
   such as topography, land use history, environmental policies, engagement
   of society in complying with legal regulations, commodity markets, and
   the action of enforcement agencies, represent dimensions which,

Abstract = {This research's goal was validate the individual tree model developed
   for a Seasonal Semideciduous Forest in middle succession stage. A
   simulation was executed aiming to integrate the mortality, growth and
   ingrowths sub-models, which are part of the individual tree level
   complete model for natural forests. A neural artificial network (RNA)
   was selected to integrate the mortality sub-model, which helped to
   predict mortality probability for each specimen between measuring
   periods. Another RNA was selected to project the dbh, total height and
   bole height, simultaneously, in a future measuring year. As for the
   ingrowths sub-model, an average tax of trees' ingrowths was determined
   between each measuring period. For the model validation was used data
   from plots between 1994 and 2008; these plots were independent of the
   ones used to generate the sub-models. Since the measuring in 1994,
   simulations of mortality, growth and ingrowths were done in 1997, 2000,
   2004 e 2008. The results were compared to the observed values in the
   final projection year (2008). The complete individual tree model was
   efficient in simulating growth and forest production in all details

Journal = {SCIENCE OF NATURE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {106},

Abstract = {Canopy ecology is a fast-growing field, but still a scientific frontier
   in many ecological aspects. For instance, the hypothesis that tree
   traits shape patterns in ant-plant interactions lacks data, notably for
   tropical canopies in different successional stages. In this study, we
   investigated canopy traits, such as tree height, the presence of
   extrafloral nectaries (EFNs), connectivity among tree crowns, and
   successional stage, structure ant-tree interactions in a tropical dry
   forest (TDF), examining whether these are the determinant factors for
   ant species richness. We collected ants on trees in early and late
   successional stages over 2 years, in rainy and dry seasons. In the late
   successional stage, ant species richness was greater in the taller
   trees; in the early successional stage, the smallest trees had a greater
   ant species richness than the taller trees. The EFNs and connectivity
   among treetops had no effect on ant species richness. We obtained a
   tree-ant network of the early successional stage, involving 786
   interactions among 57 ant species and 75 trees; in the late successional
   stage, the network had 914 interactions among 60 ant species and 75
   trees. There were 27 species of trees in our study, 11 of which (40.7\%
   of all individual trees) had EFNs. The ant-plant interactions were not
   randomly distributed, suggesting that various biotic factors structured
   the ant assemblies. This study presents new insights into ant-tree
   interactions, showing that both tree height and successional stage
   influence the occurrence of many species of ants in tree canopies of
   tropical dry forests.},

Abstract = {Fine root morphological traits and distribution, arbuscular mycorrhizal
   (AM) fungi, soil fertility, and nutrient concentration in fine root
   tissue were compared in sites under different successional phases: grass
   plants, secondary forest, and mature forest in Londrina county, Parana
   state, southern Brazil. Soil cores were collected randomly at the 0-10-
   and 10-20-cm depths in three quadrants (50 m(2)) in each site. Plants
   from the different successional stages displayed high differences in
   fine root distribution, fine root traits, and mycorrhizal root
   colonization. There were increases in the concentration of nutrients
   both in soil and fine roots and decrease of bulk soil density along the
   succession. The fine root biomass and diameter increased with the
   succession progress. The total fine root length, specific root length,
   root hair length, and root hair incidence decreased with the succession
   advance. Similarly, the mycorrhizal root colonization and the density of
   AM fungi spores in the soil decreased along the succession. Mycorrhizal
   root colonization and spore density were positively correlated with fine
   root length, specific root length, root hair length, root hair
   incidence, and bulk density and negatively correlated with fine root
   diameter and concentration of some nutrients both in soil and root
   tissues. Nutrient concentration in root tissue and in soil was
   positively correlated with fine root diameter and negatively correlated
   with specific root length, root hair length, and root hair incidence.
   These results suggest different adaptation strategies of plant roots for
   soil exploration and mineral acquisition among the different
   successional stages. Early successional stages displayed plants with
   fine root morphology and AM fungi colonization to improve the root
   functional efficiencies for uptake of nutrients and faster soil resource
   exploration. Late successional stages displayed plants with fine root
   morphology and mycorrhizal symbiosis for both a lower rate of soil
   proliferation and soil exploration capacity to acquire nutrients.},

Title = {Factors affecting savanna and forest regeneration in pastures across the

Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {330},
Month = {MAR 15},
Abstract = {The Cerrado region comprises the world's most biodiverse savanna and the
   largest cultivated pastures for cattle in Brazil. Forty percent of these
   pastures are unproductive or degraded, with bare soil and native
   vegetation increasingly replacing exotic forage grasses. This study
   sought to investigate the regeneration of native vege-tation in the
   pastures of the Cerrado and to evaluate the contribution of biophysical,
   land management, and landscape attributes to this process. Across the
   Cerrado, we analyzed pasture plant communities and the attri-butes of
   pasture management intensification, fire events, landscape native
   vegetation cover, and climate and soil types of 93 active pastures and
   15 abandoned pastures. For the abandoned pastures, time since
   abandonment was an additional variable. On actively cultivated pastures,
   savanna regeneration varied from 0 to 70\%, with a di-versity of herbs
   and woody species. Pasture management was the main predictor of savanna
   regeneration on cultivated pastures. On abandoned pastures, time since
   abandonment was the main predictor. Exotic grass cover had a strong
   negative relationship with savanna regeneration and they were present
   even in pastures abandoned for 44 years. Our study reveals the potential
   of natural regeneration of the Cerrado and its particular predictors.
   The occurrence of pastures with high natural regeneration indicates that
   national policies can promote native vegetation restoration and
   silvopastoral systems with predictable, low cost implementation.},

Abstract = {Land use leads to massive habitat destruction and fragmentation in
   tropical forests. Despite its global dimensions the effects of
   fragmentation on ecosystem dynamics are not well understood due to the
   complexity of the problem. We present a simulation analysis performed by
   the individual-based model FORMIND. The model was applied to the
   Brazilian Atlantic Forest, one of the world's biodiversity hot spots, at
   the Plateau of Sao Paulo. This study investigates the long-term effects
   of fragmentation processes on structure and dynamics of different sized
   remnant tropical forest fragments (1-100 ha) at community and plant
   functional type (PFT) level. We disentangle the interplay of single
   effects of different key fragmentation processes (edge mortality,
   increased mortality of large trees, local seed loss and external seed
   rain) using simulation experiments in a full factorial design.
   Our analysis reveals that particularly small forest fragments below 25
   ha suffer substantial structural changes, biomass and biodiversity loss
   in the long term. At community level biomass is reduced up to 60\%. Two
   thirds of the mid- and late-successional species groups, especially
   shade-tolerant (late successional climax) species groups are prone of
   extinction in small fragments. The shade-tolerant species groups were
   most strongly affected; its tree number was reduced more than 60\%
   mainly by increased edge mortality. This process proved to be the most
   powerful of those investigated, explaining alone more than 80\% of the
   changes observed for this group. External seed rain was able to
   compensate approximately 30\% of the observed fragmentation effects for
   shade-tolerant species.
   Our results suggest that tropical forest fragments will suffer strong
   structural changes in the long term, leading to tree species
   impoverishment. They may reach a new equilibrium with a substantially
   reduced subset of the initial species pool, and are driven towards an
   earlier successional state. The natural regeneration potential of a
   landscape scattered with forest fragments appears to be limited, as
   external seed rain is not able to fully compensate for the observed
   fragmentation-induced changes. Our findings suggest basic
   recommendations for the management of fragmented tropical forest
   landscapes. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Among the various applications of phytosociology, the evaluation of
   natural regeneration is of great importance, mainly because it provides
   insights for ecological restoration. The objective of this study was to
   analyze the composition and phytosociological parameters of shrub and
   tree vegetation in areas of plantation of eucalyptus (Corymbia
   citriodora) and areas of native forest in the Ibura National Forest,
   located in the Sergipe state of northeastern Brazil. For this purpose,
   20 plots were sampled and all individuals with a diameter at breast
   height (DBH) >= 8 cm were measured. Sampling revealed 821 individuals in
   the forest area and 1,000 in the eucalyptus area. These individuals
   represent 84 species and the areas presented a significant difference in
   species composition, with 61 in the eucalyptus area and 65 in the Forest
   area, and only 40 species were common to both areas. There was a
   predominance of pioneer individuals in the eucalyptus area. There also
   was a significant difference in basal area, relative density and
   relative dominance, but no significant differences were observed in
   average height. It was concluded that a period of 35 years is
   insufficient for the recovery of the eucalyptus area, which remains in a
   more initial successional stage than the forest area.},

Abstract = {The Montane Ombrophilous Dense Forest belongs to Atlantic Forest's
   domain, an important biodiversity hotspot. In Brazil, most of the
   invasion reports are related to terrestrial plants, being this forest
   the most affected. In this context is the Cantareira State Park (PEC),
   Sao Paulo. The PEC is home to a remnant that has a focus of invasion by
   several plant species, including Livistona chinensis (N.J. Jacquin) R.
   Brown ex Mart., known as Chinese Fan Palm. Given the potential for
   invasion of this species, a floristic-phytosociological study was
   conducted in order to analyse a possible inhibition effect in the
   natural regeneration process of the arboreous component caused by
   juveniles individuals of Livistona chinensis, with heights varying
   between 3 and 6 m. For each palm were installed 8 plots of 1 x 1 m,
   placed in quadrants, with the palm's stipe in the center, in a way that
   half of the plots were placed under the canopy and half around the palm.
   In the analysis were considered arboreal and palms specimens >= 20 cm in
   height and with a Perimeter at Breast Height (PAP) <= 15 cm. The results
   pointed to a drastic reduced number of seedlings and saplings (28.95\%
   and 29.85\%) and of the species richness (16.13\% and 8.33\% of species)
   occurring under the canopies of these exotic palm trees in comparison
   with the surroundings (71.05\% and 70.15\% of the sampled individuals;
   and 61.29\% and 58.33\% of species, respectively). The study has shown
   the inhibiting effect of young individuals of this species on the forest
   regeneration in the PEC, by substantially reducing the richness of
   species and the abundance of arboreal individuals under the projection
   of their canopies, possibly because they serve as a shield and cause
   excessive shading of the place.},

Abstract = {Forest restoration is a strategy to reverse forest loss and degradation.
   We overviewed deforestation in the period 1975-2018 in the Brazilian
   Amazon and the projects, techniques, and scientific publications
   conducted to recover forest in the area by 2019. We used GIS to assess
   forest loss and a systematic data collection gathered from 12
   universities, five major environmental agencies, and an ad-hoc
   bibliographic survey that rendered information from 405 restoration
   projects and 152 published studies. The Brazilian Amazon has undergone
   an accelerated deforestation in the last 43 years, resulting in 20\%
   (788,353 km(2)) of its territory deforested by 2018. Deforestation rate
   was 27,033 km(2) yr(-1) between 1975 and 1987 and 14,542 km(2) yr(-1)
   between 1988 and 2018 (1.97\% yr(-1) of forest loss between 1975 and
   2018). In 2018, 41 Amazonian municipalities were classified as priority
   areas for monitoring and control deforestation and 21 additional
   municipalities were deemed as areas with controlled deforestation. Our
   survey identified 405 projects of forest restoration in 191
   municipalities between 1950 and 2017. The majority (229) of these
   projects used seedling planting as the main forest restoration
   technique. Forest restoration projects based upon agroforestry systems
   (144), assisted natural regeneration (27), and natural regeneration (5)
   were also identified. Despite a considerable number of projects and
   publications, the region still lacks scientific studies that reinforce
   the choice of best practices for forest restoration, and the information
   currently available is not enough to quantify what has already been
   recovered or the potential area to be restored.},

Abstract = {Biological invasions are complex scale-dependent processes.
   Metacommunity ecology provides the means to understand the effects of
   invasive species (IS) because it explicitly considers how local and
   regional processes interact to drive the three main components of
   biodiversity: alpha, beta, and gamma. White-popinac (Leucaena
   leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit) is a widely distributed IS in regenerating
   forests in the Atlantic Forest (Brazil). White-popinac establishment
   results in a particular spatial occupancy as the species forms dense and
   homogeneous patches, instead of spreading individuals throughout invaded
   areas. Here we took advantage of this unique spatial configuration
   formed by fragments of native forest and their respective regenerating
   areas, partially occupied by patches of white-popinac, to investigate
   how local and regional dynamics of plant metacommunities and communities
   under natural regeneration are affected by white-popinac. We conducted
   replicated multi-strata surveys in 131 communities distributed among 29
   metacommunities of regenerating forests that had different ages of
   white-popinac invasion. We found (i) Mirrored responses among local and
   regional scales: at both scales, native species richness decreased with
   the increase of invasion age, whereas IS richness increased; and (ii)
   beta-diversity of native species decreased with the increase of invasion
   age, showing that time-advance of invasion led to a homogenizing effect.
   We also found evidence that the advance of white-popinac patches towards
   regenerating forests increases with time and proximity to the forest
   fragment, which likely had indirect effects on regenerating communities
   by reducing the size of the regenerating area. Our results indicate that
   the effects of white-popinac invasions on regenerating forests can be so
   vigorous that they propagate from the local to the regional scale, via a
   decrease in beta-diversity. We reinforce the importance of considering
   multiscale approaches on assessing effects of white-popinac invasions.},

   essential elements in different vegetation formations is fundamental for
   the definition of conservation strategies. In this study, the aim was to
   evaluate the influence of the edge environment on the phytosociological
   structure of a fragment of Open Ombrophylous Forest, in Rio Largo,
   Alagoas. Five transects of 10.0 x 100.0 m were subdivided into ten 10.0
   x 10.0 m plots to collect the data. All tree individuals with Chest
   Height Circumference >= 15 cm were sampled, measured and later
   identified in the herbarium of the Institute of the Environment of
   Alagoas. For the analysis, the phytosociological parameters
   Shannon-Wiener diversity (H'), Pielou equability (J') were calculated
   after defined the successional classes and dispersion syndromes of the
   species sampled. The edge effect was analyzed by comparing the richness,
   diversity, equability and number of individuals in the interior and at
   the edge of the fragment, using the Venn diagram technique. There were
   581 arboreal individuals, of which 434 were identified as belonging to
   20 families, 24 genera and 30 morphospecies. Among the raised species,
   there were higher occurrences of early secondary (46.67\%) and late
   (23.33\%), as well as those of zoocoric dispersion (53.33\%). The

   The edge environment did not influence the establishment of species.

Title = {Resilience of lowland Atlantic forests in a highly fragmented landscape:
   Insights on the temporal scale of landscape restoration},
Journal = {FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {470},
Month = {AUG 15},
Abstract = {The Atlantic forest is one of the most threatened tropical forest
   ecosystem in the world, and despite current knowledge, its ability to
   recover structure and diversity after a disturbance is still a matter of
   debate. Quantifying carbon stocks and species diversity in forests at
   different successional stages and assessing their recovery capacity is
   important for designing local conservation and restoration strategies.
   We investigated the resilience potential of lowland Atlantic forests at
   landscape-scale using a chronosequence approach in 160 0.1-ha permanent
   plots, three old-growth and 13 second-growth forests at various stages
   of recovery. We assessed whether tree species richness, including
   species with high conservation values (endemic and threatened),
   composition and aboveground carbon stock recover along succession; and
   estimated how much of the old-growth forest values the 20-yr-old
   secondary forests had attained and the time needed to reach old-growth
   forests levels. Species richness, composition and carbon stock tended to
   recover along the chronosequence, while endemic and threatened species
   showed no relationship with forest age. After 20 yr of succession, the
   secondary forests recovered on average 52\% of total species richness,
   21\% of species composition and only 16\% of carbon stock of old-growth
   forests. We predicted that the absolute recovery of lowland Atlantic
   forests would take eight decades to thousands of years, much longer than
   the 10-40 years targeted by national efforts to restore degraded
   ecosystems. Despite slow recovery, these regenerating forests are
   important for climate mitigation and biodiversity conservation as they
   potentially sequester 1.78 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1) and harbor a number of
   species comparable to old-growth forests. Our findings indicate that
   achieving landscape restoration and conservation goals through passive
   restoration can be a challenge, highlighting the need to invest in
   management plans in areas with relatively low resilience and high
   biodiversity and carbon conservation values.},

Title = {Predicting landscape-scale biodiversity recovery by natural tropical
   forest regrowth},
Journal = {CONSERVATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {36},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Natural forest regrowth is a cost-effective, nature-based solution for
   biodiversity recovery, yet different socioenvironmental factors can lead
   to variable outcomes. A critical knowledge gap in forest restoration
   planning is how to predict where natural forest regrowth is likely to
   lead to high levels of biodiversity recovery, which is an indicator of
   conservation value and the potential provisioning of diverse ecosystem
   services. We sought to predict and map landscape-scale recovery of
   species richness and total abundance of vertebrates, invertebrates, and
   plants in tropical and subtropical second-growth forests to inform
   spatial restoration planning. First, we conducted a global meta-analysis
   to quantify the extent to which recovery of species richness and total
   abundance in second-growth forests deviated from biodiversity values in
   reference old-growth forests in the same landscape. Second, we employed
   a machine-learning algorithm and a comprehensive set of
   socioenvironmental factors to spatially predict landscape-scale
   deviation and map it. Models explained on average 34\% of observed
   variance in recovery (range 9-51\%). Landscape-scale biodiversity
   recovery in second-growth forests was spatially predicted based on
   socioenvironmental landscape factors (human demography, land use and
   cover, anthropogenic and natural disturbance, ecosystem productivity,
   and topography and soil chemistry); was significantly higher for species
   richness than for total abundance for vertebrates (median range-adjusted
   predicted deviation 0.09 vs. 0.34) and invertebrates (0.2 vs. 0.35) but
   not for plants (which showed a similar recovery for both metrics {[}0.24
   vs. 0.25]); and was positively correlated for total abundance of plant
   and vertebrate species (Pearson r = 0.45, p = 0.001). Our approach can
   help identify tropical and subtropical forest landscapes with high
   potential for biodiversity recovery through natural forest regrowth.},

Abstract = {Forest disturbance and regrowth are key processes in forest dynamics,
   but detailed information on these processes is difficult to obtain in
   remote forests such as the Amazon. We used chronosequences of Landsat
   satellite imagery (Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper and Landsat 7 Enhanced
   Thematic Mapper Plus) to determine the sensitivity of surface
   reflectance from all spectral bands to windthrow, clear-cut, and
   clear-cut and burned (cut + burn) and their successional pathways of
   forest regrowth in the Central Amazon. We also assessed whether the
   forest demography model Functionally Assembled Terrestrial Ecosystem
   Simulator (FAIES) implemented in the Energy Exascale Earth System Model
   (E3SM) Land Model (ELM), ELM-FAILS, accurately represents the changes
   for windthrow and clearcut. The results show that all spectral bands
   from the Landsat satellites were sensitive to the disturbances but after
   3 to 6 years only the near-infrared (NIR) band had significant changes
   associated with the successional pathways of forest regrowth for all the
   disturbances considered. In general, the NIR values decreased
   immediately after disturbance, increased to maximum values with the
   establishment of pioneers and early successional tree species, and then
   decreased slowly and almost linearly to pre-disturbance conditions with
   the dynamics of forest succession. Statistical methods predict that NIR
   values will return to pre-disturbance values in about 39, 36, and 56
   years for windthrow, clear-cut, and cut + burn disturbances,
   respectively. The NIR band captured the observed, and different,
   successional pathways of forest regrowth after windthrow, clear-cut, and
   cut + burn. Consistent with inferences from the NIR observations,
   ELMFAIES predicted higher peaks of biomass and stem density after
   clear-cuts than after windthrows. ELM-FAILS also predicted recovery of
   forest structure and canopy coverage back to pre-disturbance conditions
   in 38 years after windthrows and 41 years after clear-cut. The
   similarity of ELM-FAILS predictions of regrowth patterns after windthrow
   and clearcut to those of the NIR results suggests the NIR band can be
   used to benchmark forest regrowth in ecosystem models. Our results show
   the potential of Landsat imagery data for mapping forest regrowth from
   different types of disturbances, benchmarking, and the improvement of
   forest regrowth models.},

Journal = {FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {276},
Pages = {82-87},
Month = {JUL 15},
Abstract = {Aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP) represents an important
   integrated measure of resource effects on forest ecosystem functions.
   Rates of ANPP, as well as resource availability controls over ANPP, are
   poorly understood for tropical forest regrowth following agricultural
   abandonment, although such regrowth accounts for a large and growing
   proportion of tropical landscapes. Here, we report on the response of
   ANPP to inter-annual variability in dry-season precipitation and to four
   years of dry-season irrigation in a forest regrowth stand in eastern
   Amazonia. ANPP was most strongly correlated with previous-year annual
   and dry-season precipitation inputs, suggesting a lag effect of the
   influence of precipitation on ANPP. The dry-season irrigation experiment
   provides some confirmation of this lag effect: ANPP response to
   treatment was significant for 2002 and 2003, following strong
   previous-year dry seasons, but not during the first treatment year
   (2001) or 2004, following the weak 2003 dry season. ANPP response to
   both inter-annual precipitation variability and to dry-season was
   largely due to a response in aboveground biomass increment rather than
   litterfall. Drought constraints on aboveground biomass increment suggest
   that the potential of forest regrowth to sequester atmospheric carbon
   will decrease with projected reductions in regional rainfall. (C) 2012

   the anthropogenic area during the second year. Considering both the

Abstract = {Little is known about the potential of restoration plantations to
   provide appropriate understory conditions to support the establishment
   of seeds arriving from neighboring native forests. In this article, we
   investigated how seedling establishment is affected in the understory of
   restoration sites of different ages and assessed some of the potential
   environmental factors controlling this ecological process. We first
   compared the density and richness of native tree seedlings among 10-,
   22-, and 55-year-old restoration plantations within the Atlantic Forest
   region of southeastern Brazil. Then, we undertook a seed addition
   experiment in each study site, during the wet season, and compared
   seedling emergence, survival, and biomass on local versus old-growth
   forest soil (transferred from a reference ecosystem), in order to test
   whether local substrate could hamper seedling establishment. As
   expected, the oldest restoration site had higher density and richness of
   spontaneously regenerating seedlings. However, seedling establishment
   was less successful both in the oldest restoration planting and using
   substrate transferred from a reference ecosystem, where emergence and
   survival were lower, but surviving seedlings grew better. We attribute
   these results to lower light availability for seedlings in the
   understory of the oldest site and speculate that higher incidence of
   pathogens on old-growth forest soil may have increased seedling
   mortality. We conclude that the understory of young restoration
   plantations provides suitable microsite conditions at the early
   establishment phases for the spontaneous regeneration or enrichment
   planting of native trees.},

   Forest: Forest Transition and Sugarcane Expansion},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {10},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {In this study, we examine the hypothesis of a forest transition in an
   area of early expansion of the agricultural frontier over the Brazilian
   Atlantic Forest in the south-central part of the State of SAo Paulo.
   Large scale land use/cover changes were assessed by integrating Landsat
   imagery, census data, and landscape metrics. Two Landsat multi-temporal
   datasets were assembled for two consecutive periods-1995-2006 and
   2006-2013-to assess changes in forest cover according to four classes:
   (i) transition from non-forest cover to planted forest (NF-PF); (ii)
   transition from non-forest to secondary (successional) forest (NF-SF);
   (iii) conservation of planted forest (PF) and (iv) conservation of
   forest remnants (REM). Data from the two most recent, 1995/96 and 2006
   agricultural censuses were analyzed to single out major changes in
   agricultural production. The total area of forest cover, including
   primary, secondary, and planted forest, increased 30\% from 1995 to
   2013, whereas forest planted in non-forest areas (NF-PF) and
   conservation of planted forest (PF) accounted for 14.1\% and 19.6\%,
   respectively, of the total forest area by 2013. Such results showed a
   relatively important forest transition that would be explained mostly by
   forest plantations though. Analysis of the landscape metrics indicated
   an increase in connectivity among forest fragments during the period of
   study, and revealed that nearly half of the forest fragments were
   located within 50 m from riverbeds, possibly suggesting some level of
   compliance with environmental laws. Census data showed an increase in
   both the area and productivity of sugarcane plantations, while pasture
   and citrus area decreased by a relatively important level, suggesting
   that sugarcane production has expanded at the expense of these land
   uses. Both satellite and census data helped to delineate the
   establishment of two major production systems, the first one dominated
   by sugarcane plantations approximately located in the NE part of the
   study area, and a second one concentrating most of the forest
   plantations in the SW portion of the study area, where most of the
   forest transition could be observed.},

Abstract = {We are in an unprecedented moment for promoting forest restoration
   globally, with international and regional pledges to restore at least
   350 million hectares by 2030. To achieve these ambitious goals, it is
   necessary to go beyond traditional plot-scale assessments and develop
   cost-effective technologies that can monitor the structure and function
   of restored forests at much broader scales. Lidar remote sensing in
   unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) platforms can be an agile and autonomous
   method for monitoring forest restoration projects, especially under
   conditions when information updates are frequently needed in relatively
   small areas or, when using an airplane borne lidar system may be not
   financially viable. Here, we explored the potential of an UAV-borne
   lidar system to assess the outcomes of a mixed-species restoration
   plantation experiment, designed to maximize aboveground biomass (AGB)
   accumulation. The experiment was established in Brazil's Atlantic
   Forest, with 20 native tree species, by combining two levels of planting
   density and two management levels, totaling four treatment combinations
   and one control (plots left over for natural regeneration). We analyzed
   three structural variables from lidar data (canopy height, gap fraction
   and leaf area index) and one from field inventory data (AGB). Structural
   differences between the treatments and the control plots were reliably
   distinguished by the UAV-borne lidar system. AGB was strongly correlated
   with canopy height, allowing us to elaborate a predictive equation to
   use the UAV-borne lidar system for monitoring structural features in
   other restoration plantations in the region. UAV-borne lidar systems
   showed enormous potential for monitoring relatively broad-scale
   (thousands of hectares) forest restoration projects, providing an
   important tool to aid decision making and accountability in forest
   landscape restoration.},

Abstract = {Anthropogenic forest fires are occurring with increasing frequency in
   tropical forests, with negative consequences for a variety of ecological
   processes, including litterfall. Litterfall provides several ecosystem
   services, such as nutrient cycling and carbon storage, thus playing an
   important role in ecosystem functioning. We assessed the impacts of fire
   and fire-created edges on litterfall in Atlantic Forest remnants in
   Bahia, Brazil. Litterfall was assessed at monthly intervals over one
   year along seven 300 m-long transects placed perpendicular to the edge
   between the unburnt forest and the burnt forest. We installed litterfall
   traps at the edge (0 m) and 20, 40, 60, 80, 100 and 150 m into both the
   burnt and unburnt forest. The total litterfall was smaller in the burnt
   forest (mean of 2.5 +/- 2.2 SD t.ha-1.y-1) than in the unburnt forest
   (mean of 5.9 +/- 3.4 SD t.ha-1.y-1). In addition, leaf litter gradually
   increased from the edge toward the unburnt forest interior. Our results
   highlight that there is less litterfall in the burnt forest, and that
   the relative contribution of different litter types (leaves, twigs, and
   miscellaneous litter) differ between burnt forest and unburnt forest.
   The lower amount of litterfall in the burnt forest and forest edge may
   have negative consequences for the natural regeneration of these areas,
   as the ecosystem services provided by plant litter that are important
   for forest regeneration are likely to be impaired.},

Abstract = {The dynamics of adult and regenerative tree species components was
   assessed in a cloud forest in the South Plateau of Santa Catarina state,
   southern Brazil, seeking a better understanding of the process of
   vegetation development. To this end, permanent sampling plots were
   allocated, where the adult and regenerative components were
   characterized, respectively, in 2011 and 2013. All surveyed species were
   classified according to regeneration guilds into pioneer,
   light-demanding climax, and shade-tolerant climax. In 2015, a second
   tree species component survey was conducted to determine the growth of
   surviving individuals (adults) and count the recruited and dead
   individuals. For each population, the net change rates for individuals
   (adults and regenerative) and basal area (only adults) were determined.
   Proportion tests were conducted to verify whether representativeness of
   the regeneration guilds changed over the study period. The results
   showed that the forest investigated is undergoing a structuring process
   characterized by gains in number of individuals and basal area. In
   contrast, stability in species richness and representativeness of
   regeneration guilds was verified, with highlight for light-demanding
   climax species. In conclusion, the assessed forest is undergoing a
   structuring phase that favors the regeneration of light-demanding
   species.},

Title = {Atlantic Forest recovery after long-term eucalyptus plantations: The
   role of zoochoric and shade-tolerant tree species on carbon stock},
Journal = {FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {503},
Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {Currently, about a third of the world's forest areas that have been
   deforested are regrowing. These secondgrowth forests (SGF) promote
   carbon stocks and tree species richness recovery (co-benefits recovery),
   which is central to mitigating the negative impact of climate change and
   loss of biodiversity. In Brazil's Atlantic Forest, second-growth forests
   that are regrowing after long-term land use can recover diversity and
   carbon and can have important carbon-tree diversity co-benefits. Thus,
   we evaluate the recovery of tree species richness and aboveground carbon
   stock (AGC) in SGF that are regrowing after a long-period of eucalyptus
   plantations. For this we sampled 43 SGF with stand ages varying from
   1-32 years after eucalyptus plantations cutting and three reference
   old-growth forests (OGF). We considered all individuals with more than
   15 cm of circumference at breast height in one 20 x 50 m plot by patch.
   We identified all tree species, which were categorized into functional
   attributes, such as zoochoric and non-zoochoric, pioneer and
   shade-tolerant, and fleshy and dry fruits species. There were marked
   differences in species richness and AGC between OGF and SGF, but SGFs
   were not different between then. However, in 32 years these
   second-growth forests recovered -38\% of species richness and -14\% of
   carbon stock of old-growth forests. In addition, there was a
   carbon-biodiversity co-benefits mainly between zoochoric and
   shade-tolerant species richness. These results showed that these
   second-growth forests could naturally recover biodiversity and AGC.
   Possibly, this is due to the connectivity provided by land-use for
   eucalyptus plantations that induces favorable conditions for the
   recruitment of zoochoric and shade-tolerant species and thus for the
   recovery of biodiversity and AGC after eucalyptus cutting. Thus, this
   second-growth forest management can contribute to Atlantic Forest
   biodiversity conservation and carbon stock initiatives.},

Abstract = {This paper examines the role of soil fertility and land-use history on
   the rates of forest successional regrowth in five regions of the Amazon
   Basin. Sites are located in the Bragantina Region, Tome Acu Region,
   Altamira Region and Marajo Region of the State of Para, Brazil and in a
   region of the Colombian Vaupes. Methods used included vegetation
   inventories of successional and mature forests, soil sampling,
   ethnographic assessment of land-use histories, and land cover
   classification based on multi-temporal Landsat Thematic Mapper digital
   satellite data. The paper examines inter-regional differences,
   intraregional differences, and Basin-wide differences in rates of forest
   regrowth. Inter-regional differences are best explained by the
   differences between areas in soil fertility, whereas intra-regional
   differences are best explained by the differential impact of land-use
   history on forest recovery. Basin-wide differences in rates of
   succession can best be captured by differences in tree height, and
   secondarily by differences in basal area. In inter-regional comparisons
   we found that ultisols, oxisols, and spodosols present similar rates of
   regrowth, but considerably slower rates when compared to alfisols.
   During the first 5-10 years of regrowth, alfisol. areas have average
   stand height 1 m higher, and this difference doubles after 15 years of
   regrowth. In intra-regional comparisons, using one region as an example,
   we found that land-use differences are most able to explain differences.
   Areas that had been in swidden agriculture grew back at a rate of 1.5 m
   per year; as compared with 0.45 m per year for areas that had
   experienced mechanized land preparation, and 0.62 m per year for areas
   that had been in pasture. In Basin-wide comparisons we have been able to
   discriminate three distinct stages of secondary succession using
   structural criteria, across both soil and land-use types with height as
   the most predictive criteria of overall structural development. By
   comparing our five sites' data with that of other investigators, the
   paper proposes Basin-wide patterns of regrowth for each of three
   structural stages of secondary succession that facilitate linking the
   field vegetation data to remotely-sensed data of land cover. (C) 2000

Abstract = {Matrix population models may generate important information to prevent
   undesirable outcomes for endangered species. This is the case for
   Araucaria angustifolia, a Critically Endangered conifer, with little
   knowledge regarding its life history and trends in development over
   time. This study sought to investigate life-history trends of an A.
   angustifolia population in a subtropical forest in Santa Catarina,
   Brazil. Predictions based on the Lozenge regeneration model were
   established in order to determine if this model could predict changes in
   the species' population dynamics: (1) the established individuals
   exhibit long persistence and (2) seedling and sapling abundance, as well
   as population descriptors, should exhibit behaviour that indicates one
   of the stages prescribed by the model. All A. angustifolia individuals
   were evaluated within a 5.1 ha plot at the study site over a six-year
   period. Lefkovitch's transition model was used and population
   descriptors were calculated. Both predictions were fulfilled. The
   population had lambda = 0.9977 (0.9864 < lambda < 1.0020; CI 95\%),
   indicating a declining stability. The basal area remained stable,
   whereas tree density tended to decrease, and seedlings and saplings did
   not promote an increase in.. These results indicate that the population
   was in a phase called thinning, defined by the Lozenge model. The
   results led to three conclusions: recruitment seems insufficient;
   survival of reproductive individuals is responsible for the longevity of
   the population; and the predictions did not refute the Lozenge model.
   According to this model, the population is expected to regenerate in the
   future. However, the species exhibits declining stability, which
   aggravates the endangerment situation.},

Abstract = {In Brazil, the remaining areas of Atlantic Forest are intensely
   fragmented. The connection of forest fragments through ecological
   corridors is an important step in biodiversity conservation. Certain
   areas are more resilient, and in those areas, natural forest
   regeneration, for example, can be encouraged. The aim of this study was
   to identify areas of greater resilience in order to support the
   connection of Atlantic Forest fragments with ecological corridors.
   Forest fragments in the municipality of Paraiba do Sul, in the state of
   Rio de Janeiro, were mapped using the supervised maximum likelihood
   classification of an Operational Land Imager (OLI)/Landsat-8 sensor
   image. Next, we analyzed the influence of terrain attributes (aspect,
   incident solar radiation, slope, and curvature profile) on natural
   regeneration. The areas with the greatest potential to achieve natural
   regeneration and to form ecological corridors were indicated through
   fuzzy membership functions. Within Paraiba do Sul, 31\% of the territory
   is covered by vegetation in different stages of regeneration. Recordings
   were made of 1,251 forest fragments in a middle or advanced stage of
   regeneration. These fragments are usually situated in the southeast,
   south, and southwest aspects, in areas that receive the least amount of
   global solar radiation (Wh.m(-2)) per year, and on slopes with an angle
   of inclination greater than 20\%. The adjustment of fuzzy functions
   identified 17,327.5 ha with a tendency to recover, and which are
   therefore strategic areas in the development of ecological corridors.},

Abstract = {The understory of exotic tree plantations can have non-negligible native
   species richness. Ecological restoration of these sites may include the
   harvest of trees, depending on the tradeoff between timber income and
   harvest impacts on biodiversity. This study aimed to investigate how a
   site can recover from harvest disturbance, by comparing the regeneration
   of woody species in the understory of two types of 37-year-old Pinus
   taeda plantation (P1 and P2, high and low relative density of pine
   seedlings in the understory, respectively), with stands that were
   similar to P2 but subjected to harvest and then abandoned for 15years (R
   sites). Secondary forests (SF) were used as references. We sampled three
   different sites for each stand condition; soil chemical properties,
   estimations of litter mass, and canopy cover were measured. P1 had low
   species diversity, and P2 and R had 50 and 46\% of SF richness,
   respectively. The R site contained few pine saplings and was
   floristically similar to P2; this indicated that 15years was sufficient
   for the recovery of plant diversity to near pre-harvesting levels. Soil
   fertility was highest in SF and lowest in P1. Thus old plantations of P.
   taeda with low relative density of pine juveniles can be cost-effective
   starting points for restoration. Despite the destructive effects of pine
   harvest, recovery of native species can occur rapidly. In situations in
   which clearcutting of pine stands is not planned or possible, modest

Abstract = {Subsistence agriculture, cattle ranching, and periodical land
   abandonment are common land-use practices in Amazonia. Because changes
   in land use affect biogeochemical cycles, secondary forests growing
   after land abandonment develop at varying speeds and spatial patterns,
   due in part to varying nutrient dynamics. Leaf and soil nutrient
   concentrations can provide useful information on nutrient cycling
   processes and strategies of nutrient use by trees that are suitable for
   introduction to abandoned areas. To understand nutrient dynamics in
   secondary forests from different regeneration stages, as well as the
   importance of pioneer species in the regeneration process, we measured
   the concentration of macronutrients in leaves of three pioneer tree
   species (Vismia cayennensis, Cecropia sciadophylla, and Bellucia
   dichotoma) in central Amazon secondary forests. We also measured
   macronutrients in the topsoil under the trees. We found that type of
   prior land use, time since abandonment, and number of fire events were
   significantly correlated with the concentrations of leaf and soil
   macronutrients, explaining between 10 and 38\% of the variation in
   macronutrient concentrations. The observed patterns suggest that
   management practices affect the processes involved in N cycling and
   availability. Of the three pioneer species, C. sciadophylla showed the
   highest nutrient resorption efficiency and the highest leaf nutritional
   quality. We suggest that these two features determine a higher potential
   of C. sciadophylla for natural regeneration and restoration of abandoned
   lands.},

Abstract = {The Brazilian Cerrado has been converted to farmland, and there is
   little evidence that this expansion will decrease, mainly because
   agriculture is the country's main economic sector. However, the impacts
   of intense modification of land use and land cover on surface runoff and
   soil erosion are still poorly understood in this region. Here, we
   assessed surface runoff and soil loss in a woodland Cerrado area under a
   former pasture area, which was abandoned and has undergone a natural
   regeneration process for 7 years (RC). Its results were compared with
   that found in an undisturbed area of woodland Cerrado (CE), 40-month-old
   eucalyptus (3.0 X 1.8 m) (EU), and pasture under rotational grazing
   (PA). The study was conducted on Red Acrisol located in the Brazilian
   Cerrado. We performed rainfall simulations on a plot of 0.7 m(2) and
   using three constant rainfall intensities of 60, 90, and 120 mm h(-1)
   for 1 h. For each rainfall intensity, we carried out four repetitions
   using different plots in each treatment, i.e. 12 plots per treatment
   studied and 48 plots in total. We noted that the soil physical
   properties were improved in RC and, consequently, water infiltration and
   soil erosion control; RC presented surface runoff and soil loss
   different from EU and PA (alpha = 0.05). The macroporosity and soil bulk
   density affected surface runoff in RC and PA because the RC was used as
   pasture and is currently regenerating back to the cerrado vegetation. As
   the rainfall intensity increased, EU became more similar to PA, which
   showed the highest surface runoff and soil loss. Our findings indicate
   that natural regeneration processes (pasture to the cerrado vegetation)
   tend to improve the soil ecosystem services, improving infiltration and
   reducing surface runoff and soil erosion. (c) 2020 International

Title = {Swidden fallow management to increase landscape-level Brazil nut
   productivity},
Journal = {FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {464},
Month = {MAY 15},
Abstract = {Brazil nut (Bertholletia excelsa Bonpl.) is considered the cornerstone
   non-timber species of Amazonian conservation. Nuts (or seeds) of this
   massive tree are harvested by local people living in and near old growth
   forests, supporting local livelihoods and regional economies. Secondary
   forests, however, particularly plots previously used for agriculture
   (swidden fallows), present better B. excelsa seedling and sapling
   recruitment than mature forest. This study examines the extent to which
   forest residents could increase nut productivity by allowing their
   fallows to grow into Brazil nut rich forests. We conducted B. excelsa
   inventories in the Brazilian state of Acre in abandoned swidden fallows
   of different ages. We also conducted interviews to determine landowner
   perspectives on the fallow potential for increasing nut production. An
   individual-based model, based on in-situ inventories and primary and
   secondary datasets from prior fieldwork, simulated growth, survivorship
   and production from the 250 inventoried trees in 18 fallows of varying
   sizes (from 0.41 to 4.18 ha) and different regrowth stages (12 to 60
   years old). These simulation model predictions showed that after 10
   years, 2.4\% of existing trees would be productive, with an average of
   68.6 +/- 21.5 fruits per reproductively mature tree in the four fallows
   that most quickly yielded productive trees. By the final projected time
   interval (40 years), predictions suggest all fallows will produce fruits
   with cumulative production averaging 1475 +/- 359 fruits ha(-1),
   suggesting an increase in landowner income of US\$55.1 +/- 13.4 per
   hectare of fallow. Our simulation model is the first to explore fruit
   productivity of Brazil nut in secondary forest. It likely underpredicts
   B. excelsa growth and nut production, considering that swidden fallows
   provide better resource availability than the forest-derived datasets we
   used to construct the model equations. In conclusion, our findings
   support previous research that suggests that higher B. excelsa
   recruitment rates observed in abandoned swidden fallows could indeed
   translate into greater adult densities and thus potentially, higher nut
   production - a conclusion mirrored by most participant landowners.},

Abstract = {We evaluated forest structure and composition in 9- to 13-year-old
   stands established on a bauxite-mined site at Trombetas (Para), Brazil,
   using four different reforestation techniques following initial site
   preparation and topsoil replacement. These techniques included reliance
   on natural forest regeneration, mixed commercial species plantings of
   mostly exotic timber trees, direct seeding with mostly native early
   successional tree species, and mixed native species plantings of more
   than 70 tree species (the current operational restoration treatment at
   this site). Replicated fixed-radius plots in each treatment and in
   undisturbed primary forest were used to quantify the canopy and
   understory structure and the abundance and diversity of all vascular
   plant species. Treatment comparisons considered regeneration density,
   species richness and diversity for all floristic categories, and, for
   trees and shrubs, the relative contribution of initial planting; and
   subsequent regeneration from soil seed banks and seed inputs from nearby
   primary forests. With the possible exception of the stands of mixed
   commercial species, which were superior to all others in terms of tree
   basal-area development but relatively poor in species richness, all
   treatments were structurally and: floristically diverse, with a high
   probability of long-term restoration success. Of these, the mixed native
   species plantings appeared to be at least risk of ar rested succession
   due to the dominance of a broader range of tree species of different
   successional stages or expected life spans. In all treatments, several
   locally important families of primary forest trees (Annonaceae,
   Chrysobalanaceae, Lauraceae, Palmae and Sapotaceae) were markedly
   underrepresented due to a combination of poor survival of initial
   plantings and limitations on seed dispersal from the surrounding primary
   forest.},

Abstract = {The current study aims to characterize the soil seed banks in a forest
   under restoration and in a seasonal semideciduous forest remnant, as

   In total, 60 samples of soil seed banks were collected in two adjacent
   forests (30 in a 2.18-ha forest undergoing restoration process based on
   the planting of seedlings belonging to different tree species, after the
   forest was subjected to bauxite mining activity; and 30 in a 5.30-ha
   preserved forest fragment). The soil seed bank of the forest undergoing
   restoration recorded higher density of emerged seedlings than that of
   the reference ecosystem. Although the shrub-tree species in the
   investigated forests lacked floristic similarity, the highly similar
   dispersal syndrome distribution and the successional category of
   shrub-tree species in them have indicated that both forests underwent
   ecological processes. Therefore, the restoration process implemented in
   the mined area has successfully recovered the soil seed bank after a few

Abstract = {The relationships between arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and root
   morphological characteristics were studied under greenhouse conditions
   of 78 tropical native woody species and 47 seedling species collected in
   the field. Seedlings of native woody pioneer and early secondary species
   that generally exhibited fine roots with a dense cover of long root
   hairs showed higher mycorrhizal response and root mycorrhizal
   colonization than late-secondary and climax species with coarse roots
   with a sparse cover of short root hairs. Root-hair length and incidence
   decreased with the progression among the successional groups while
   fine-root diameter increased, both in the greenhouse and in the field.
   The mycorrhizal response was highly correlated to root mycorrhizal
   colonization in the greenhouse and in the field. These parameters were
   inversely correlated with the seed mass and fine-root diameter, but
   directly correlated with root-hair incidence, both in the greenhouse and
   in the field. Mycorrhizal response and root mycorrhizal colonization
   were also directly correlated with the root-hair length and root/shoot
   ratio of uninoculated plants. The seedling mycorrhizal status of the
   early successional woody species suggests that the root traits of these
   fast-growing species can be more receptive to attraction, infection and
   colonization by arbuscular mycorrhizas than root traits of
   late-successional species.},

Abstract = {Understanding the factors that influence the composition and structure
   of bee communities in natural habitats is critical for conservation and
   restoration efforts, mainly in disturbed ecosystems that are widely used
   for agricultural crop production, such as tropical dry forests (TDF).
   The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of tree species
   composition and vegetation structure on the composition, abundance and
   species richness of eusocial and non-eusocial wild bee assemblages. Bees
   (19.909 individuals of 96 species) were collected in fifteen plots in
   different secondary succession stages in a TDF in the state of Minas
   Gerais, Brazil. We found a positive relationship between tree community
   similarity and bee community similarity, for both eusocial and
   non-eusocial bees. Average tree height positively affected the abundance
   and species richness of eusocial bees, while the abundance of
   non-eusocial bees was negatively affected by tree species richness.
   Similar tree species composition and vegetation structure between plots
   at the same stage of secondary succession probably determined more
   similar bee communities than dissimilar tree communities. Most eusocial
   bee species are dependent on cavities in large trees to house their
   colonies, while most non-eusocial bees probably prefer open habitats
   because they provide a greater density and diversity of floral
   resources, and suitable areas for ground-nesting species. Since eusocial
   bees represented 94\% of the individuals sampled, the conservation and
   restoration of mature forests is of primary importance in order to
   increase eusocial bee diversity, and the maintenance of these areas in
   the vicinity of agricultural systems is crucial to increase the
   ecosystem service of pollination.},

Month = {MAR 25},
Abstract = {Passive restoration of secondary forests can partially offset loss of
   biodiversity following tropical deforestation. Tree cavities, an
   essential resource for cavity-nesting birds, are usually associated with
   old forest. We investigated the restoration time for tree cavities
   suitable for cavity-nesting birds in secondary forest at the Biological
   Dynamics of Forest Fragments Project (BDFFP) in central Amazonian
   Brazil. We hypothesized that cavity abundance would increase with forest
   age, but more rapidly in areas exposed to cutting only, compared to
   areas where forest was cut and burned. We also hypothesized that
   cavities would be lower, smaller, and less variable in secondary forest
   than in old-growth forest, which at the BDFFP is part of a vast lowland
   forest with no recent history of human disturbance. We used pole-mounted
   cameras and tree-climbing to survey cavities in 39 plots (each 200 x 40
   m) across old-growth forests and 11-34-year-old secondary forests. We
   used generalized linear models to examine how cavity supply was related
   to forest age and land-use history (cut only vs cut-and-burn), and
   principal components analysis to compare cavity characteristics between
   old-growth and secondary forest. Cavity availability increased with
   secondary forest age, regardless of land-use history, but the oldest
   secondary forest (31-34 years) still had fewer cavities (mean +/- SE =
   9.8 +/- 2.2 cavities ha(-1)) than old-growth forest (20.5 +/- 4.2
   cavities ha(-1)). Moreover, secondary forests lacked cavities that were
   high and deep, with large entrances-characteristics likely to be
   important for many species of cavity-nesting birds. Several decades may
   be necessary to restore cavity supply in secondary Amazonian forests,
   especially for the largest birds (e.g., forest-falcons and parrots > 190
   g). Retention of legacy trees as forest is cleared might help maintain a
   supply of cavities that could allow earlier recolonization by some
   species of cavity-nesting birds when cleared areas are abandoned. A

Abstract = {We know surprisingly little about the fate of seeds of the Brazil nut
   tree (Bertholletia excelsa) under natural conditions. Here we
   investigate seed removal, predation and caching of Brazil nuts by
   scatter-hoarding rodents in the wet and dry seasons, based on an
   experimental approach using 900 thread-marked seeds. We tracked the fate
   of seeds handled by these animals to examine how seasonal food
   availability may influence caching rates, dispersal distances and cache
   longevity. Most seeds exposed to dispersal trials were removed by
   scatter-hoarders during the first week in both seasons and seeds were
   generally buried intact in single-seeded caches within 10 m of seed
   stations. Seeds were removed significantly faster and buried at greater
   distances during the dry season. The proportion of seeds buried intact
   was considerably higher in the wet season (74.4\%) than in the dry
   season (38.2\%). Most (99.4\%) of the 881 primary caches monitored were
   recovered, but these had a significantly shorter lifetime in the dry
   season. Our results show that rodents are highly skilled at retrieving
   buried Brazil nuts and that caching behaviour appears to be affected by
   seasonal resource abundance. Reduced seed availability due to intensive
   harvest could potentially create a dry-season scenario where most seeds
   succumb to pre-dispersal predation. thereby adversely affecting the
   natural regeneration of Brazil nut trees.},

Title = {Ecological descriptors in environmental impact assessments: An urgent
   review of the method in Brazilian reports},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT REVIEW},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {106},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Worldwide, important biodiversity hotspots have been threatened by land
   use change, placing several species at risk. Some gaps in environmental
   licensing system represent challenges for the nature conservation and
   should be further investigated. Far beyond conservation strategies, the
   process of legalizing land use of some countries urgently needs to be
   reviewed, especially in places that host biological megadiversity, such
   as the Atlantic Forest, southeastern Brazil. This is the first multiple
   case study that evaluates the use of ecological descriptors in
   environmental impact assessment involving vegetation in different
   successional stages of the Atlantic Forest. The methodology was divided
   into two steps, i) the selection of the reports in a public
   environmental agency of Sao Paulo State and ii) the assessment of
   ecological criteria inherent to the vegetation survey. This study
   verified a scarcity of reports presenting adequate ecological
   descriptors according to the law in their reports, which would improve
   the assessment of the natural environmental framework. Although
   ecological parameters appear in some reports, they do not show relevant
   information, even though for the characterization of the succession
   stages of the forest fragments, thus hiding important information and
   leaving aside a parameter that should be essential in the
   approval/disapproval of reports. Thus, we suggest that the data
   presented and accepted by the Public Environmental Agency of Sao Paulo,
   Brazil, did not adequately characterize the stages of ecological
   succession in the studied areas, thus putting some ecological patterns
   and processes at risk. This issue must be urgently reviewed so reports
   should show the real threats for biodiversity.},

Abstract = {The present study investigated changes in photosynthetic characteristics
   of Guazuma ulmifolia Lam. (early successional species) and Hymenaea
   courbaril L. (late successional species) grown in contrasting light
   conditions as a way of assessing photosynthetic plasticity. Early
   successional species typically inhabit gap environments being exposed to
   variability in multiple resources, hence it is expected that these
   species would show higher photosynthetic plasticity than late
   successional ones. In order to test this hypothesis, light and CO2
   response curves and chlorophyl1 content (Ch1) were measured in plants
   grown in high and low light environments. G. ulmifolia presented the
   highest amounts of both Ch1 a and b, especially in the low light, and
   both species presented higher Ch1 a than b in both light conditions. The
   Ch1 a/b ratio was higher in high light leaves of both species and
   greater in G. ulmifolia. Taken together, these results evidence the
   acclimation potential of both species, reflecting the capacity to
   modulate light harvesting complexes according to the light environment.
   However, G. ulmifolia showed evidence of higher photosynthetic
   plasticity, as indicated by the greater amplitude of variation on
   photosynthetic characteristics between environments shown by more
   significant shade adjusted parameters (SAC) and principal component
   analysis (PCA). Thus, the results obtained were coherent with the
   hypothesis that the early successional species G. ulmifolia exhibits
   higher photosynthetic plasticity than the late successional species H.

Title = {Biological soil crusts decrease infiltration but increase erosion
   resistance in a human-disturbed tropical dry forest},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {14},
Month = {APR 20},
Abstract = {Under continuous human disturbance, regeneration is the basis for
   biodiversity persistence and ecosystem service provision. In tropical
   dry forests, edaphic ecosystem engineering by biological soil crusts
   (biocrusts) could impact regeneration by influencing erosion control and
   soil water and nutrient fluxes, which impact landscape hydrology,
   geomorphology, and ecosystem functioning. This study investigated the
   effect of cyanobacteria-dominated biocrusts on water infiltration and
   aggregate stability in a human-modified landscape of the Caatinga dry
   forest (NE Brazil), a system characterized by high levels of forest
   degradation and increasing aridity. By trapping dust and swelling of
   cyanobacterial filaments, biocrusts can seal soil surfaces and slow down
   infiltration, which potentially induces erosion. To quantify hydraulic
   properties and erosion control, we used minidisc-infiltrometry,
   raindrop-simulation, and wet sieving at two sites with contrasting
   disturbance levels: an active cashew plantation and an abandoned field
   experiencing forest regeneration, both characterized by sandy soils.
   Under disturbance, biocrusts had a stronger negative impact on
   infiltration (reduction by 42\% vs. 37\% during regeneration), although
   biocrusts under regenerating conditions had the lowest absolute
   sorptivity (0.042 +/- 0.02 cm s(-1/2)) and unsaturated hydraulic
   conductivity (0.0015 +/- 0.0008 cm s(-1)), with a doubled water
   repellency. Biocrusts provided high soil aggregate stability although
   stability increased considerably with progression of biocrust succession
   (raindrop simulation disturbed: 0.19 +/- 0.22 J vs. regenerating: 0.54
   +/- 0.22 J). The formation of stable aggregates by early successional
   biocrusts on sandy soils suggests protection of dry forest soils even on
   the worst land use/soil degradation scenario with a high soil erosion
   risk. Our results confirm that biocrusts covering bare interspaces
   between vascular plants in human-modified landscapes play an important
   role in surface water availability and erosion control. Biocrusts have
   the potential to reduce land degradation, but their associated ecosystem
   services like erosion protection, can be impaired by disturbance.
   Considering an average biocrust coverage of 8.1\% of the Caatinga
   landscapes, further research should aim to quantify the contribution of
   biocrusts to forest recovery to fully understand the role they play in
   the functioning of this poorly explored ecosystem.},

Abstract = {To evaluate the role played by the spatial resolution in distinguishing
   land cover classes in the Amazon region, different levels of spatial
   resolution (60, 100, 120, 200 and 250 meters) were simulated from a
   Landsat\_5 Thematic Mapper (TM) image. Thematic maps were produced by
   visual interpretation from the original (30 x 30 meters) and simulated
   set of images. The map legend included primary forest, old and young
   woody secondary succession, and non-forest. The results indicated that
   for the discrimination between primary forest and non-forest, spatial
   resolution did not have great influence for pixel size equal or lower
   than 200 meters, The contrary was verified for the identification of old
   and young woody secondary vegetation due to their occurrence in small
   polygons. To avoid significant changes in the calculated area of these
   land cover types, a spatial resolution better than 100 meters is
   required. This result is an indication that the use of the future
   Brazilian remote sensing satellite (SSR-1) for secondary succession
   identification may be unreliable, especially for latitudes between
   S10degrees and S15degrees where critical areas of deforestation are
   located and pixel size is expected to vary within the same scene from

Abstract = {Understanding tropical forest succession is critical for the development
   of tropical forest conservation strategies worldwide, given that
   tropical secondary forests can be considered the forests of the future.
   Tropical dry forests (TDF) are among the most threatened tropical
   ecosystems, there are more secondary forests and forest restoration
   efforts that require a better understanding of successional processes.
   The main goal of this synthesis for this special issue on the ecology
   and management of tropical dry forests in the Americas is to present a
   summarized review of the current knowledge of the ecology and management
   implications associated to TDF succession. We explore specific issues
   associated to tropical dry forest succession with emphasis on the use of
   chronosequences, plant diversity and composition, plant phenology and
   remote sensing, pollination, and animal-plant interactions; all under
   the integrating umbrella of ecosystem succession. We also emphasize the
   need to conduct socio-ecological research to understand changes in
   land-use history and its effects on succession and forest regeneration
   of TDF. We close this paper with some thoughts and ideas associated with
   the strong need for an integrating dimension not considered until today:
   the role of cyberinfrastructure and eco-informatics as a tool to support
   sound conservation, management and understanding of TDF in the Americas.

Abstract = {The objective of this study was to evaluate the natural regeneration in
   permanent preservation areas (PPA) in forest restoration process after
   Pinus sp. harvest through the survey of phytosociological parameters..
   The study was carried out in the PPA, associated with springs and rivers
   in two areas with different post-harvest ages of Pinus sp., being
   inserted in Mixed Ombrophilous Forest (MOF - 7 years old) and Dense
   Ombrophilous Forest in transition (DOF/MOF - 12 years old) both in the
   Santa Catarina state. Nineteen rectangular plots with dimensions of 25 m
   x 4 m (100 m(2)) were allocated at random in each one of the areas, for
   the floristic-structural evaluation of the tree-shrub regenerative
   component. In the DOF in transition, 913 regenerating individuals of
   tree and shrub species were sampled, belonging to 90 species, 60 genera
   and 30 botanical families. The species with the highest importance value
   were Cupania vernalis (8.71\%), followed by Bernardia pulchella
   (5.93\%), Aureliana wettsteiniana (5.25\%). At MOF, an area undergoing
   restoration in less time, 782 regenerating individuals of tree and shrub
   species were sampled, belonging to 62 species, 21 botanical families and
   30 genera. The species with the highest importance value were Myrsine
   coriacea (10.06\%), Solanum variabile (9.79\%), Myrsine lorentziana
   (7.08\%). Shannon's diversity indexes were H' = 3.76 for DOF in
   transition and H' = 3.24 for MOF, and showed a high diversity of
   species, whereas the Pielou equability index obtained J = 0.81 for DOF
   in transition and J = 0.77 for MOF, showing high uniformity in the
   distribution of individuals in the species for the two areas. The
   diametric distribution of the individuals showed an ``inverted J{''}
   pattern for both phytophysiognomies, behavior expected in native
   forests. The NMDS (Non-metric multidimensional scaling) presented a
   stress value of 9.81\% indicating suitability of the ordering and
   allowing inferences to be made with reliability. Through the NMDS
   ordering, it was observed the formation of two distinct
   floristic-structural groups, associated with MOF phytophysiognomies and
   MOF/DOF transition. All plots inserted in MOF areas are grouped to the
   right in the ordering, while most plots inserted in the MOF/DOF
   transition area are grouped to the left of the ordering. The tree-shrub
   regenerative component evaluated in post-harvest areas of Pinus sp. at
   both phytophysiognomies has a great diversity of species with great
   importance for forest formation, being a favorable environment for the
   conservation of species and essential to guarantee the succession of the
   forest and the restoration resilience.},

Title = {Recovery of dung beetle assemblages in regenerating Caatinga dry forests
   following slash-and-burn agriculture},
Journal = {FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {496},
Month = {SEP 15},
Abstract = {Understanding patterns of tropical forest resilience is a central
   challenge in conservation ecology particularly in seasonally-dry
   tropical forests, where anthropogenic disturbance and climate change are
   pervasive threats. Here, we investigate the recovery rate and community
   organization of dung beetles along a Caatinga dry forest regeneration
   cline in the context of slash-and-burn agriculture in northeast Brazil.
   Assemblages were described considering a wide set of attributes,
   including abundance, taxonomic (Hill orders D-0, D-1 and D-2) and
   functional diversity (functional richness, evenness and redundancy) and
   taxonomic/functional composition, across a chronosequence consisting of
   regenerating and old-growth forest stands exposed to different levels of
   aridity and chronic disturbance. In addition, we use body mass, diet,
   food relocation behaviour and habitat specificity of dung beetles as
   ecological attributes. Our results show that Caatinga dry forests
   supports dense but relatively impoverished dung beetle assemblages at
   both local and landscape scales, with the same small set of species
   dominating local assemblages. Dung beetles do not experience
   successional replacements along the regeneration gradient, with evidence
   of high resilience. Moreover, disturbance-associated dung beetle species
   (predominantly small-bodied generalists) resulted in assemblage
   convergence across the regeneration cline. Finally, chronic
   anthropogenic disturbance was a decisive driver of changes in abundance
   and taxonomic diversity, while aridity positively affected species
   composition and functional richness. These patterns resulted in the
   occurrence of spatially structured assemblages in response to a
   combination of both natural and anthropogenic variables, while under
   little or no influence of forest regeneration status across
   human-modified Caatinga landscapes. We conclude that the absence of
   directional changes in dung beetle assemblages through the forest
   succession pathway of regenerating second-growth forest is associated
   with the effect of aridity and human disturbances on community
   organization, including selection for certain species and functional
   groups, which in turn, can alter important ecological functions and
   consequently the resilience of dry forests.},

Abstract = {Studies on land-use and land-cover change patterns contribute to better
   informed management decisions for the conservation and restoration of
   Atlantic Forest fragments and their megabiodiversity. In recent decades,
   the phenomenon of forest transition has been observed in several parts
   of the biome, including in highly urbanized and metropolitan areas such
   as Campinas, in the state of S \& atilde;o Paulo. Here, we examine
   land-use and land-cover change (using MapBiomas data with 30 m spatial
   resolution) within the Campinas Environmental Protection Area, where
   natural forest cover increased from 9\% to 17.1\% of the total area
   between 1985 and 2023. Exogenous socioeconomic factors, including the
   gradual replacement of agricultural activities by tourism development
   and the designation of areas through successive ecological-economic
   zonings, are presented as possible causes of the decrease in
   deforestation and the stabilization and recovery of the remaining
   natural forest cover. Our analysis reaffirms evidence from other studies
   showing that secondary succession in abandoned pastures contributed to
   the forest transition process identified in the region. Strongly
   decreasing trends were identified for pasture areas and strongly
   increasing trends for forest formations and urban infrastructure. Based
   on analysis of forest formation transitions conducted at 5-year
   intervals between 1985 and 2020, we observed different patterns of net
   change between the local, regional, and macroregional levels and the
   state and biome levels. Our analysis of land-use and land-cover
   transitions for the most recent years (2018 to 2023), including the
   period of validity of the EPA Management Plan, indicates that the
   ecological-economic zoning instrument is effective in containing
   potential threats; however, it has limitations, since losses of forest
   formation were observed in all five conservation zones. We emphasize
   that, although we can attest to the effectiveness of ecological-economic
   zoning, which in the EPA region has undergone incremental adaptations
   favorable to the forest transition process, this management instrument
   is subject to changes in its limits and regulations based on the
   governance system established at its different levels.},

Abstract = {Tropical forests disappear rapidly because of deforestation, yet they
   have the potential to regrow naturally on abandoned lands. We analyze
   how 12 forest attributes recover during secondary succession and how
   their recovery is interrelated using 77 sites across the tropics.
   Tropical forests are highly resilient to low-intensity land use; after
   20 years, forest attributes attain 78\% (33 to 100\%) of their
   old-growth values. Recovery to 90\% of old-growth values is fastest for
   soil (<1 decade) and plant functioning (<2.5 decades), intermediate for
   structure and species diversity (2.5 to 6 decades), and slowest for
   biomass and species composition (>12 decades). Network analysis shows
   three independent clusters of attribute recovery, related to structure,
   species diversity, and species composition. Secondary forests should be
   embraced as a low-cost, natural solution for ecosystem restoration,
   climate change mitigation, and biodiversity conservation.},

   the fixed plots method, systematically, were allocated 5 bands of 1,200
   m(2) (20m x 60m) divided into 3 subunits of 20 x 20m, sampling 15units.
   Within the plots were sampled all individuals with circumference at
   breast height (CBH) >= 6 cm. The vegetation structure was evaluated by
   all phytosociological parameters, we calculated the Shannon diversity
   index (H'). The analysis of the hypsometric and diametric distribution
   was made by histograms, with intervals of 3 cm and 5 m respectively.
   Were sampled 2.067 individuals, with 29 botanical families, 59 genera
   and 70 species distributed among ecological groups, 18 pioneer, 24 early
   secondary, 20 late successional and 8 climax of households found the
   highest species number were Fabaceae and Annonaceae. The density was
   3.445 ind ha(-1) and a basal area of 14.06 m(2) ha(-1). This fragment
   shows a large number of individuals and species, the transition area has
   an important species number, presenting quite heterogeneous, the closest
   portions of the river (0 to 20m and 20 to 40m) was observed greater
   number of species and individuals. Besides contributing to the knowledge
   and species richness this study serves as the basis with respect to the
   vegetation width to be maintained.},

Abstract = {Because of continuing degradation or deforestation in areas of
   undisturbed primary forest, there is a need to study the relative merit
   of strategies that mitigate their impacts on biodiversity and associated
   ecological functionality. Here, we provide a global synthesis of forest
   degradation or deforestation using 48 studies published in peer-reviewed
   journals that use dung beetles as indicators given their sensitivity to
   anthropogenic disturbance and their relevance in performing essential
   ecological functions in terrestrial ecosystems. We evaluated forest
   cover associated with undisturbed primary forest degradation (i.e.
   degraded primary forest) and undisturbed primary forest deforestation
   (i.e. secondary forest, forestry plantations and forestry restoration
   implementation) on species richness, total abundance, biomass,
   functional groups' presence and ecological functions provided by dung
   beetles. Additionally, we determined whether if dung beetle responses to
   forest disturbances were geographically dependent. We found lower
   diversity and a decrease in ecological functions associated with all
   classes of disturbance in primary forest. However, the effects were less
   severe in the case of forest degradation compared to complete
   deforestation with natural regeneration of secondary forest, development
   of forest plantations or active forest restoration by planting
   indigenous trees. The Neotropical and Oriental regions are particularly
   vulnerable, given the elevated rates of undisturbed primary forest
   deforestation and its negative impact on their assemblages' diversity
   and ecological functions. Synthesis and applications. Our results show
   that efforts for the conservation of remaining undisturbed primary
   forests need to be prioritized, especially in tropical latitudes.
   However, in regions where primary forest conservation is not feasible,
   logging management programs in degraded primary forest may have a
   potential role in reducing negative impacts for dung beetle diversity
   and ecological functions. Moreover, we conclude that despite the
   negative effect of primary forest deforestation and implementation of
   secondary forest, forestry plantation and forestry restoration, they can
   be useful for partial recovery of diversity and ecological functions
   performed by dung beetles in areas lacking any primary forest
   (undisturbed or degraded) vegetation cover.},

Abstract = {Preserved vegetation fragments can serve as islands or germplasm banks
   that aid in the recuperation of anthropogenically degraded areas. The
   present study evaluated the effects of the distance to a preserved
   forest fragment on the recuperation of an abandoned agricultural field
   that had been naturally regenerating for 15 years in Caruaru, PE,
   Brazil. Seven 240 m transects were laid out perpendicular to the border
   between the abandoned field and preserved forest fragment, and each
   transect was divided into twelve 5 x 20 m contiguous plots, thus forming
   12 bands at progressive distances from the preserved site. The height
   and diameter of all live individuals within each plot with a stem
   diameter >= 3 cm at ground level were recorded. At the community level,
   the number of individuals, their average heights and their maximum
   diameters did not demonstrate any statistically significant relationship
   with increasing distance from the preserved vegetation fragment. Only a
   few species demonstrated any relationship between the distance to the
   preserved fragment and density, basal area or ecological importance. The
   anthropogenically altered area had higher numbers of individuals of
   autochoric species than the numbers of anemochorous and zoochoric
   species. The relatively long period of abandonment of the area
   apparently masked part of the role of the preserved forest fragment in
   restoring the altered area through dispersal because some species could
   have sprouted from cut stems, while others could have germinated
   directly from the soil seed bank. The species Croton blanchetianus and
   Cordia trichotoma were identified as principal colonizers in the initial
   phases of succession. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {This study was conducted in the Cachoeira River Natural Reserve, in
   Antonina, Parana state, Brazil. The main goal was to assess the litter
   production of secondary tropical rain forests in different sucessional
   stages (initial, medium and advanced stages). The litter fall was
   collected every 3 weeks during four years (2004 to 2007), in circular
   litter traps of 0.25m(2), distributed in 30 plots of 100m(2) of area. A
   total of 60 litter traps were installed in an area of 3000m(2). The
   litter fall collected at each retrieval date was dried, separated into
   fractions (leaves, twigs, reproductive organs and miscellaneous) and
   weighed. Leaves of some tree species were selected from the total litter
   for a specific study of their contribution to the total litter The
   average annual litter production for the three years was 5201, 5399 and
   5323 kg.ha(-1).year(-1), and the percentage contribution of the leaf
   fraction was 77, 75 and 68\%. in the initial, medium and advanced
   sucessional stages, respectively The leaf litter fraction produced in
   the initial stage was dominated by the species Tibouchina pulchra
   (jacatirao) (75\%), but in the medium and advanced stages the dominance
   of only one tree species in leaf litter fraction did not occur The
   production of twigs and reproductive organs did not differ statistically
   among the sucessional stages. The production of miscellaneous fraction
   was higher in the advanced stage and did not differ between the initial
   and medium stages. In general, the differences in litter production were
   little along the sucessional stage in the area of the study.},

Abstract = {Monoculture of pine alters the soil fauna community structure, but
   forest farms, mixed with natural areas, are restoring the original
   vegetation to protect, the diversity and ecosystem functions. In
   restoration initiatives it is necessary to consider the soil fauna.
   Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate how the process of
   restoration of the soil community occurs over time in areas after pine
   harvesting. Areas in natural regeneration with 4 and 10 years, pine
   plantations adjacent to these areas (representing previous use), and
   areas of natural forest (reference) were evaluated, it was evaluated
   three areas per treatment, with six sampling points spaced 30 m apart,
   totalling 18 sampling points for each treatment (n = 18). Soil mesofauna
   and macrofauna were collected through soil monoliths and pitfall traps.
   The comparison of the statistical analysis was to check for changes in
   the soil fauna over time (4 and 10 years) compared with that observed in
   secondary forest areas. The study showed that, along the natural
   regeneration time (4 and 10 years), it was observed increments in the
   diversity and evenness of the soil community and a reduction in the
   dominance of groups like Formicidae and increases in the community
   structure complexity with the resurgence of micropredators/regulators
   (Collembola and Acari), litter transformers (Oligochaeta, Diplopoda,
   Blattodea, Coleoptera (Larva), Diptera (Larva) and Coleoptera) and
   predators (Pseudoscorpiones, Opiliones, Symphyla and Coleoptera) after
   10 years of natural regeneration, the areas have already recovered
   groups with important ecosystem functions, but are not yet at the level
   of abundance, functional diversity and community structure of native
   forest areas. The 4- and 10-year regeneration areas present major number
   of soil fauna groups of native forest (20 groups in regeneration areas
   and 17 in the native forest areas). Even so, the forest showed a major
   complexity of soil fauna community structure, evidenced by the
   diversity. This study contributes to the understanding of natural
   regeneration for soil fauna along a temporal gradient and these findings
   can guide the conservation of regional soil fauna diversity.
   Over the time of regeneration, there were gains in soil fauna groups.
   Micropredators/regulators, litter transformers and predator groups were
   recovered. Regeneration had less dominant soil fauna groups and higher
   community complexity. Ten years was not enough time for achieving soil
   community structure like a forest. image},

Abstract = {The spatial and temporal distributions of vegetation can be influenced
   by edaphic and environmental factors as well as disturbances. The
   present study was undertaken to characterize the distribution and
   spatial dependence of species diversity in a fragment of semideciduous
   seasonal forest after a disturbance event by fire and to identify
   changes during natural regeneration. The fire, occurred in 1999, and
   surveys were undertaken in 2000, 2005 and 2014 in 26 geo-referenced
   plots (400 m(2)) distributed along two transects. The Fire Damage Index
   (FDI) in each plot was based on a scale from 0 to 5, and all of the
   arboreal individuals with diameters at breast height (DBH) >= 5 cm were
   identified in each plot. Species diversity was calculated using the
   Shannon index (H'), and species richness (S) was estimated using species
   accumulation curves; variations between the surveys compared based on
   the means and standard errors. The S, H' and FDI data were submitted to
   non-spatial exploratory and geostatistical analyses. After adjusting the
   semivariograms, the levels of spatial dependence were classified, and
   interpolation of the variables values were performed using ordinary
   kriging to characterize their spatial distributions in the form of maps.
   Spatial analysis was used to identify and characterize differences
   between the post-fire surveys in terms of the configurations of the
   arboreal community. The fire event influenced the spatial and temporal
   structures of the variables S and H'. These variables showed spatial
   dependence and aggregated distributions, with reduction in the distance
   under spatial influences and a uniformity of individuals distribution in
   the forest fragment at the different surveys. This research
   characterized the distribution and spatial dependence of the variables S
   and H' in a forest fragment after a fire event and the alterations in
   the arboreal community structure during natural regeneration.},

Abstract = {The objective of this study was to test different rescue strategies of

   conducted in a completely randomized design, in split-plots, with the
   first one consisting of four levels of shading (0 or full sun, 30, 50

   four levels of shading and three leaf reduction intensities (0, 50 and
   100\%). After 150 days from the rescue, the survival and increments in
   height and diameter were obtained. The general mean survival was 26.1\%
   in the first experiment and 26.7\% in the second one. In both
   experiments the plants in full sun resulted in 100\% mortality, while
   the 70\% shading showed to be more effective concerning the survival and
   in the growth resumption. It is recommended to use substrates whose
   mixture has at least 50\% subsoil as one of its components. Overall, the
   results obtained by leaf reduction were not sufficient to justify and

Abstract = {Outside of agroforestry disciplines, ``orchards{''} and ``forests{''}
   are usually studied through different fields of knowledge or are mired
   in conflicting views. Our study aimed to provide preliminary information
   on regeneration in cashew orchards by studying the effect of previous
   land cover, the surrounding landscape, and orchards' age on the density
   of species and number of plants. We followed linear transects in
   orchards planted in areas previously covered by savannah and forest. We
   found typical forest species growing in the understory, even in orchards
   previously occupied by savannah or as old as 42 years. The density of
   species is higher in orchards planted in previously forested plots and
   in more forested environments. Species density in the understory
   decreases as orchards get older, but it seems that it increases again
   after a certain age threshold. This study shows that cashew orchards in
   Cantanhez retain their potential for succession to forest, and
   highlights the continuum that may exist between orchards and forests.
   More research is needed to assess a possible ``forestization{''} of the
   savannahs through cashew plantations.},

Abstract = {Following perturbation, different assemblages that originate under the
   same abiotic conditions initiate successional pathways that may continue
   to diverge or converge toward an eventual climax. Forest regeneration in
   the Central Amazon begins with alternative successional pathways
   associated with prior land use. In a 12-yr study of secondary forests,
   initially ranging between 2 and 19yrs after abandonment, we compared
   species compositions through time along two pathways, abandoned
   clear-cuts dominated by Cecropia and abandoned pastures dominated by
   Vismia; prior results at these sites have not directly evaluated species
   composition. At all ages, the Chao-Jaccard similarity index of species
   composition was highest comparing pasture transects to each other,
   lowest comparing pastures transects to clear-cut transects, and
   intermediate comparing clear-cut transects to each other. Through time,
   clear-cut transects became less similar to each other, as did pasture
   transects. Changes in similarity reflected declining dominance along
   both pathways, but Cecropia dominance of clear-cut transects declined
   more rapidly than Vismia dominance of pasture transects. A rich
   association of species replaced Cecropia in clear-cut transects,
   resulting in decreased similarity among them. In pasture transects one
   genus, Bellucia, replaced the lost Vismia, so similarity of Vismia
   transects was maintained despite some turnover in dominance. Overall,
   even with turnover of individuals and decline of the dominant pioneers,
   the alternative pathways exhibited strikingly different species
   assemblies after two decades of succession, suggesting that the effect
   of land use persists well beyond initial floristic composition.},

   (RCD) and treatment (rootstock or bare-root) affected survival and
   growth. Rootstock and larger seedlings presented higher levels of
   survival and growth. Higher seedling quality in the rootstock treatment
   is due to higher water stress tolerance. Rootstock seedlings with more
   than 1 cm of initial RCD had over 80\% of survival probability, while
   small bare-root seedlings had mean survival probability as low as 20\%.
   Rootstock seedlings grew as much as fourfold more than bare-root. Using

Abstract = {Ecological restoration aims to recover an ecosystem to a state before
   degradation. Comparison to reference ecosystems (old-growth forests) is
   a key component to define if restoration goals have been achieved
   ({''}success{''}). Nevertheless, it is still unknown how the functional
   composition of the initial community influences the trajectory of the
   ecosystem through time. Here, we evaluated restoration success based on
   the functional trajectory of six 20-year-old forest communities planted
   in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest with distinct combinations of
   ecological groups (pioneers, secondary, and climax). These six
   communities ranged their species predominance regarding resource-use
   strategies, potential size, and functional diversity. To evaluate
   restoration success, we compared the functional trajectory between the
   six planted communities after 20 years of secondary succession and
   calculated their trajectories toward or away from the reference
   ecosystem. We found that the initial composition influenced the
   functional trajectory of the communities undergoing restoration and it
   was a key element to their success. Only the community planted using the
   highest functional diversity (i.e. pioneer + early and late secondary +
   climax species) became functionally similar to the reference ecosystem
   20 years after planting. The functional trajectories were mostly driven
   by the mortality of planted individuals than by the colonization of new
   species. The regeneration is still functionally similar independently of
   the treatment evidencing little influence of priority effects in this
   stage of succession. Our study indicated that the initial functional
   composition of planted forest communities influences the magnitude and
   direction of their functional trajectory and may influence restoration
   success.},

Abstract = {Fast-growing plant species are plentiful at the early stages of
   succession and possess roots with greater capacity for soil exploration
   than slow-growing plant species of late stages. Thus, the dynamics of
   fine-root production, morphological traits and arbuscular mycorrhizal
   fungal (AMF) infection intensity were assessed monthly over 1 y in the
   grassland, scrub, secondary and mature forests of the Atlantic Forest
   ecosystem, amounting to 13 consecutive samplings. Fine roots were
   sampled in three 100 x 100-m plots at each study site. Each plot was
   subdivided in five 20 x 100-m subplots and 15 soil samples were randomly
   taken from a depth of 0-5 cm in soil within each plot. The average of
   the fine-root dry mass increased from 1.39 mg cm(-3) soil in the
   grassland to 3.37 mg cm(-3) in the secondary forest; fine-root tip
   diameter varied from 146 mu m in the grassland to 303 mu m in the mature
   forest; tissue density from 0.24 g cm(-3) root in the grassland to 0.30
   g cm(-3) in the mature forest and fine-root length was 4.52 cm cm-3 soil
   in the grassland and 6.48 cm cm(-3) soil in the secondary forest. On the
   other hand, fine-root specific length decreased from 43.9 m g(-1) root
   to 18.3 m g(-1) root in the mature forest; incidence of root hairs was
   67\% in the grassland and 30\% in the mature forest; the length of root
   hairs was 215 mu m in the grassland and 112 mu m in the mature forest;
   and the intensity of AMF infection decreased from 66\% in the grassland
   to 17\% in the mature forest. In addition to AMF infection, the
   environmental variation also affected dry mass production and
   morphological traits of fine roots. During the cool season, fine-root
   dry mass, fine-root length, incidence and length of root hairs and
   intensity of AMF infection decreased compared with the warm season. We
   verified that the potential for soil exploration, that expresses the
   capacity for nutrient acquisition via fine roots and AMF infection
   intensity, decreased during the cool season and with the advance of the
   successional groups. These results indicate that fine-root traits and
   intensity of AMF infection are influenced by the intrinsic nutrient
   requirements of the plant species in each ecological group.},

   vertexes of each plot. The tree stratum was composed by 26 species of 14
   families and the natural regeneration stratum by 49 species of 23
   families. The Shannon diversity index for species, considering all
   plots, was 2.60 and 3.06 to the tree and natural regeneration strata,
   respectively. The native species, Casearia sylvestris, Myrsine
   lorentziana and Zanthoxylum petiolare presented the larger importance
   value in the tree stratum and Faramea marginata, Myrsine lorentziana and
   Myrcia glabra the biggest density in the natural regeneration stratum.
   The ecological characteristics of the species found ill several height
   strata indicated that the forest succession process is in evolution. The
   black-wattle did not regenerate in this area and the planted trees of
   this species are in the senescence phase. Only 100 tree/ha of
   black-wattle were found, which represents 4.5\% of the original

Abstract = {We aimed to evaluate the regenerative potential of the tree component in
   an ecotonal area between Araucaria and Deciduous forests, in the Upper
   Uruguay region, Santa Catarina state. For this, a floristic-structural
   description of the regenerative component was conducted for different
   size classes and the floristic similarity among classes and adult
   component was verified. Three classes were considered for the
   regenerative component: Class 1, plants from 0.2 up to 1 m high, Class
   2, plants greater than 1 m up to 3 m high, and Class 3, plants greater
   than 3 m high, with cbh < 5.0 cm. Information about the adult component
   for the same sampling units were extract from the database of the
   Dendrology and Phytosociology Laboratory (LABDENRO), of Santa Catarina
   State University. All the regenerative species were classified into
   regeneration guilds (pioneers, light demanding climax, shade tolerant
   climax), based on literature review and on field observations. For the
   whole component and for each size class, the Shannon diversity (H') and
   Pielou Eveness (J) indexes, and the Class (RNC) and Total (RNT) Natural
   Regeneration Indexes were determined. The floristic similarities between
   components were obtained by Sorensen Index. A chi-square applied to a
   contingency table was conducted to verify the existence of association
   between the distribution of individuals belonging to different
   regeneration guilds and size classes. A total of 771 regenerative
   individuals were sampled, belonging to 52 species, whose H' and J were,
   respectively, 3.06 and 0.77. The species with the greatest RNT was
   Nectandra megapotamica (Spreng.) Mez. The similarity with the adult
   component varied between 0.46 for Class 3 and 0.62 for Class 1. In all
   size classes, there was the predominance of individuals of climax light
   demanding species. We conclude that the adult species component was
   mostly represented within the smaller plant size class, where the
   largest proportion of sampled individuals was found.},

Abstract = {The objective of this study was to evaluate the floristic composition,

   harvesting, using the forest management systems in alternate strips
   (SAS) and the selective system (SS). The study was conducted at the
   Forest Management Unit of the MAGELA project, located in the
   municipality of Codo, state of Maranhao. The data were collected in six
   permanent plots of 50 m x 200 m located in the Annual Production Units
   (APU) 1 and 2, in which all trees with a diameter at 1.30 m from the
   ground (DBH) greater than or equal to 15 cm were measured, while trees
   with 5 cm < DBH <15 cm were measured in rectangular subplots of 5 m x 50
   m. Data were collected on two occasions, namely: before (2001) and after
   (2004) the harvest. Species' richness and diversity recovered, and even
   increased, after the application of the SAS and SS systems, but there
   were changes in species composition, as many new species were
   registered, while others were extinct. The community structure was
   extremely affected by the systems, as there were major changes in the
   ranking of the most ecologically important species. In the short term,
   the volume of SAS, after exploration, was greater than that registered
   for the SS, indicating that, probably, the APU submitted to the SS will
   take longer to recover the harvested volume.},

Title = {Impacts of fire on canopy structure and its resilience depend on
   successional stage in Amazonian secondary forests},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING IN ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION},
Year = {2025},
Month = {2025 FEB 15},
Abstract = {Secondary forests in the Amazon are important carbon sinks, biodiversity
   reservoirs, and connections between forest fragments. However, their
   regrowth is highly threatened by fire. Using airborne laser scanning
   (ALS), surveyed between 2016 and 2018, we analyzed canopy metrics in
   burned (fires occurred between 2001 and 2018) and unburned secondary
   forests across different successional stages and their ability to
   recover after fire. We assessed maximum and mean canopy height, openness
   at 5 and 10 m, canopy roughness, leaf area index (LAI) and leaf area
   height volume (LAHV) for 20 sites across South-East Amazonia (ranging
   from 375 to 1200 ha). Compared to unburned forests, burned forests had
   reductions in canopy height, LAI, and LAHV, and increases in openness
   and roughness. These effects were more pronounced in early successional
   (ES) than later successional (LS) stages, for example, mean canopy
   height decreased 33\% in ES and 14\% in LS and LAI decreased 36\% in ES
   and 18\% in LS. Forests in ES stages were less resistant to fire, but
   more resilient (capable of recovering from a disturbance) in their
   post-fire regrowth than LS stage forests. Data extrapolation from our
   models suggests that canopy structure partially recovers with time since
   fire for six out of seven canopy metrics; however, LAI and LAHV in LS
   forests may never fully recover. Our results indicate that successional
   stage-specific management and policies that mitigate against fire in
   early secondary forests should be implemented to increase the success of
   forest regeneration. Mitigation of fires is critical if secondary
   forests are to continue to provide their wide array of ecological
   services.

Abstract = {The conversion of native forests into pastures is still a common
   practice in Brazil. Abandoned pastures have great potential for natural
   regeneration and therefore could play an important role in meeting the
   enormous demand for forest restoration. Few studies, however, have
   investigated the extent to which spatially-structured environmental
   variables and community structure are correlated with the variation in
   species abundance of regenerating forests on abandoned pastures.
   Therefore, we aimed to determine whether environmental and spatial
   variables were capable of explaining the variation in abundance of woody
   species on abandoned pastures in the subtropical Atlantic Forest. We
   systematically distributed 45 sample plots with size and inclusion
   criteria that changed according to the vegetation layer in three
   different abandoned pastures. In general, most of the variation in
   species abundance that our models were able to explain was correlated
   with spatially-unstructured physical-chemical soil properties. A smaller
   part of the variation was correlated with spatially-structured soil
   variables and topography-related variables. An even smaller portion of
   the variation was spatially-structured but was not correlated with
   spatially-structured environmental variables. Therefore, our results
   suggest that the variation in species abundance of regenerating
   subtropical Atlantic forests on abandoned pastures is more closely
   related to niche-based processes mediated by environmental variables
   than to stochastic spatial processes.},

Abstract = {The pressure on rainforests due to fragmentation of natural landscapes
   has caused changes in the substitution pattern of the species present in
   the plant community. In the case of abandoned pastures, there is an
   increased environmental vulnerability to colonization by invasive exotic
   grasses, which represent a barrier to the establishment of native
   plants, since the dispersion and seed germination until the later stages
   of their development. We proposed to discuss some of the processes of
   natural regeneration in pastures, addressing issues that hinder the
   recruitment of desirable woody species and, in this context, the
   exposure of some methodologies based on the concept of nucleation that
   can help this process. Through understanding of the mechanisms involved
   in the maintenance of plant communities, we observed that the seed
   germination and seedling recruitments are crucial steps in the process
   of vegetation restoration. Because only a narrow range of conditions is
   suitable (safe sites) for the recruitment, successful regeneration
   depends on the environment ability to provide an appropriate bed for
   germination (seedbed). The use of methodologies that aimed the natural
   regeneration, to be effective in pasture areas, should be technically
   well established and adequate to the local reality, because although
   they have promising initial results, may no longer be effective over
   time.},

Abstract = {The main objective of this study was to determine the influence of
   environmental heterogeneity on the regenerative component of an Alluvial
   Araucaria Forest in the southern Santa Catarina State plateau region.
   The regenerated individuals were sampled within 48 plots allocated in
   three sectors: river, interior and edge. The survey of environmental
   variables was conducted in all plots, obtaining data of edaphic
   variables, topography, groundwater level, canopy cover, environmental
   impact and soil classification. A Principal Component Analysis was
   performed for the surveyed variables to identify environmental
   gradients. For the regenerative component, the influence of
   environmental sectors, related to river distance and soil classes, on
   floristic-structural organization was determined by generalized linear
   models. The organization of vegetation was verified using Principal
   Coordinates Analysis. The presence of indicator species was evaluated
   for the sectors with significant effect on vegetation. Cambisols
   predominated in the area, and the terrain is mostly flat and the soils
   are dystrophic, acidic, alic and with sandy loam to silt loam texture.
   One third of the plots presented water near the surface, indicating
   greater environmental selectivity in these places. The canopy was
   predominantly closed (91.16\%) and the level of environmental impact was
   considered low. The division into sectors, defined by to the river
   distance, had a significant influence on the distribution pattern of
   species, and the edge sector showed the most distinctive floristic and
   structural composition, with 14 indicator species. The regenerative
   component demonstrated spatial variations that reflected the
   environmental heterogeneity according to sectors, with river distance
   determinant for the formation of floristic groups.},

Abstract = {In this study, we examined the impacts of Attalea oleifera on the
   structure of seedling bank and discuss potential mechanisms of palm
   influence. Seed rain, seedling bank, and palm leaf fall were assessed
   beneath the canopy and in the vicinity of 16 adult palms across the
   edges of a large fragment (3500 ha) of the Atlantic forest. Moreover, we
   examined A. oleifera impacts on seed germination and seedling mortality
   by experimentally submitting seeds and seedlings to prolonged palm-leaf
   covering. As expected, seedling bank beneath the adults exhibited
   reduced abundance and species richness at local and habitat scale. Small
   to large seeds (3.1-30 mm) were underrepresented in the seed rain below
   adults palms, while experimental leaf covering drastically reduced both
   seed germination and seedling survivorship. A. oleifera leaf fall
   occurred over the whole year (3.6 +/- 2.7 leaves/individual/yr), which
   resulted in deep leaf litter mounds (10.7 +/- 9.2 cm). Finally, adult
   palm density (21.6 +/- 11.9 individuals/ha) correlated negatively with
   seedling density across Attalea clusters. Our results suggest that A.
   oleifera exerts negative effects on the seedling bank by reducing
   seedling abundance and richness as a consequence of two complementary
   mechanisms: impoverished and size-biased seed rain plus reduced seed
   germination and increased seedling mortality due to prolonged covering
   by fallen leaves.},

Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {240},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Limited funding is a major barrier to implementing ambitious global
   restoration commitments, so reducing restoration costs is essential to
   upscale restoration. The lack of rigorous analyses about the major
   components and drivers of restoration costs limit the development of
   alternatives to reduce costs and the selection of the most
   cost-effective methods to achieve restoration goals. We conducted
   detailed restoration cost assessments for the three most widespread
   biomes in Brazil (Amazon, Cerrado, and Atlantic Forest) and estimated
   the restoration costs associated with implementing Brazil's National
   Plan for Native Vegetation Recovery (12M hectares). Most surveys
   (60-90\%) reported using the costly methods of planting seedlings or
   sowing seeds throughout the site, regardless of the biome. Natural
   regeneration and assisted regeneration approaches were an order of
   magnitude cheaper but were reported in < 15\% of projects. The vast
   majority of tree planting and direct seeding costs were incurred during
   the implementation phase, and nearly 80\% of projects ended maintenance
   within 30 months. We estimated a price tag of US\$0.7-1.2 billion per
   year until 2030 to implement Brazil's restoration plan depending on the
   area that recovers through natural regeneration. Our results offer
   valuable insights for developing strategies to make restoration cheaper
   and to increase its cost-effectiveness for achieving diverse benefits in
   Brazilian ecosystems. Our survey also provides a starting point for
   sound assessments of restoration costs and their drivers in other
   biomes, which are needed to reduce the financial barriers to scaling up
   restoration at a global scale.},

Abstract = {The low natural regeneration of the Brazil nut (Bertholletia excelsa) in
   the Madre de Dios region of Peru is a major concern for the conservation
   and sustainable use of this species which sustains one of the
   cornerstone non-timber forest product economies in Amazonia. The Brazil
   nut is a gap-dependent, long-lived pioneer species that has been shown
   to regenerate more effectively in fallows than in mature forests. Aside
   from light and nutrient availability, recruitment success of the species
   might also be influenced by conspecific negative distance-dependent
   (CNDD) processes as shown for a myriad of other tropical tree species,
   but to date has not been studied in the Brazil nut. We measured Brazil
   nut recruitment in forty 150 x 10 m(2) transects (totaling 6 ha),
   proportionally laid out in mature forest and fallow land. We found a
   higher likelihood of regeneration in fallows than in mature forest,
   which was mainly due to more successful transitioning from seedlings to
   saplings in fallows. Recruitment rates in fallows increased with the
   number of fire events occurring over the past 12 years, largely owing to
   the accumulation of resprouting individuals, but this positive
   correlation was only observed up to three fire events. We observed CNDD
   recruitment of the Brazil nut in fallows but not in mature forest,
   suggesting that pests and diseases might also condition Brazil nut
   recruitment. Our findings suggest that a better management of fallow
   land and more controlled use of fire in neighboring land uses could be a
   cost-effective manner to create Brazil nut rich forests through natural
   regeneration. On the other hand, the absence of high density Brazil nut
   stands in mature forests in Madre de Dios might mean that the impact of
   ancient humans there has been more limited than in other Amazonian
   regions.},

Abstract = {The Atlantic Forest is reduced to less than 20 \% of its original area,
   but it still protects an important biological heritage. Forest
   fragmentation makes the environment more susceptible to invasive species
   occupation. Jackfruit (Artocarpus heterophyllus) was introduced into
   Brazil in the seventeenth century; and in the second half of the
   twentieth century, its natural regeneration increased the density of
   individuals, compromising the recruitment of many native species. This
   study investigated the impact of A. heterophyllus invasion on the
   diversity and tree structure component at the edge of an Atlantic Forest
   fragment, in Rio de Janeiro (Brazil). Two transect-type plots were set
   up with 10 m x 100 m (1,000 m(2)), being divided into 10 subplots of 10
   m x 10 m, with a total sampling area of 2,000 m2. Trees with a diameter
   at breast height (DBH) equals to or greater than 5 cm were tagged and
   DBH and total height measured. The following phytosociological
   parameters were estimated: Frequency (F), Density (D), Dominance (Do),
   Importance (IV) and Coverage (CV) Values. In total, 191 tree individuals
   were sampled. Invasive species made up more than 35\% of the entire
   vegetation structure in the studied environment, ending in first place
   in terms of Importance Value (IV = 35.62\%). Low floristic wealth seems
   to have favored the A. heterophyllus invasion process in the community,
   showing the need for an effective control of the species for the native
   genetic heritage protection.},

Title = {Distinguishing forest types in restored tropical landscapes with

Journal = {REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {290},
Month = {MAY 15},
Abstract = {Forest landscape restoration is a global priority to mitigate negative
   effects of climate change, conserve biodiversity, and ensure future
   sustainability of forests, with international pledges concentrated in
   tropical forest regions. To hold restoration efforts accountable and
   monitor their outcomes, traditional strategies for monitoring tree cover
   increase by field surveys are falling short, because they are
   labor-intensive and costly. Meanwhile remote sensing approaches have not
   been able to distinguish different forest types that result from
   utilizing different restoration approaches (conservation versus
   production focus). Unoccupied Aerial Vehicles (UAV) with light detection
   and ranging (LiDAR) sensors can observe forests` vertical and horizontal
   structural variation, which has the potential to distinguish forest
   types. In this study, we explored this potential of UAV-borne LiDAR to
   distinguish forest types in landscapes under restoration in southeastern
   Brazil by using a supervised classification method. The study area
   encompassed 150 forest plots with six forest types divided in two forest
   groups: conservation (remnant forests, natural regrowth, and active
   restoration plantings) and production (monoculture, mixed, and abandoned
   plantations) forests. UAV-borne LiDAR data was used to extract several
   Canopy Height Model (CHM), voxel, and point cloud statistic based
   metrics at a high resolution for analysis. Using a random forest
   classification model we could successfully classify conservation and
   production forests (90\% accuracy). Classification of the entire set of
   six types was less accurate (62\%) and the confusion matrix showed a
   divide between conservation and production types. Understory Leaf Area
   Index (LAI) and the variation in vegetation density in the upper half of
   the canopy were the most important classification metrics. In
   particular, LAI understory showed the most variation, and may help
   advance ecological understanding in restoration. The difference in
   classification success underlines the difficulty of distinguishing
   individual forest types that are very similar in management,
   regeneration dynamics, and structure. In a restoration context, we
   showed the ability of UAV-borne LiDAR to identify complex forest
   structures at a plot scale and identify groups and types widely
   distributed across different restored landscapes with medium to high
   accuracy. Future research may explore a fusion of UAV-borne LiDAR with
   optical sensors , include successional stages in the analyses to further
   characterize , distinguish forest types and their contributions to
   landscape restoration.},

Abstract = {This study was conducted in a riparian area of Cerrado (savanna) in
   order to verify if a native plant community is positively or negatively
   influenced by reforestation with a fast growing exotic species (Pinus
   elliottii Engelm), on the basis of the ecological processes involved.
   Four treatments were compared: Pinus trees planted at 3 x 3 m, 3 x 2 m
   and 2 x 2 m, and a control (not planted). Every treatment consisted of
   four replications in randomized blocks and in 16 plots set along the
   stream. Variables related to growth for both planted and native species
   were evaluated, as well as the number of native species regenerating,
   dispersal syndrome, and also the ground cover by grasses. After eleven
   years from the beginning of the experiment, the higher the density of
   Pinus, the higher the density, number of species and diversity of native
   plants regenerating. Therefore the exotic trees facilitated the
   regeneration processes of native species. Analysis of explanatory
   variables showed that such facilitation was due to an indirect effect of
   the shading by Pinus trees, which reduced ground grass cover and
   prevented the inhibitory effect over plant community regeneration and
   growth. Further evaluations to detect competition between Pinus trees
   and the native community would be necessary to check if the facilitation
   effects persist in the long term.},

Abstract = {We compared carbon and nutrient concentrations and stocks in aboveground
   vegetation and soils between secondary forests (10-, 20-, and
   40-year-old stands subject to repeated cycles of slash-and-burn
   agriculture) and a primary forest fragment in the Bragantina region of
   Para, Brazil. We hypothesized that repeated agricultural use would
   result in lower nutrient concentrations and/or stocks in the plant
   tissue and soils of the secondary forest stands relative to the primary
   forest fragment. Yet there were no significant differences in median
   foliar tissue concentrations of C, N, P, K, Ca, or Mg between the
   secondary forests and the primary forest. In woody tissue, the primary
   forest had a lower median Mg concentration (205 mug g(-1)) than all
   secondary forest plots (356-620 mug g(-1)) and a higher median N
   concentration (0.3\%) than the 40-year-old secondary forest (0.2\%).
   Foliar nutrient stocks were higher in the secondary forests than in the
   primary forest due to higher foliar biomass estimates for those plots.
   Aboveground woody nutrient stocks were greatest in the primary forest
   with the exception of Mg. Soil concentrations of exchangeable Ca
   decreased with increasing stand age; soil concentrations of exchangeable
   Mg were higher in all secondary plot soils than in the primary plot
   soil, Labile P stocks were greater in the primary forest soil than in
   all secondary forest soils. Soil labile P stocks were larger than
   aboveground P stocks in the 10- and 20-year-old secondary plots and the
   primary plot and approximately equal to aboveground stocks in the
   40-year-old plot. Relative to other tropical and temperate locations,
   nutrient capital at these sites is low in both the vegetation and the
   soil, but a century of shifting cultivation does not yet appear to have
   introduced soil nutrient limitations to forest regrowth. (C) 2001

Abstract = {Family farmers in the Northeast of Para have, traditionally, developed
   forest recovery practices in their lots, and more recently have been
   adapting them. This research aimed to characterize the types of forest
   recovery, analyzing the existence of relationships between the types

   Therefore, the research was based on principles of interdisciplinarity
   and the systemic approach, and thus carried out a survey of sixty
   experiments in four Municipalities of the Northeastern Mesoregion of
   Para, Brazil. From the realization of a typology of the forest recovery
   the peculiarities of these experiences were understood, highlighting the
   main perceptions and motivations of the farmers. Thus, five main types
   of forest recovery practiced in the Region were found: Natural
   regeneration, Agroforestry backyard and the three types of agroforestry
   systems (Lowly diversified, Diversified and Highly diversified). It was
   concluded, therefore, that there is a framework of forest recovery in
   Northeastern Para, inspired by new socioenvironmental perceptions and
   motivations of different orders. This movement of forest recovery seems
   to point a new productive path to the Eastern Amazon.},

Abstract = {The knowledge of soil seeds bank provides essential information on the
   potential of regeneration in a particular areas, allowing inferences on
   its restoration. By using 20 plots with 25 x 25 cm and 5 cm deep,
   samples of soils from different environmental situations, identified in
   a rural property in Caranda, MG, were collected (clean pasture, dirty
   pasture, coppice, eucalyptus and forest). The collected material was put
   to be germinated in a greenhouse and analyzed for eight months, where
   composition and the density of the species (herbaceous, sub-shrubby,
   shrubby and arboreal) were evaluated. The environmental situations
   presented different expressions of natural regeneration. The dirty
   pasture was the situation that presented the largest number of
   regenerating herbaceous trees, what makes it more problematic for forest
   restoration. All the environmental situations presented bank of seeds of
   arboreal and shrubby seedlings, which may help the restoration process.
   However, the success of this activity will be directly linked to the
   activities of competitor control, mainly of Urochloa decumbens (Stapf)
   R. D. Webster, an aggressive grass that germinates in every
   environmental situation. Due to the absence of species in final
   succession stage in the seed bank in the soil, there might have been
   other complementary interventions such as planting of seedlings, direct
   sowing of tree species and/or implantation of artificial galleries to
   accelerate the vegetable succession.},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {The Seasonally Dry Tropical Forests (SDTF), distributed from Mexico to
   northern Argentina, are habitat to a unique biodiversity. Among these
   forests, the Caatinga stands out, occupying a large part of the
   Brazilian Northeast and is subject to cycles of anthropic disturbance
   and abandonment of exploited areas. Understanding how microbial
   communities respond to environmental changes is crucial, especially
   considering the various ecosystem services provided by microorganisms.
   Among soil microorganisms, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) play a
   significant role in the maintenance of terrestrial ecosystems. In this
   study, we aimed to evaluate the structure, composition, and distribution
   of AMF assemblages, as well as their main drivers, in regeneration areas
   of the Caatinga. Soil samples were collected in the Catimbau National
   Park (Pernambuco State), including an oldgrowth forest representing
   undisturbed areas, and in early, intermediate, and late regeneration
   areas. The composition of AMF assemblages differed among regenerating
   areas and old-growth forest, but their distribution is not related and
   conditioned to plant assemblages. Instead, soil properties and rainfall
   are the main factors structuring these assemblages in SDTF. A total of
   83 taxa of AMF were identified. Glomus and Acaulospora, which exhibit
   respectively ruderal and stress-tolerant life strategies were the most
   abundant genera. The highest number of unique AMF species was recorded
   in the old-growth forest, contrasting with the late regeneration areas
   which had the lowest number. The results showed that deterministic
   processes (soil and rainfall) are structuring the AMF assemblages in
   areas under regeneration process in SDTF. Plants and AMF do not recover
   simultaneously over the evaluated regeneration times.},

Abstract = {Land-use change in tropical forests can affect the micro-environment for
   decomposition under modified canopies. In turn, decomposition may have
   consequences for soil fertility and ecosystem sustainability. The
   effects of the conversion from primary forest to pastures on leaf-litter
   decomposition and its recovery in secondary forests 20 y after pasture
   abandonment were evaluated using litterbags and a general mixed model
   approach. Litterbags containing leaf-litter of two contrasting qualities
   were placed in those three ecosystems and the mass remaining after 90 d
   was quantified. The mass remaining was 50\% lower in high-than in
   low-quality leaves. The effects of the decomposition environment
   depended on the substrate quality. Although differences among ecosystems
   were not significant for low-quality leaves, high-quality leaves
   decomposed more slowly in pastures than in forests (mean dry mass
   remaining was 38\% in pastures, 14\% in secondary and 12\% in primary
   forest). The decomposition of common substrates did not differ among
   forests. Results show that the conversion of primary forest to pasture
   may produce conditions for slower decomposition; however, these
   conditions appear be restored to a great extent in 20-y-old secondary
   forests.},

Abstract = {We present a review of more than 30 years of ecological restoration in
   the Brazilian part of the Atlantic Forest. Based on what has been done
   in this biome, we try to summarize the main findings and challenges for
   restoration in this highly threatened forest biome. We found that many
   past experiences did not result in self-perpetuating forests, for
   different reasons. Currently, most projects aim to construct
   self-sustaining communities and no longer see restoration as a
   deterministic process. We also found that the reconstruction of
   permanent forest with high diversity is feasible but it depends on the
   strategies applied and on the surrounding landscape. Although many new
   techniques have been created (e.g. seed rain management or promotion of
   natural regeneration), the most used one in the Atlantic Forest is still
   the planting of many native species from different functional groups.
   Native species are largely used and perform well even in highly
   disturbed environments. Today, many projects are trying to produce
   thousands of hectares of permanent forests and many technical advances
   are about to be incorporated. But restoration also faces some main
   challenges to become an effective and widespread means of conserving the
   Atlantic Forest which are, namely, reducing costs, planning restoration
   actions at landscape-level. and conforming to socio-political issues.
   The socio-political tools to overcome such barriers in practice have yet
   to be developed. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Journal = {LAND USE POLICY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {130},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Most of Brazilian's remaining native vegetation occurs inside private
   properties. Therefore, the effectiveness of environmental policies is
   affected by landowner's decisions. Brazilian Native Vegetation
   Protection Law delimits riparian permanent preservation areas (RPA)
   defined according to stream and river widths. Restoration legal needs
   (the environmental debt or liability) can increase native cover in
   Brazil. However, costly ecological restoration may prevent small owners
   from doing that. For that matter, it is important to understand and know
   the socioeconomic variables behind the restoration debt in certain areas
   in Brazil. Thus, we aimed at analyzing distribution of environmental
   debt in these RPA and related it to the socio- economic condition of the
   municipalities. We found that most of Sao Paulo state has environmental
   debt within its RPA. High environmental debt in Sao Paulo state is
   associated with the agricultural sector. Some of these regions are
   wealth and restoration by total planting might be well applied for
   compliance with legislation. In other places, where environmental debt
   and poverty are high, assisted natural regeneration might be an
   efficient technique, along with agroforestry systems. Some regions where
   low environmental debt coincided with poverty, environmental
   compensation could play an important role in a policy mix for socially
   equitable conservation and restoration.},

Title = {Restoring tropical forests on lands mined for bauxite: Examples from the

Abstract = {Restoring self-sustaining tropical forest ecosystems on surface mined
   sites is a formidable challenge that requires the integration of proven
   reclamation techniques and reforestation strategies appropriate to
   specific site conditions, including landscape biodiversity patterns.
   Restorationists working in most tropical settings are usually hampered
   by lack of basic information on the wide variety of native tree species
   that characterize the pre-disturbance forests, as well as insufficient
   understanding of the ecology of disturbance and natural recovery to
   design effective restoration programs. A notable exception to this is
   the forest restoration program developed since the early 1980s by a
   Brazilian bauxite mining company operating at Trombetas in Para State in
   central Amazonia. A systematic nursery and field research strategy was
   used to develop a reforestation program based on mixed plantings of mon
   than 70 native old-growth forest tree species. This technique has been
   used to replant about 100 ha of deforested minelands each year over the
   past 15 years. Research in recent years has evaluated this approach and
   other, generally simpler, reforestation methods used at a smaller scale
   at this site. Post-plantation biodiversity development and other
   indicators of restoration success or sustainability were recorded. The
   results of these studies have shown the overwhelming importance of
   careful site preparation and topsoil handling/replacement practices in
   determining both future productivity and biodiversity of the
   redeveloping forests, irrespective of the complexity of the planting
   design used. The inclusion of a wide variety of forest species,
   particularly later successional species, was very important for
   long-range restoration owing to limitations on natural recovery
   processes that inhibit seed dispersal and subsequent colonization of
   many old-growth forest species. Many of the: lessons learned at this
   site an applicable to improve the design of mineland rehabilitation and
   forest restoration programs worldwide. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

Volume = {325},
Month = {NOV 20},
Abstract = {Commercial forestry activities featuring heavy machinery and intensive
   traffic represent one of the most common degradation processes in
   infertile Tropical soils. This research aimed to evaluate the potential
   of sewage sludge (SS) as pedotechnomaterial (PTM) for soil recovery in
   strongly degraded Entisols with a human-induced, highly compacted densic
   horizon (A(d)). The area was used as a lumber deposit and for related
   forestry activities for more than ten consecutive years. Soil recovery
   activities consisted of: i) SS increasing dose applications (2.5, 5.0,
   10.0, 15.0, and 20.0 Mg ha(-1)) in the surface mineral horizon, vs a
   control; and, ii) pioneer (Pn), secondary (Se), and climax (Cx) native
   species plantation. Pioneer, Sc, and Cx were characterized by an
   increasing H and D trend as time went by, with Pn (H and D) > Sc > Cx.
   After three years, the highest SS dose (20 Mg ha(-1)) provided the best
   performance in most investigated species. Soil treated with the highest
   SS dose showed increased SOM, total P, CEC, exchangeable Ca, total Fe,
   Mn, Cu, and Zn contents after 36 months. No soil nutrient deficiency,
   potentially toxic elements (PTE) soil pollution, or related hazards were
   observed. The principal factor analysis showed that SS positively
   effects soil-plant feedbacks and related behavior. Canonical
   correspondence analysis explained how soil physical-chemical parameters
   influenced the whole plant ecological succession over time: i) during
   the early stage of development, Pn and Sc species were mainly affected
   by soil pH (SS buffering effect); ii) after one year, Ca, Mn, and CEC
   strongly influenced D development of mainly Sc species, thus further
   developing the whole soil-plant system; iii) at the end of the
   experiment, SOM and several soil macro- and micronutrients greatly
   influenced more demanding Cx species. For the first time, this research
   demonstrated the SS efficiency as PTM in strongly degraded Tropical
   soils; a PTM strongly favoring soil and forest restoration.},

Abstract = {The litter quality can alter soil aggregation, modifying the
   transformation dynamics and allocation of soil carbon (C) in different
   compartments. This study evaluated the aggregate stability and its
   relation with litter chemical characteristics, organic carbon and free
   light fraction (FLL) from the organic matter under three different types
   of vegetation covering: secondary forest (FS) and plantings of Mimosa
   Caesalpiniaefolia (PM) and Carapa guianenses (PA) with subsequently
   natural regeneration. Litter samples were characterized using
   polyfenols, lignin, suberine, tannin and holocelulose content and ON
   relationship. Soil samples were collected in two depths (0-10 and 10-20
   cm) and soil aggregation were estimate using mean weight diameter (DMP),
   mean geometric diameter (DMG) and index of aggregate stability (IPA)
   analysis. Soil samples in the same depths were also characterized using
   C and FLL content. The highest suberine and polyfenols content of the
   litter found in the areas FS and PM reduced the speed of residues
   decomposition in the soil causing larger FLL content in both coverings.
   Those compositions contributed to the stabilization of C in the mineral
   phase, because the highest C content was found in those areas. This fact
   is confirmed by the values of DMP, DMG and IEA among the areas. They are
   higher in the coverings, PM and FS. It can be concluded that the
   polyfenols and suberine content were decisive in the subdivision of C
   and in the aggregation of the soil in the areas of FS and PM.},

Abstract = {Over the past three decades, large expanses of forest in the Amazon
   Basin were converted to pasture, many of which later degraded to woody
   fallows and were abandoned. While the majority of tropical secondary
   forest (SF) Studies have examined post-deforestation or
   post-agricultural succession, we examined post-pasture forest recovery
   in 10 forests ranging in age from 0 to 14 years since abandonment. We
   measured aboveground biomass and soil nutrients to 45 cm depth and
   computed total site carbon (C) and nutrient stocks to gain an
   understanding of the dynamics of nutrient and C buildup in regenerating
   SF in central Amazonia.
   Aboveground biomass accrual was rapid, 11.0 Mg(.)ha(-1.)yr(-1), in the
   young SFs. Within 12-14 yr, they accumulated up to 128.1 Mg/ha of dry
   aboveground biomass, equivalent to 25-50\% of primary forest biomass in
   the region. Wood nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) concentrations
   decreased with forest age. Aboveground P and calcium (Ca) stocks
   accumulated at a rate of 1.2 and 29.4 kg(.)ha(-1.)yr(-1); extractable
   soil P stocks declined as forest age increased. Although soil stocks of
   exchangeable Ca (207.0 +/- 23.7 kg/ha) and-extractable P (8.3 +/- 1.5
   kg/ha) were low in the first 45 cm, both were rapidly translocated from
   soil to plant pools. Soil N stocks increased with forest age, probably
   due to N fixation, atmospheric deposition, and/or subsoil mining. Total
   soil C storage to 45 cm depth ranged between 42 and 84 Mg/ha, with the
   first 15 cm storing 40-45\% of the total.
   Total C accrual (7.04 Mg C(.)ha(-1.)yr(-1)) in both aboveground and soil
   pools was similar or higher than values reported in other studies.
   Tropical SFs,regrowing on lightly to moderately used pasture rapidly
   sequester C and rebuild total nutrient capital following pasture
   abandonment. Translocation of some nutrients from deep soil (>45 cm
   depth) may be important to sustaining productivity and continuing
   biomass accumulation in these forests. The soil pool represents the
   greatest potential for long-term C gains; however, soil nutrient
   deficits may limit future productivity.},

Title = {Glass Half-Full or Half-Empty? A Fire-Resistant Species Triggers
   Divergent Regeneration in Low-Resilience Pastures},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN FORESTS AND GLOBAL CHANGE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {3},
Month = {OCT 22},
Abstract = {Fire may divert or arrest natural regeneration in abandoned pastures
   throughout the tropics, transforming them to low-resilience systems that
   do not recover even in the absence of disturbances. Understanding
   regeneration in degraded landscapes is crucial to decision-making and
   predicting the outcome of passive or active restoration actions. We
   aimed to understand the effects of intensifying fire regimes on
   post-fire natural regeneration in sites degraded by logging and fire in
   the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. We studied five areas with different fire
   regimes (i.e., different fire frequencies and post-fire regeneration
   time), dominated by Moquiniastrum polymorphum (Asteraceae), a
   widely-distributed species with fire resistance traits. We analyzed
   differences in structure, diversity, the amplitude of the species'
   geographic distribution, and floristic composition. We recorded Leaf
   Area Index and grass cover to understand the effect of canopy closure on
   fire exclusion and analyzed functional traits related to succession and
   response to fire (specific leaf area, height, wood density, bark
   thickness, seed mass). Post-fire regeneration was slow and fire-prone
   and dominance by M. polymorphum decreased with less disturbance, as
   other species entered the communities. Structure, diversity, and
   functional composition recovered along the gradient but did not reach
   old-growth values. The taxonomic composition was strikingly different in
   burned areas and forests, irrespective of fire history. Natural
   regeneration followed a divergent trajectory, marked by the
   establishment of other widely-distributed species, which suggests a
   long-term floristic impoverishment. The establishment of M. polymorphum
   allows these pastures to exit grass-fire cycles. Longer post-fire
   recovery and fewer fire events allow for canopy closure, grass
   exclusion, and eventually fire suppression. This two-step dynamic breaks
   a crucial barrier for restoration from degraded pastures and represents
   a more desirable state than pastures. However, relying only upon natural
   regeneration results in impoverished secondary forests. Given the
   pervasive effects of deforestation and fire, natural regeneration
   observed in tropical landscapes may correspond to impoverished new
   secondary forests that fail to attain conservation targets for the
   biome. Preventing future fires and controlling grass cover in the
   understory is crucial to avoid their retrogression to pastures and to
   treat them as regeneration templates for active restoration.},

Abstract = {Restoring forest ecosystems to reverse soil degradation is critical to
   maintain environmental quality, forest and agricultural productivity,
   biodiversity conservation, and to provide valuable ecosystem services.
   Yet the impacts of forest restoration on soil quality remain
   under-investigated. Here we aim to address a key knowledge gap: how does
   forest ecosystem restoration affect the recovery of soil quality in
   tropical and temperate regions? We conducted a global meta-analysis to
   compare soil physical, chemical, and biological properties between
   restoring forests and reference old-growth/less-disturbed forests. We
   revealed for the first time that differences between restoring and
   reference forests are lower for physical (12-25\%; based on median
   values of effect size) and chemical (10-74\%) properties than for
   biological (32-90\%) properties. More specifically, bulk density (12\%
   of difference), pH (10\%), and enzyme activity (32\%) had mean values in
   restoring forests closer to those observed in reference forests.
   Overall, our results suggest that the restoration of soil properties was
   greater in tropical regions, after longer periods (>30 years), through
   passive restoration, and over pasturelands. Our global meta-analysis
   helps to fill the soil information gap in forest restoration and
   increase our understanding of how to improve soil quality through forest
   restoration and soil monitoring processes in tropical and temperate
   regions.},

   are Myrsine umbellata Mart. and Sorocea bonplandii (Baill.) W. C.
   Burger. In the natural regeneration the 10 first species accumulated
   54\% of the total natural regeneration, with rates from 13.5\% to 0.2\%.
   The high observed richness showed the contribution of ``Porta de
   Torres{''} as an important Atlantic species migratory corridor in the
   vegetation in Rio Grande do Sul, adding new information on Restinga
   community structure and floristic in Rio Grande do Sul. The results will
   contribute to further studies on PEVA dynamic and to environmental

Abstract = {Abandoned pastures are increasingly targeted for forest restoration in
   the neotropics. However, the dominance of such areas by fodder grasses
   imposes a challenge for efficient and low cost control. Therefore, we
   questioned whether alien and native grasses equally affect: (1) natural
   regeneration; (2) natural regeneration under artificial perches; and (3)
   planted seedling development. Our study was carried out in an abandoned
   pasture in southeastern Brazil, in the Atlantic Forest biome. For (1) we
   installed plots in grass patches of Melinis minutiflora (molasse grass,
   an alien grass) and Imperata brasiliensis (satintail, a native grass
   that occurs in degraded areas); for (2) we installed plots under perches
   in alien and native grass patches; and for (3) we compared overall
   planted seedling mortality and development of four tree species in alien
   and native grass patches. Density and diversity of woody species in
   natural regeneration and under perches were similar for invasive and
   native grass patches. However, species composition differed between
   alien and native grass patches (Ellenberg similarity of 28\% for perches
   and 35\% for natural regeneration in different grass patches). Seedling
   mortality was similar for both alien and native grasses. Except for two
   tree species, development was similar for both native and alien grass
   patches. Our results indicate that the biological barriers imposed by a
   given grass species for forest succession and restoration must not be
   estimated based only on the species' origin.},

Abstract = {Knowledge about litterfall and its nutrient fluxes is important for
   understanding ecosystem dynamics, especially in regards to vegetation at
   different succession stages. Regenerating vegetation represents a large
   proportion of tropical forests, such as the caatinga dry forest in NE
   Brazil, which is heavily used for fuel wood and slash-and-burn
   agriculture. In the present study we measured litterfall for 2 years in
   four regeneration stages of caatinga: recently abandoned pasture, 15-,
   37-, and 57-years (mature caatinga) of regeneration. The lowest litter C
   fluxes were observed in pasture sites but the highest fluxes occurred in
   the intermediate regeneration stages (15 and 37 years of regeneration)
   than in the mature caatinga. The 15-year site had the highest
   concentrations and the greatest fluxes of nitrogen and phosphorus.
   Nutrient concentrations in litter were in the range of those found in
   other dry forests, but the fluxes were lower. The high N:P concentration
   ratios indicate that P is a limiting nutrient in this ecosystem. The
   proportion of total litterfall C fluxes relative to total C stocks in
   the ecosystem decreased consistently with succession age, but annual net
   C accumulation in the ecosystem increased with succession age. The
   results suggest that litterfall in earlier regeneration stages is more
   strongly affected by rainfall variation than mature vegetation, but
   these patterns need to be further investigated for longer periods. This
   higher stability of mature ecosystems could be important in face of the
   expected higher climatic variability in the future.},

Journal = {BIOTROPICA},

Abstract = {Ants are diverse and ecologically important organisms in tropical
   forests, where their spatiotemporal distribution can be highly complex.
   This complexity arises mainly from marked differences in microclimatic
   conditions and resource availability through space and time that is even
   more evident in highly seasonal environments, such as tropical dry
   forests. However, it is unclear how seasonality interacts with other
   factors that might shape temporal variation of ant composition
   (beta-diversity), like vertical strata and habitat disturbance. Our goal
   was to examine the potential influence of vertical stratification and
   the successional stage on the spatiotemporal variation of a tropical dry
   forest's ant species composition. We assessed whether species turnover
   or nestedness was the main component determining the spatiotemporal
   beta-diversity of ant communities across the canopy and litter strata.
   We sampled canopy and litter ants in ten plots, half in the early and
   half on the late stage of secondary succession at four times, twice in
   wet and twice in dry season. A high species turnover defined the
   spatiotemporal beta-diversity of canopy and litter ant communities
   across years and seasons in our focal dry forests. Importantly, the
   temporal ant species composition was much more stable in the canopy than
   in the litter. Moreover, we found that the ant community's temporal
   dynamics was consistently high across successional stages, not differing
   in the temporal beta-diversity between early and late succession. Our
   results provide valuable insights into the potential underlying causes
   of community assembly and spatiotemporal dynamics in seasonal habitats,
   like the highly threatened and diverse tropical dry forests.

Volume = {25},
Number = {4},
Abstract = {The objective was to evaluate the influence of fire in a forest fragment
   through litter biomass analysis, regeneration of Cecropia sp., and
   canopy openness. Two treatments were established, one of them
   corresponding to an area affected by fire (Ti) and the other not
   affected by fire (T2), both areas encompassing 0.3 ha of forest. Samples
   were collected in 20 different sites in each treatment, weighed and
   placed in an oven at 70 degrees C to constant weight. To quantify
   Cecropia sp. regeneration a census was performed in both areas.
   Hemispheric images collected at 5 different points in each area were
   used to analyze canopy openness. Data were analyzed through analysis of
   variance (ANOVA) and a significant difference between treatments was
   detected. The area affected by fire had higher canopy openness, greater
   amount of Cecropia sp., and lower litter biomass when compared with the
   area that was not affected by fire. This indicates that fire interfered
   with the structure and composition of the burned forest.},

Abstract = {The objective of this study was to evaluate qualitative and

   Eucalyptus robusta plantation and three reforestation areas with native
   species, located in a riparian area of Mogi-Guacu River floodplain, in
   Luiz Antonio County (21 degrees 31'S and 47 degrees 55'W), Sao Paulo
   State, Brazil. The evaluation was carried out in 12 plots of 10 x 10 m
   systematically distributed in each area. Four subplots of 0.5 m x 0.5 m
   were randomly distributed in each plot. Two subplots were used to
   evaluate the seed bank in the litter and two in the soil sample at the 0
   - 5 cm depth. The sampling was accomplished in September 2001 in the
   natural forest remainders and in the eucalyptus plantation and, in
   September 2002, in the reforested areas. The soil and the litter were
   conditioned in plastic pots, and incubated with periodic irrigations for
   the seed germination during seven months, in two greenhouse environment
   conditions: one at 100\% sunlight and the other, under a screen that
   provides a 70\% sunlight reduction. In the composition of all sample
   area seed banks, there was a predomination of pioneer species at the
   early successional stages. The most important arboreal species were
   Aloysia virgata and Cecropia hololeuca. The reforestation with native
   species provided a seed bank with a greater diversity of native arboreal
   species than the eucalyptus plantation. The present study indicates that
   the similarity between the planted and natural forest should be enhanced

Abstract = {Throughout Brazilian Amazonia anthropogenic soils that are the product
   of pre-Columbian settlements are called Terra Preta de Aindio (Indian
   Dark Earths, TPI). These soils are dramatically different from
   surrounding soils due to long-term human activity, but there is little
   information about how secondary forest succession is affected by these
   differences. We tested if community structure (density, richness and
   basal area), floristic composition and domesticated species' richness
   and density were similar between TPI and non-anthropogenic soils (NAS)
   in 52 25 x 10 m secondary forest plots in different successional stages
   near three traditional communities along the middle Madeira River,
   Central Amazonia. We sampled 858 woody individuals on TPI (77
   domesticated) and 1095 on NAS (27 domesticated); 550 understory palms on
   TPI (169 domesticated) and 778 on NAS (123 domesticated). We found 179
   species on TPI (10 domesticated), 190 on NAS (8 domesticated), and 74
   (25\%) in both environments. Although community structure on TPI and NAS
   was fairly similar, they showed significantly distinctive floristic
   compositions, both for woody individuals and understory palms. The
   density and richness of domesticated species was significantly higher on
   TPI than on NAS for woody individuals, but not for palms. The intimate
   long-term association of TPI with human activity has lead to the
   formation of distinct secondary forests and has favored the
   concentration of domesticated populations of crop species. Hence,
   secondary forests on anthropogenic soils concentrate agrobiodiversity,
   offering advantages for in situ conservation of genetic resources, and
   are unique ecosystems that should be considered in conservation efforts.},

Abstract = {This study analyzes the Amazon rainforest in the Brazilian state of
   Rondonia from the perspective of the forest regeneration observed from
   2008 to 2018. The research examines the regeneration's contribution to
   the landscape's morphological spatial pattern within the state's
   geographical limits, conservation units, indigenous lands, and the
   unprotected region. It assesses how the increase of forest regeneration
   areas influences morphological spatial patterns and evaluates whether
   the landscape in Rondonia has benefited from these new areas. The
   GuidosToolbox software was used to extract the morphological spatial
   pattern and the indices of morphological spatial patterns of forest
   habitats. The findings showed that Rondonia developed forest
   regeneration areas for 10 years, but these areas contributed little to
   improving the landscape morphological spatial patterns. The increase in
   regeneration areas contributed adequately only in the unprotected
   region. Therefore, the forest regeneration was not enough to compensate
   for the observed deforestation. Thus, conservation actions must be
   complemented with restoration activities focused on reconnecting patches
   and increasing the size of forest habitat through projects to encourage
   environmental regularization of exploited areas. Study Implications: The
   state of Rondonia reflects what is happening in the Brazilian Amazon,
   with high levels of deforestation and forest regeneration in abandoned
   areas after anthropic use. The emergence of new forest areas contributes
   to reducing the effects of anthropization on forest habitat fragments.
   However, forest regeneration alone is insufficient to ensure that the
   landscape has substantially recovered. In-depth analyses, such as
   morphological spatial pattern analysis, can provide a broader view to
   affirm that regenerated forest areas are growing in a region while
   enriching forest habitat fragments and resulting in ecological benefits.},

Title = {Woody species richness drives synergistic recovery of socio-ecological
   multifunctionality along early tropical dry forest regeneration},
Journal = {FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {482},
Month = {FEB 15},
Abstract = {Secondary tropical forests offer critical ecosystem services such as
   regulation of climate, soil and water resources, which are frequently
   traded off against the provision of forest products for human use or
   repeated clearing for agriculture. While some evidence also suggests
   potential synergies between regulating and material contributions of
   regenerating forests to people, the ecological mechanisms of multiple
   synergies remain poorly understood. We assess tradeoffs and synergies by
   testing for cascading effects of tropical dry forest age and vegetation
   drivers on key ecosystem properties that underpin multiple regulating,
   material and non-material contributions to people. To do so we first
   compiled published evidence to propose a conceptual framework of the
   causal dependence among variables. Then, we tested which direct or
   indirect effects of this a priori conceptual model are supported by
   structural equation models of measured data from a chronosequence of
   secondary tropical dry forest plots. We tested whether individual
   density, taxonomic or functional diversity, community-weighted mean in
   wood specific gravity, or composition of the woody vegetation best
   explained synergies or tradeoffs among multiple key ecosystem
   properties. We show a synergistic, positive effect of observed woody
   species richness on all four key ecosystem properties, including total
   basal area, litter layer carbon stocks, soil penetration resistance and
   availability and versatility of socioeconomically useful plants. A
   similar synergistic effect of linear age-dependent changes in species
   composition suggests that the simultaneous recovery of multiple
   functions is not only driven by absolute woody species accrual, but also
   by temporal woody species turnover as secondary succession proceeds.
   However, local farmers reported uses of only a small fraction of
   available plant biodiversity that has previously been documented in the
   literature to be socioeconomically useful. In synthesis, we found that
   observed woody species richness and successional turnover along tropical
   dry forest regeneration are synergistic drivers of biodiversity,
   ecosystem functioning and the availability and versatility of currently
   underutilized plant products in Western Mexico. Such observed synergy
   between a range of key regulating, material and non-material
   contributions to people highlights untapped socioecological potential
   for multifunctional tropical forest restoration through sustainable use.},

Abstract = {Araucaria forest (AF) is one of the most devastated vegetation types in
   the Atlantic Forest, with a high percentage of areas to be restored. The
   purpose of this study was to compare two planting models in areas of AF
   and to determine functional attributes of four native species for
   ecological restoration - Schinus terebinthifolius, Psidium cattleianum,
   Eugenia involucrata, and Ocotea odorifera. The study compared the
   survival, initial growth, canopy cover, and ground cover throughout 18
   months between systematic planting models (pioneer species interspaced
   with non-pioneer species in the same planting row) and random models
   (pioneer and non-pioneer species randomly distributed within the plots).
   The functional attributes assessed were average height growth, survival,
   susceptibility to frost, canopy diameter, and frequency of herbivory.
   There were no differences in survival, initial growth, and canopy cover
   of plants between the planting models. Schinus terebinthifolius
   presented 87\% of the desirable attributes to use in restoration
   projects in AF with high rates of survival and growth (height growth and
   canopy diameter). The non-pioneer species had a survival rate of 50\% or
   lower and are not recommended for joint planting with the pioneer
   species for implementation during the frost season in AF.},

Abstract = {The soil organic matter content is severely affected by soil use and
   management. In physically and chemically fragile soils the destruction
   of native vegetation can cause a great decrease in the carbon stock.
   However, soils that present high resilience, when appropriately handled,
   can easily recover the original values of carbon. The objective of this
   research was to quantify and analyze organic carbon of young soils in
   relation to their use, especially those in natural regeneration. Samples
   of two layers were collected (0-5 and 5-15 cm) in two soils (Neossolo
   and Chernossolo) that occur in a headslope watershed, with four use
   conditions (forest, new farming, old farming and regeneration). Particle
   size distribution, soil bulk density and organic carbon were evaluated.
   The data were submitted to statistical analysis considering a completely
   randomized design, in tri-factorial outline (soil types, uses and
   sampled layers). The soil carbon stock decreased with deforestation for
   annual plantation of crops with little addition of residues and
   intensive soil turbation. The natural regeneration of degraded soils by
   conventional tillage recovered the soil carbon stock quickly, even when
   there remained impressions from erosion (lower clay) and from the
   application of fertilizers and correctives (lower potential acidity and
   larger phosphorus and potassium availability).},

Abstract = {The process of natural regeneration in an area degraded for the
   construction of the Camargos hydroelectric plant dam, MG, was analyzed
   155 months after the planting for its reclamation. The analyses were

   distance of the seed sources. The survey of the natural regeneration was
   done in plots of 2 x 15m allocated every 10m along three transects (15m
   width and variable length) parallel to the slope direction. All plants
   with DBH < 5cm and height > 10cm were identified and measured in height.
   Sixty four species of 27 families were found. The adjacent fragment
   provides a great amount of propagules for the natural regeneration,
   since many regenerative species in the recovering area were found only
   in the arboreal stratum of that fragment. A distance of up to 75m to the
   fragment did not affect the regeneration density, height and diversity,
   but in the plots taken by the grass Mellinis minutiflora, the density
   was smaller and the plants higher.},

   structures in moist tropical regions often create difficulties in
   accurately classifying land-use and land-cover (LULC) features. This
   paper examines the value of spectral mixture analysis (SMA) using
   Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) data for improving LULC classification
   accuracy in a moist tropical area in Rondonia, Brazil. Different
   routines, such as constrained and unconstrained least-squares solutions,
   different numbers of endmembers, and minimum noise fraction
   transformation, were examined while implementing the SMA approach. A
   maximum likelihood classifier was also used to classify fraction images
   into seven LULC classes: mature forest, intermediate secondary
   succession, initial secondary succession, pasture, agricultural land,
   water, and bare land. The results of this study indicate that reducing
   correlation between image bands and using four endmembers improve
   classification accuracy. The overall classification accuracy was 86.6\%
   for the seven LULC classes using the best SMA processing routine, which
   represents very good results for such a complex environment. The overall
   classification accuracy using a maximum likelihood approach was 81.4\%.
   Another finding is that use of constrained or unconstrained solutions
   for unmixing the atmospherically corrected or raw Landsat TM images does
   not have significant influence on LULC classification performances when
   image endmembers are used in a SMA approach.},

Abstract = {Bamboo grove may cause changes in the structure and floristic
   composition of natural regeneration. This study evaluated the impact
   caused by Bambusa tuldoides Munro at natural regeneration, in riparian
   forest in Rio Grande do Sul, south of Brazil. Two areas were evaluated:
   riparian forest without bamboos (SB) as the reference area, and riparian
   forest dominated by Bambusa tuldoides (CB). In 2014, ten plots (10x10 m)
   were installed in each area. All individuals belonging to classes I (30
   <= H < 130 cm) and II ( CBH <= 5 cm) were measured and identified.
   Floristic composition, phytosociological indexes, Shannon diversity
   index, Margalef richness, Simpson dominance, Sorensen similarity, and
   cluster analysis by Twinspan were evaluated. Richness and absolute
   density decreased in CB compared to SB. The areas presented low
   floristic similarity, and high dominance of one or more species in both
   classes. Myrtaceae was the predominant botanic family in SB, especially
   Campomanesia xanthocarpa. In CB most species were secondary, as Myrsine
   umbellata, Cupania vernalis, and Ocotea puberula. Due to the large
   differences between SB and CB, the groups formed were restricted mostly
   to the species of each area. Species such as Myrsine umbellata (class I
   and II) and Strichnos brasiliensis (class II) appear as indicators and
   former of groups in CB. We concluded that high density of Bambusa
   tuldoides affect the richness and diversity of regeneration natural,
   changing the establishment and perpetuation of the species. Secondary
   species show greater potential for adaptation to these environments and
   can act as key species in management and recovery actions.},

   more intense in lower and greater insolation slopes (toward north).},

Abstract = {This study aimed to identify priority areas for the passive restoration
   of the Arauai river basin, municipality of Moju, Para, using a
   multicriteria model. This basin is located in a region with intense land
   use dynamics and expansion of oil palm cultivation, and with high forest
   loss and fragmentation. The Weighted Linear Combination method was used,
   with the aggregation of five criteria (Natural Erosion Vulnerability,
   Potential Land Use and Cover to Passive Restoration, Proximity to the
   Primary Forest, Forest cover deficit in PPAs, and Distance from Roads
   and Highways). This analysis allowed to evaluate different biophysical
   classes and types of land use that affect the selection of areas for
   restoration. A total of 207.82 km(2) of priority areas for passive
   restoration were identified in the studied basin, with about 80\% of its
   priority areas having medium to very high priority. The final map
   generated proved to be a useful instrument in the environmental
   management of restoration plans in the Amazon watershed.},

Abstract = {The mountainous environments of the semiarid region of Brazil are, for
   the most part, shown as environments of conserved vegetation cover or in
   an advanced ecological succession stage, which gives them greater
   floristic and structural diversity. Given the context of phytogeographic
   complexity in which these environments are associated, this research
   aimed to classify the phytoecological units of the Joao do Vale mountain
   range (RN/PB). The classification of land uses and land cover was
   carried out with the aid of the Ecognition Developer software (Trimble
   (R)), as well as with the primary data collection in situ, in which the
   key species that characterize each phytoecological unit were noted and
   the distribution patterns were described vegetation cover. It was
   identified that the area has 02 predominant phytophysiognomies: caatinga
   and seasonally dry tropical forest. The phytosionomies found are
   conditioned by both environmental factors and human intervention,
   generating complex distribution patterns, sometimes with no trends,
   where randomness is prominent. 02 phytoecological units from the
   caatinga and 04 from the forest were identified, the latter being
   restricted to areas with less extension in the higher zones and
   surrounded by stretches of steep slope.},

Abstract = {Background: Variation in the distribution and abundance of woody plants
   as consequence of disturbances such as fire may be explained by lineage
   age.
   Aims: We tested whether lowland tropical tree lineages that colonise
   secondary forests are more late-diverging than clades from old-growth
   forests, and whether tree phylogenetic beta diversity from old-growth to
   secondary forests is higher in burned than non-burned secondary forests.
   Methods: We sampled tree communities in old-growth forests and in
   secondary forests with distinct disturbance histories (burned and
   unburned). We calculated mean family age in each plot, and tested for
   differences among forest types using ANOVA. A phylogenetic
   fuzzy-weighting procedure was employed to generate a matrix describing
   the abundance of tree clades per plot, which was then analysed using a
   principal coordinate analysis.
   Results: Most clades found in old-growth forests were underrepresented
   in secondary forests, which have been heavily colonised by a single
   species from a young lineage that is not found in old-growth forests.
   Phylogenetic beta diversity was higher between unburned secondary
   forests and old-growth forests than between burned secondary forests and
   old-growth forests.
   Conclusions: The capacity of Neotropical trees to colonise secondary
   forests and persist after fire disturbance may be related to the age of
   distinct lineages.},

Journal = {BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {26},
Number = {9},
Pages = {2007-2027},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The Brazil nut (the seeds of the rainforest tree Bertholletia excelsa)
   is the only globally traded seed collected from the wild by forest-based
   harvesters across the Amazon basin. The large geographic scale of Brazil
   nut exploitation and the significant contributions to local livelihoods,
   national economies, and forest-based development over the last decades,
   merit a review of the ``conservation-through-use'' paradigm. We use
   Elinor Ostrom's framework for assessing sustainability in
   socioecological systems: (1) resource unit, (2) users, (3) governance
   system, and (4) resource system, to determine how different contexts and
   external developments generate specific conservation and development
   outcomes. We find that the resource unit reacts robustly to the type and
   level of extraction currently practiced; that resource users have built
   on a self-organized system that had defined boundaries and access to the
   resource; that linked production chains, market networks and informal
   financing work to supply global markets; and that local harvesters have
   used supporting alliances with NGOs and conservationists to formalize
   and secure their endogenous governance system and make it more
   equitable. As a result, the Brazil nut model represents a
   socioecological system that may not require major changes to sustain
   productivity. Yet since long-term Brazil nut production seems
   inextricably tied to a continuous forest cover, and because planted
   Brazil nut trees currently provide a minimal contribution to total nut
   production basin-wide, we call to preserve, diversify and intensify
   production in Brazil nut-rich forests that will inevitably become ever
   more integrated within human-modified landscapes over time.},

Title = {The influence of reproductive traits on liana abundance 10 years after
   conventional and reduced-impacts logging in the eastern Brazilian Amazon},
Journal = {FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {221},
Number = {1-3},

Abstract = {Balancing timber production and conservation in tropical forests
   requires an understanding of the impacts of silvicultural manipulations
   on specific groups of organisms. Lianas are characteristic of many
   tropical forests, where they contribute to species diversity, ecosystem
   functioning, and biomass. However, lianas can also impede timber
   production by increasing logging damage and slowing tree growth. Cutting
   lianas prior to logging can mitigate the negative effects, but may
   adversely affect a forest's value for conservation. To evaluate the
   effects of forest management activities on lianas, this study assessed
   the impacts of logging, both with and without pre-logging liana cutting,
   on the relative abundance and population structure of five species of
   lianas that differed in primary reproductive strategies.
   Inventories of the five study species were conducted 10 years following
   logging in 4.4 ha plots in three adjacent treatment areas: (1) an
   old-growth forest reserve, (2) a selectively-logged forest that used
   conventional practices for the region, and (3) a forest that was logged
   using reduced-impact logging (RIL) techniques including complete liana
   cutting prior to logging. Liana species responses to logging varied
   according to their primary modes of reproduction. Croton ascendens, a
   pioneer species with a persistent seed bank, had a higher abundance in
   the two logging treatments relative to the old-growth forest, while
   Serjania caracasana, an early successional species lacking a persistent
   seed bank, showed abundant regeneration following conventional logging
   but negligible regeneration following RIL. In contrast, Acacia
   multipinnata, also an early successional species, showed abundant
   regeneration following RIL owing to the sprouting of persistent
   prostrate stems present on the forest floor prior to logging. In both
   logged areas, Bauhinia guianensis recruited abundant climbing stems from
   self-supporting seedlings that were present prior to logging, but it
   showed greatly reduced seedling density following RIL. By sprouting
   profusely from both fallen stems and stumps, Memora schomburgkii
   recruited abundant small-diameter climbing stems in both of the logging
   treatments. The results of this study demonstrate that there are
   interspecific differences in liana responses to different types of
   logging and that knowing species' primary modes of reproduction is a
   valuable first step toward predicting those responses. (c) 2005 Elsevier

Abstract = {Sustainable use of soil, maintaining or improving its quality, is one of
   the goals of diversification in farmlands. From this point of view,
   bioindicators associated with C, N and P cycling can be used in
   assessments of land-use effects on soil quality. The aim of this study
   was to investigate chemical, microbiological and biochemical properties
   of soil associated with C, N and P under different land uses in a farm
   property with diversified activity in northern Parana, Brazil. Seven
   areas under different land uses were assessed: fragment of native
   Atlantic Forest; growing of peach-palm (Bactrys gasipaes); sugarcane
   ratoon (Saccharum officinarum) recently harvested, under renewal;
   growing of coffee (Coffea arabica) intercropped with tree species;
   recent reforestation (1 year) with native tree species, previously under
   annual crops; annual crops under no- tillage, rye (Cecale cereale);
   secondary forest, regenerated after abandonment (for 20 years) of an
   avocado (Persea americana) orchard. The soil under coffee, recent
   reforestation and secondary forest showed higher concentrations of
   organic carbon, but microbial biomass and enzyme activities were higher
   in soils under native forest and secondary forest, which also showed the
   lowest metabolic coefficient, followed by the peach- palm area. The
   lowest content of water-dispersible clay was found in the soil under
   native forest, differing from soils under sugarcane and secondary
   forest. Soil cover and soil use affected total organic C contents and
   soil enzyme and microbial activities, such that more intensive
   agricultural uses had deeper impacts on the indicators assessed.
   Calculation of the mean soil quality index showed that the secondary
   forest was closest to the fragment of native forest, followed by the
   peach-palm area, coffee-growing area, annual crop area, the area of
   recent reforestation and the sugarcane ratoon area.},

Journal = {ANAIS DA ACADEMIA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIAS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {91},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {This study aimed to measure the wildlife consumption of Euterpe edulis
   fruit and use this data to discuss management possibilities. To estimate
   infructescence fruit volume consumed, collectors were installed in
   fruit-bearing palms. To characterize consumption from the ground,
   samples were placed next to fruiting palms. To identify wildlife and
   their activities, camera traps were installed in infructescences and on
   the ground. The results suggested that there was a small fruit surplus
   (1.8 \%), and this finding indicated the possibility of a harvest to
   reduce food for the wildlife. However, recurrent variations in the
   annual fruit production (21.4 \%) were also noted, and suggested that
   wildlife could tolerate some fruit harvesting. Thus, a harvest could be
   restricted to fruit volume that exceeds the annual average (94
   kg/ha/year). Turdus flavipes, a migratory' bird, was the most active
   species in the dispersal of seeds; this finding indicates the need for
   broader conservation strategies. Wildlife composition also changed along
   with the fruiting, and this alteration suggests that dependence on the
   fruit is variable among different species. Seed germination and seedling
   mortality were high, results that indicate that local conditions may
   have a predominant effect on seed volume in natural regeneration
   density.},

Abstract = {Thinning intensities in Fagus orientalis Lipsky. stands may influence
   the soil properties, arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi symbiosis, and

   investigate the impact of four thinning intensities-control (no

   thinning (55\%)-implemented five years ago in pure oriental beech
   forests. In this context, the percentage indicates the proportion of
   trees removed by each thinning intensity, based on the total number of
   trees before thinning. Our focus encompassed soil physical-chemical
   properties, AM fungi community composition, and root colonization. At
   the intense thinning sites, the soil organic carbon, total nitrogen,
   available potassium, AMF spore density, and root colonization increased
   by 209.7, 88.9, 115.8, 404.9, and 448.5\%, respectively, when compared
   to the control sites. This suggests a potential rise in AMF spore
   density and root colonization-a vital aspect for natural regeneration.
   These findings highlight the importance of considering management
   practices in forest systems that can enhance the root system in a

Abstract = {Achieving ambitious global restoration commitments is a huge challenge.
   The Atlantic Forest Restoration Pact, created in 2009 as a movement to
   restore 15 Mha of degraded/deforested lands by 2050, pledged 1 Mha
   towards the 2020 Bonn Challenge. We documented the restoration of an
   estimated 673,510-740,555 ha of native forests from 2011 to 2015 in the
   Atlantic Forest, and expect that a total of 1.35-1.48 Mha will be under
   recovery by 2020. The Pact is one of the first Brazilian restoration
   initiatives to monitor an international restoration commitment and to
   demonstrate that ambitious targets can be reached. Part of this success
   in large-scale restoration is related to three main Pact activities: (i)
   development of restoration governance, communication and articulation;
   (ii) promotion of strategies to influence public policies; and (iii)
   establishment of restoration monitoring systems. The experience and
   lessons learned by the Pact could inspire and inform other restoration

Abstract = {Tree plantations used for carbon sequestration or forest restoration
   often support diverse plant communities. However, it is unknown how
   rates of successional change in tree plantations compare to secondary
   forests. In this study, we compared the successional trajectory of tree
   plantations to that of secondary forests that were between 8 and 23
   years old. Censuses of woody plants (>= 2 cm dbh {[}diameter at breast
   height]) in seven tree plantation plots and seven secondary forest plots
   (30 x 30 m) were conducted over three years (May 2013-July 2016) in a
   lowland tropical forest. Secondary forests were naturally regenerating
   from abandoned cattle pastures. Tree plantations were monocultures of
   two different native species (Vochysia guatemalensis and Hieronyma
   alchorneoides), planted for carbon sequestration. We measured the change
   in stem density, basal area, species density, rarefied species richness,
   and relative abundance of different growth forms and regeneration
   guilds. We found that differences in stem density and basal area between
   these two forest types were declining. Nevertheless, we did not find
   evidence for differences between forest types in the rate of
   accumulation of species richness when accounting for sample size. On the
   other hand, even though the successional trajectory in tree plantations
   was very similar to secondary forests, there were differences between
   forest types in species composition. The rate of change in relative
   abundance of different growth forms and regeneration guilds was similar
   in both forest types. Overall, our results suggest that structural - but
   not compositional differences - between tree plantations and secondary
   forests are converging during the second decade of succession.},

Abstract = {In some regions of Southern Brazil, historic silvopastoral systems,
   known as caivas in Santa Catarina State and faxinais in Parana State,
   are used in remnants of Araucaria Forest. In these systems, the
   herbaceous stratum of the forest is composed of natural pasture on which
   animals graze. In order to better understand the impact of caivas on the
   conservation of the Araucaria Forest, the effects of different
   intensities of pasture management, mowing practices, and cattle grazing
   on natural regeneration were assessed. The experiment was carried out in
   eight caivas from 2015 to 2016, during which the forest regeneration was
   monitored every six months. Throughout the study period, 48 tree species
   that are characteristic of the Araucaria Forest were identified. In all
   evaluated scenarios, the regeneration of tree species was present,
   dynamic, and continuous in the caivas. The intensity of pasture use did
   not affect the indicators of diversity, species richness, and
   regeneration density. However, there was limited similarity among caivas
   with the same type of pasture management. Mowing had the greatest impact
   on regeneration, with a marked reduction in the density of regenerants,
   although it did not affect species richness. Given the abundance of
   species in the regeneration, including many species typical of advanced
   forest succession, it is possible to confirm that these systems present
   high levels of resilience with respect to the conservation of
   biodiversity, despite the occurrence of livestock grazing for
   generations. The results also indicate that it is possible to
   successfully implement strategies for pasture intensification in caivas.
   However, this practice must be associated with preservation strategies
   in forest areas that are more fragile and diverse, in order to ensure
   the system is sustainable across all dimensions.},

Abstract = {Forest loss and degradation in the Brazilian Amazon due to mining
   activities has been intense for many years. To reverse this situation, a
   range of restoration programs for deforested and degraded areas have
   been created and implemented. The aim of this study was to analyze the
   tree composition, successional stage, dispersal and pollination
   syndromes, conservation status of tree species, and proximity to seed
   sources under different forest restoration techniques (seedling
   planting, natural regeneration, and assisted natural regeneration or
   nucleation) implemented in post-mining sites in the Paragominas
   municipality (Para, Brazil). Sixty permanent plots with a restoration
   age of three years were selected for tree sampling. A total of 119
   species, 83 genera and 27 botanical families were identified. Sites
   restored with different techniques significantly differed in tree
   composition. Seedling planting sites exhibited the highest abundance,
   species richness, and diversity values. These were dominated less by
   pioneer species when compared to the natural regeneration and nucleation
   sites. Entomophilic pollination and zoochory dispersal were highly
   represented in the three types of restored sites. Abundance and species
   richness were negatively correlated with distance from plots to seed
   sources, and they sharply declined in natural regeneration and
   nucleation plots at >250 m from seed sources. Four threatened species
   were identified in the restored sites. We conclude that a combination of
   different restoration strategies at three-year-old post-mining
   restoration sites in the Brazilian Amazon results in the recovery of
   considerable levels of local tree diversity.},

Abstract = {Different types of matrices can perform different disturbance regimes
   over remnant forests, which can ultimately affect plant diversity. To
   address these issues, we studied 60 plots in forest remnants embedded
   within sugarcane plantations and pasturelands in the Atlantic Forest of
   Southeastern Brazil. Our objectives were to evaluate general patterns of
   plant diversity and to assess the influence of landscape structure and
   dynamics on plant richness and diversity. We recorded 297 species in two
   strata. (DBH superior stratum >= 4.8 cm > inferior stratum). Overall,
   diversity of the inferior stratum was higher in pastureland forest
   remnants than in sugarcane matrices. In the superior stratum, time since
   abandonment represented a greater influence. Considering the partition
   of diversity, more than 40\% of total diversity was due to the alpha
   component alone in all cases, but it was significantly lower than
   expected. Beta components among forest remnants, landscapes and matrices
   were higher than expected for both strata, whether together or
   separately. Habitat heterogeneity showed a higher contribution to the
   total floristic diversity, but among remnants this contribution was even
   more significant. Forest remnants in pasturelands had a more dynamic
   land use history and parameters of landscape dynamics were more related
   to plant diversity. For remnants in the sugarcane matrices, species
   richness and composition were explained by landscape structure. Our
   results highlight that there is an important plant community diffused in
   the forest remnants of human-modified landscapes. Therefore, conserving
   the majority of remnants and restoring degraded ones must be a key
   conservation strategy. (C) 2021 Associacao Brasileira de Ciencia Ecol

Abstract = {The diversity of cultivated plants in the agroforestry systems can

   area of environmental fragility. The microbial biomass carbon (MB-C),
   soil basal respiration (BResp), metabolic quotient (q-CO2) and microbial
   quotient (q-mic) were evaluated in the entire profile of a Typic
   Udorthents, obtaining stratified data in the 0-2.5; 2.5-5; 5-10; 10-15;
   15-30; 30-45 and 45-60 cm layers. The NR area had the highest MB-C (866
   mg C kg(-1) soil) and BResp (5 mg C-CO2 kg(-1) soil h(-1)) in the 0-2.5
   cm layer in relation to the AF5 (686 mg C kg(-1) soil; 4 mg C-CO2 kg(-1)
   soil h(-1)) and AF10 (478 mg C kg(-1) soil; 4 mg C-CO2 kg(-1) soil

   average values in the profile of 7 mg C-CO2 g(-1) MB-C h(-1) for q-CO2
   and 1.6 \% for q-mic, demonstrating vital process similarity between
   systems. The phytosociological characteristics that interfere with the
   microbiological attributes were the plant species richness (0-2.5 cm)
   and plant diversity (2.5-5 cm). The epiedaphic fauna active in the
   litter was also assessed by pitfall traps and the average number of
   individuals per trap (238 for NR, 281 for AF5, 299 for AF10), the order
   richness (15 for NR; 14 for AF5, 13 for AF10) and relative frequencies
   did not differ among treatments, confirming that agroforests are in an

   biomass (stocked biomass and regrowth rate). Our results show that soil
   texture was influenced by landscape position, in which the shoulder had
   lower clay content. The chemical characteristics were not influenced by
   topographic conditions. The physico-hydric characteristics were
   influenced by the particle size of the soil. The natural regeneration
   presented few species, and was not influenced by its position in the

Abstract = {A method based on fuzzy modeling was developed for the classification of
   the stages of a forest succession. The construction of the model
   considered the criteria established by CONAMA, which define secondary
   vegetation in the initial, middle, and advanced stages of regeneration
   of the Atlantic Forest, as guidelines for the management of native
   vegetation in the state of Sao Paulo. The proposed model was applied for
   classifying cases reported in the literature, where floristic and
   phytosociological analysis of the forest structure had been performed
   employing the judgment of experts. The fuzzy modeling approach provided

Abstract = {Demographic aspects of palmiteiro (Euterpe edulis Mart.) in an area of
   the Hillside Atlantic Forest, Maquine - Rio Grande do Sul. This study
   was carried out oil the northern coast of Rio Grande do Sul State. The
   first stage was about a phytosociological survey of individuals with DBH
   beginning with 5 cm. The second stage was with samples of the palm
   Population distributed in classes by size, including those Cut. In file
   first stage, 186 ind./ha were found, including those cut. In the second
   stage the number of individuals estimated was 3,723 seedlings (69.74\%),
   1 373 Young trees (15.13\% young I and 10.73\% young II), 243 immature
   trees ( 2.81\% immature I and 1.44\% immature II) and four adults
   (0.14\%). Regarding relationship between file living and dead plants, it
   was verified 1\% of adult live plants, 23\%, of Cut individuals and 76\%
   of dead bases. The low percentage of adults and the high percentage of
   cut individuals and stein bases indicate all exploitation of the species
   without the necessary control for natural regeneration and preservation
   of the population ill the studied area.},

   exotic species Pinus elliottii Engelm., in Juiz de For a, Minas Gerais,
   Brazil. We allocated 10 plots of 20x20m in the forest patch (2ha) and
   sampled all trees with DBH >= 5cm. We sampled 635 trees belonging to 38
   species. P. elliottii showed strong dominance, with 54.2\% of the

   pappus, Anadenanthera colubrina, Tibouchina granulosa and Myrsine
   coriacea) were pioneers and common in secondary forests of the region.
   Due to the strong ecological dominance by P. elliottii, the Shannon
   diversity index (H') was only 1.48 nats/ind, low in comparison with
   other secondary forests in the region. The results demonstrate the need

Abstract = {This study was conducted in a semideciduous forest fragment of 52
   hectares, known as Rosal Forest, in the municipality of Guacui, Espirito
   Santo state. It had the objective to test vertical stratification
   methodologies, evaluating the appropriateness of these methodologies
   based on the ecological successional classification of the species. To
   do so, the method of sampling fixed area was used, and distributed 16
   plots of 600 m(2), in a systematic way. All individuals with DBH >= 5
   cm, had their total height measures directly. The trees went through the
   botanical classification identification process and had their
   classifications in accordance with their ecological groups. The analysis
   of the tree vertical structure was made by the distribution of the
   number of trees in the strata, using four methods: Method 1 - Souza
   (1990), Method 2 - Souza et al. (2003), Method 3 - IUFRO, and Method 4 -
   Calegario et al. (1994). The classification results were compared to the
   successional classification of species, according to the ecologic groups
   that they belong to. The method 1 did not allow a detailed analysis
   about the behavior of stratum II species, because of the strong
   tendencies to concentrate a greater number of individuals in this
   stratum, already the Method 2 has allowed a greater detail. The Method 3
   minimized the problem encountered in Method 1, but the dominant height
   change of the sample can change the whole discussion, demonstrating the
   method weakness. Method 4 did not bring good results for the forest
   stratification under study, because this method only divided in two

Abstract = {This study evaluated the influence of vegetation structure on bird
   diversity, guilds, and the richness and composition of species in
   different successional stages of the subtropical Atlantic rain forest.
   Much of the land that was formerly agricultural in the Brazilian
   Atlantic rain forest region is now given over to secondary forests. The
   habitat structure of these successional forests vary and are influenced
   by time, historical use and local variables, all of which affect bird
   assemblies. Sampling of bird species was carried out through
   audio-visual point counts conducted in forests varying from six years
   after abandonment to old-growth areas. Forests in which the point counts
   were conducted were further classified into initial, intermediate and
   advanced stages according to 11 vegetation structural variables, through
   cluster analyses. The study found that bird richness and diversity were
   similar between initial and intermediate stages, but higher in advanced
   areas. Bird species composition differed between the initial and
   advanced stages, whereas the guild composition of initial forests
   differed in both intermediate and advanced stages. Late successional
   forests had more heterogeneous habitats, and some species and guilds
   were found only in this stage. However, bird diversity and species and
   guild composition were similar in intermediate and advanced forests,
   emphasizing the importance of successional forests for conservation
   efforts, especially when they are located near old-growth forests and
   conservation units. The recovery patterns of the successional forests
   studied indicate a great potential for the natural regeneration of the
   Atlantic rain forest, at least in areas where slash-and-burn agriculture
   was the previous landuse.},

Abstract = {Environmental legislation requires well-defined concepts, criteria, and
   indicators to support its effective implementation and provide legal
   security to the diverse stakeholders involved. The Native Vegetation
   Protection Law (NVPL) establishes the obligation to restore native
   vegetation in protected areas within rural properties. This federal law
   is regulated and implemented by each state through its own Environmental
   Compliance Program (Programa de Regulariza \& ccedil;\& atilde;o
   Ambiental {[}PRA], in Portuguese). Landowners must register their land,
   indicate whether native vegetation needs to be restored (i.e. if there
   is an environmental debt), and submit a restoration plan to the state
   government for analysis, validation, and approval. Due to the high cost
   of forest restoration, natural regeneration has most likely become a
   viable strategy for Amazonian landowners to meet their environmental
   debts. However, according to disturbance intensity, frequency, and
   duration, natural regeneration will not always succeed. In this context,
   we analyzed the PRAs of the seven main Amazonian states to assess the
   status of their implementation, identify how natural regeneration is
   defined and approached in the law, and evaluate whether improvements in
   the law are needed to ensure effective restoration to accomplish the
   NVPL.},

Title = {Direct seeded and colonizing species guarantee successful early

Journal = {FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {451},
Month = {NOV 1},
Abstract = {South Amazon forests have been highly deforested, including the legally
   protected riparian forests. The Xingu watershed restoration program used
   direct seeding of native trees to restore 5000 ha of forests from 2006
   to 2018. Direct seeding is a low cost method, easy-to-implement at large
   scales. The literature on this method concludes that only a few species
   manage to establish successfully, resulting in an impoverished forest.
   In this study, we aimed to (i) assess changes in species composition
   over a 10-year chronosequence in direct seeded sites, (ii) evaluate
   life-history traits of direct seeded and colonizer species, and (iii)
   investigate whether colonizer arrival is influenced by landscape
   structure and dispersal syndrome. We sampled 72 1-10 year-old direct
   seeded sites along a latitudinal gradient of 600 km, at the Upper Xingu
   Basin, state of Mato Grosso, Brazil. From the 152 direct seeded species,
   90 species established themselves, and 67 new species colonized the
   restored sites. Succession started off dominated by a single pioneer
   species; then shared dominance with five other light-demanding species,
   while slow-growing species were present in the understory. Direct seeded
   and established species are disproportionately more orthodox,
   wind-dispersed seeds, usually dispersing during the dry season.
   Colonizer species are similar to the ones found in reference forests,
   regarding the proportion of animal-dispersed and recalcitrant seeds. We
   found no relationship between forest cover and colonizer richness.
   Direct seeding imposes a functional diversity filter due to the short
   period of seed harvesting, storage limitations, and field emergence.
   However, established species comprise diverse successional classes,
   which form an initial structure that facilitates species colonization,
   reducing the biodiversity filters caused by the direct seeding method
   over the years.},

Abstract = {The floodplains of meandering rivers in southeastern Brazil represent
   places where the sedimentary record associated with the history of
   transition/ecotone areas and exchange of biomes accumulates, such as the
   Cerrado (Cerradao Forest) and Atlantic Forest (Semideciduous-Riparian
   Forest). The present study aims to use palynological, isotopic (delta
   C-13, delta N-15 and C-14), and anthracological indicators in cores
   taken from three abandoned meander bends to make inferences about
   environmental evolution, vegetation reconstruction, and climatic
   inferences. The study area is located in the Mogi Guacu River Basin, in
   the countryside of Sao Paulo State. The studies show that similar to
   2,730 BP (stage I), the area underwent through a more humid climatic
   phase compared to the current one, which allowed the expansion of the
   Riparian Semideciduous Forest. After that date, in stage II (1,800 to
   510 BP), the percentage of the Cerrado (Cerradao Forest) increased, due
   to a drier period. From 510 BP to the present day (stage III), humidity
   has taken place with a new expansion of the Riparian Semideciduous
   Forest, although elements of Cerrado are present. Microscopic charcoal
   fragments were found in all stages and may infer the incidence of
   paleo-wildfires during the Late Holocene. The results indicate that both
   phytophysiognomies remained for the studied period, varying their
   expansion depending on the humidity present in each stage. Although
   lakes formed by abandoned meanders are not areas with the best
   palynological record, they are frequent environments in the interior of
   the continents. If properly interpreted, they may provide relevant
   information to vegetation and climatic changes for the areas.},

   between Cerrado and Amazon Forest in Nova Xavantina, Mato Grosso State,
   Brazil. The objective was to evaluate and compare the dynamics of the
   woody community at three sections of the forest (upper, middle and
   lower) in a topographic gradient over a seven year period. The inventory
   consisted of 141 permanent plots (10 x 10 m) distributed in the three
   sections where all individuals >= 15 cm girth at breast height were
   recorded in 1999 and 2006. Based in density and basal area, the Periodic
   Annual Increment (PAI) and dynamics parameters were calculated. In all
   forest sections the mortality was higher than recruitment. The lower
   section was the most dynamic, because presented the higher mortality
   (6.84\%) and recruitment (4.73\%) rates. The community was dynamic,
   probably due to its current intermediary successional stage and the
   different environmental conditions depending on the topography. The PAT
   values of the species in common with all sections confirm differences in
   increment, indicating that some have restrictions and others benefit to
   grow in certain environments. On the other hand, some species had
   similar PAT values in the three forest sections, confirming a plasticity
   to adapt to different environmental conditions. The species presented
   different recruitment, mortality and increment rates, related to the
   ecological groups and topographic position. We suggest that the
   topographic gradient and seasonal flooding contribute to include this
   community among the most dynamic tropical forests.},

Abstract = {Secondary forests (SFs) regenerating on previously deforested land
   account for large, expanding areas of tropical forest cover. Given that
   tropical forests rank among Earth's most important reservoirs of carbon
   and biodiversity, SFs play an increasingly pivotal role in the carbon
   cycle and as potential habitat for forest biota. Nevertheless, their
   capacity to regain the biotic attributes of undisturbed primary forests
   (UPFs) remains poorly understood. Here, we provide a comprehensive
   assessment of SF recovery, using extensive tropical biodiversity,
   biomass, and environmental datasets. These data, collected in 59
   naturally regenerating SFs and 30 co-located UPFs in the eastern Amazon,
   cover >1,600 large- and small-stemmed plant, bird, and dung beetles
   species and a suite of forest structure, landscape context, and
   topoedaphic predictors. After up to 40 years of regeneration, the SFs we
   surveyed showed a high degree of biodiversity resilience, recovering, on
   average among taxa, 88\% and 85\% mean UPF species richness and
   composition, respectively. Across the first 20 years of succession, the
   period for which we have accurate SF age data, biomass recovered at
   1.2\% per year, equivalent to a carbon uptake rate of 2.25 Mg/ha per
   year, while, on average, species richness and composition recovered at
   2.6\% and 2.3\% per year, respectively. For all taxonomic groups,
   biomass was strongly associated with SF species distributions. However,
   other variables describing habitat complexity-canopy cover and
   understory stem density-were equally important occurrence predictors for
   most taxa. Species responses to biomass revealed a successional
   transition at approximately 75 Mg/ha, marking the influx of
   high-conservation-value forest species. Overall, our results show that
   naturally regenerating SFs can accumulate substantial amounts of carbon
   and support many forest species. However, given that the surveyed SFs
   failed to return to a typical UPF state, SFs are not substitutes for
   UPFs.},

Abstract = {In the Caatinga, the maintenance of forest ecosystems depends on natural
   regeneration and several factors that can act in two ways: 1) provide
   the perpetuation of communities composed of few species that dominate
   the adult and saplings strata, resulting in floristic similarities; 2)
   provide local differentiation between adult and saplings strata.
   However, these relationships remain poorly understood, as it is not
   known whether the factors acting on a local scale favor the floristic
   similarity between the adult and saplings strata or if these patterns
   are found in conserved and anthropized areas. This work evaluated the
   floristic similarity between the adult and saplings strata of
   hyperxerophilous caatinga woody-shrubby vegetation in conserved and
   anthropized areas. In two areas of conserved and anthropized
   hyperxerophilous Caatinga, adult and saplings individuals were measured
   and floristic richness and qualitative floristic similarity were
   evaluated. The floristic similarity between the adult and saplings
   strata was statistically compared using the Chao-Sorensen index. In both
   sites, although there was a large number of species exclusive to the
   adult stratum, the Chao-Sorensen index indicates high floristic
   similarity between strata. The analysis of this behavior together with
   the assessment of community structure shows that few species can be
   responsible for the key processes that structure and control the main
   mechanisms of persistence of these ecosystems. This can be attributed to
   the existence of locally uniform conditions that can define the
   dominance of adapted species groups.},

Abstract = {The present study aimed to evaluate the tree species population dynamics
   in a fragment of Montane Araucaria Forest, in the municipality of Lages,
   Santa Catarina (SC) state, along a period of four years (2008-2012). For
   this, for all species sampled, in 50 permanent plots of 10x20m, the
   regeneration guilds {[}pioneer (P), light-demanding climax (LDC) and
   shade-tolerant climax (STC)] and dynamics rates were determined
   (mortality, recruitment, loss and gain in basal area, net change in
   abundance and basal area). The existence of significant association
   between regeneration guilds and dynamic rates was verified by chisquare
   tests, applied to contingency tables. Changes in relative participation
   of regeneration guilds between years were analyzed using proportion
   tests. In 2008, 87 species were found (P: 9, LDC: 64, STC: 11,
   nonclassified: 3), 1.841 ind center dot ha(-1) and 36.17 m(2)center dot
   ha(-1). In 2012, 86 species (P: 9, LDC: 63, STC: 11, non-classified: 3),
   1.882ind center dot ha(-1) and 39.17 m(2 center dot)ha(-1) were
   observed. Most species showed gains in basal area. Among the most
   abundant, the highest rates of recruitment and basal area gain were
   observed for Banara tomentosa Clos, with, respectively, 5.43\%. year(-1)
   and 6.08\%. year(-1), and the highest rates of mortality and basal area
   loss occurred for Zanthoxylum rhoifolium Lam., with, respectively,
   7.75\%. year-1 and 4.74\%. year(-1). No significant association between
   the dynamics patterns and regeneration guilds was observed, whose
   relative participations in the community, during the evaluated period,
   were constants. Therefore, it is possible to conclude that the forest
   fragment is in the process of structural instability, indicated by the
   increment of the number of individuals and basal area, and
   floristic-successional stability, due to the low floristic substitution
   and maintenance of the relative importance of the regeneration guilds,
   along the evaluated period.},

Title = {Combining regional to local restoration goals in the Brazilian Atlantic
   forest},
Journal = {REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE},
Year = {2021},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {To achieve regional and international large-scale restoration goals with
   minimum costs, several restoration commitments rely on natural
   regeneration, a passive and inexpensive strategy. However, natural
   regeneration potential may vary within the landscape, mainly due to its
   historical context. In this work, we use spatially explicit restoration
   scenarios to explore how and where, within a given region, multiple
   restoration commitments could be combined to achieve cost-effectiveness
   outcomes. Our goal is to facilitate the elaboration of forest
   restoration plans at the regional level, taking into consideration the
   costs for active and passive restoration methods. The approach includes
   (1) a statistical analysis to estimate the natural regeneration
   potential for a given area based on alternative sets of biophysical,
   land cover, and/or socioeconomic factors and (2) the use of a land
   change allocation model to explore the cost-effectiveness of combining
   multiple restoration commitments in a given area through alternative
   scenarios. We test our approach in a strategic region in the Brazilian
   Atlantic Forest Biome, the Paraiba Valley in Sao Paulo State. Using the
   available data for 2011, calibrated for 2015, we build alternative
   scenarios for allocating natural regeneration until 2025. Our models
   indicate that the natural regeneration potential of the region is
   actually very low, and the cost-effectiveness outcomes are similar for
   all scenarios. We believe our approach can be used to support the
   regional-level decision-making about the implementation of multiple
   commitments aiming at the same target area. It can also be combined with
   other approaches for more refined analysis (e.g., optimization models).},

Abstract = {Research on areas with similar disturbance histories but different
   intensities allow inferences about the dynamics of natural regeneration.
   This research aimed to identify which descriptive values have been
   recovered in the course of natural succession along a disturbance
   gradient on rain forest stretches. Three sampling sites were
   established: control, moderately disturbed, and disturbed. In each one
   were installed 40 plots of 1m(2) aiming to determine the floristic
   composition, structure and diversity. There were found 102 tree and
   shrub species, distributed in 31 families and 66 genera in the
   regenerating stratum. The number of families, the richness and diversity
   (H') were reducing according to the increasing of disturbance intensity.
   There was higher floristic similarity among the moderately disturbed
   site and disturbed site. The lowest similarity was found between the
   control and disturbed sites. The species composition showed clear
   variation among environments. The disturbance mainly influences the
   floristic composition and diversity of forests while the structure is
   recovered more quickly. Therefore the actions applied in order to obtain
   the forest restoration may be focused on reestablishing species
   richness, function and structure of the forest instead of your original
   floristic composition, because naturally it may not occur.},

Abstract = {The analysis of the systematic transitions in the forested landscape and
   the study of the forest fragmentation patterns allow us to deepen our
   understanding of the changes in the vegetation ground cover. The
   importance of knowing the intricate patterns of the land usage of the
   upper basin of the Amazon region is widely recognized. This zone is one
   of the most diverse biological areas in the world, is home to large
   areas of mature tropical cloud forest and demonstrates high
   probabilities of stable climatic conditions in light of global warming.
   The research quantified systematic transitions through the ``loss{''}
   and `gain of the different categories of landscape during the
   eighteen-year study period of the Ecuadorian Amazon Region (EAR), the
   forest fragmentation patterns were also analyzed based on a set of
   indicators. Therefore, with respect to the entirety of the landscape,
   the results registered for the ground coverage in forested areas during
   the first period (1990-2000), show a decrease of 6.99\% and an increase
   of 0.68\%; and during the second period (2000-2008), show a decrease of
   3.99\% and an increase of 2.14\%. It demonstrated that forest and
   agricultural areas tended to replace or be replaced by herbaceous
   vegetation faster than expected fortuitously. Finally, the indices of
   fragmentation signaled intense changes during the 1990-2000 period with
   a reduction during the period 2000-2008. Percentages registered in the
   Largest Patch Index (LPI) were between 79.58\%; 52.39\% and 49.99\%
   respectively; while the Patch Density (PD) varied between 0.04; 0.06 and
   0.07. This suggests the propensity of forest cover to remain intact. The
   results of this investigation suggest a tendency towards stability in
   Ecuador's Amazon landscape. Within the framework for development and
   management of this area, the tendency is natural regeneration. This
   permits a consolidation of the conservation, reforestation, forestation
   and agricultural forestry plans, programs and systems for the protected
   areas in EAR.},

Abstract = {Tropical montane cloud forests (TMCF) have paramount importance with
   regards to hydrological and ecological functions. Despite such
   importance in terms of water provision, they are one of the most
   endangered ecosystems on the planet. One important topic that is still
   unclear is related to TMCF regeneration: can it recover the hydrological
   function of such critical ecosystems? In the present paper, the
   hydrological effects of the natural regeneration of TMCF were examined.
   We selected three catchments with different degrees of TMCF, and we
   examined the relationship between the amount of TMCF over time and
   hydrological variables such as water yields and baseflow using a time
   series (1984-2011). Our results suggest that the increase in TMCF cover
   can contribute to increases in water yield. This pattern was found in a
   catchment with an increase of approximately 20\% of forest cover. In
   catchments with TMCF increase lower than this threshold, water yield and
   flow path were influenced by hydroclimatic variables such as air
   temperature and rainfall. The effect of the reduction in water yield, in
   accordance with the increase in mean temperature, sheds light on
   possible consequences of climate change on ecosystem services produced
   in foggy environments. In light of these findings, aiming to increase
   the water yield, we recommend that regions frequently affected by fog
   are prioritized for forest restoration or conservation. To ensure
   significant effects, regeneration and/or successional development of
   TMCF has to reach at least 20\% of a catchment area.},

Abstract = {In Santa Catarina State, the forested area of the Atlantic Forest
   increased in the last decade, forming a landscape which is characterized
   by a mosaic of fragments of distinct successional stages. This work
   aimed to evaluate the successional process dynamics of two successional
   stages in the secondary Atlantic forest. This study was carried out in a
   secondary forest remnant near Sao Pedro de Alcantara-SC ( area of 40
   ha), abandoned since 1970. Permanent plots (50 x 50 m) were established
   randomly, two in a secondary medium growth (SM) and four in a secondary
   old growth (SA) forest stages. The annual evaluations from 1994 to 2000
   on all trees with DBH >= 5 cm revealed that while the SM stage exhibited
   superior values for density, recruited, dead and branched plants, the SA
   stage exhibited superior values for species richness, basal area and
   diametric class. Botanically, the dominant species and families in each
   stage were clearly observed, as well as the succession dynamics of this
   species group, explosive increase and posterior decrease and
   substitution, perfectly demonstrating the functionality of the
   ecological groups of this forest typology. Finally, the density of the
   plants branched was found to be superior at the initial secondary forest
   stages, although the rates of annual current increase were similar. The
   floristic evaluations also showed that the forests in the Santa Catarina
   coast were in a succession dynamics, where pioneer species have been
   gradually replaced by climax species, increasing species diversity and
   forest biomass.},

   policies toward the sustainable use of natural resources. The present
   study aimed to quantify deforestation, forest recovery and net cover
   change in tropical dry forests (TDFs) in Brazil from 2007 to 2016, and
   investigate how they are associated to biophysical and socioeconomic
   factors. We also assessed the effects of LCC variables in human welfare
   indicators. For this purpose, we used MODIS imagery to calculate TDF
   gross loss (deforestation), gross gain (forest recovery) and net cover
   change (the balance between deforestation and forest recovery) for 294
   counties in three Brazilian states (Minas Gerais, Bahia, and Piaui). We
   obtained seven factors potentially associated to LCC at the county
   level: total county area, road density, humidity index, slope,
   elevation, and \% change in human population and in cattle density. From
   2007 to 2016, TDF cover increased from 76,693 to 80,964 km(2) (+5.6\%).
   This positive net change resulted from a remarkable forest recovery of
   19,018 km2 (24.8\%), offsetting a large deforested area (14,748 km2;
   19.2\%). Practically all these cover changes were a consequence of
   transitions from TDF to pastures and vice-versa, highlighting the
   importance of developing sustainable policies for cattle raising in TDF
   regions. Each LCC variable was associated to different set of factors,
   but two biophysical variables were significantly associated both to TDF
   area gained and lost per county: county area (positively) and slope
   (negatively), indicating that large and flat counties have very dynamic
   LCCs. The TDF net area change was only associated (negatively) to the
   humidity index, reflecting an increase in TDF cover in more arid
   counties. The net increase in Brazilian TDF area is likely a result from
   an interplay of biophysical and socioeconomic factors that reduced
   deforestation and caused pasture abandonment. Although the ecological
   integrity and permanence of secondary TDFs need further investigation,
   the recovery of this semi-arid ecosystem must be valued and accounted
   for in the national forest restoration programs, as it would
   significantly help achieving the goals established in the Bonn agreement
   and the Atlantic Rain Forest pact.},

Abstract = {Two billion ha have been identified globally for forest restoration. Our
   meta-analysis encompassing 221 study landscapes worldwide reveals forest
   restoration enhances biodiversity by 15-84\% and vegetation structure by
   36-77\%, compared with degraded ecosystems. For the first time, we
   identify the main ecological drivers of forest restoration success
   (defined as a return to a reference condition, that is, old-growth
   forest) at both the local and landscape scale. These are as follows: the
   time elapsed since restoration began, disturbance type and landscape
   context. The time elapsed since restoration began strongly drives
   restoration success in secondary forests, but not in selectively logged
   forests (which are more ecologically similar to reference systems).
   Landscape restoration will be most successful when previous disturbance
   is less intensive and habitat is less fragmented in the landscape.
   Restoration does not result in full recovery of biodiversity and
   vegetation structure, but can complement old-growth forests if there is
   sufficient time for ecological succession.},

Year = {2022},
Volume = {27},
Number = {6},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {International agendas focus on limiting unchecked climate change through
   extensive mitigation. Worldwide, several reforestation initiatives
   strive to achieve ambitious goals and promote carbon sequestration on
   land. The greatest potential for reforestation lies within the tropics,
   and the Atlantic Forest is among the protagonists. However, little is
   known about the potential of these reforestations to mitigate climate
   change. Here, we assessed the carbon sequestration potential of Atlantic
   Forest reforestations, both in the field and in the available scientific
   literature. We demonstrate that the Atlantic Forest reforestations
   provide valuable contributions to climate change mitigation. Even at
   young age, reforestations have astonishing potential, with much higher
   carbon sequestration rates than un-assisted natural regeneration of
   later successional stages. Although with lesser potential, un-assisted
   natural regeneration remnants can also be a valuable strategy to aid
   climate mitigation, especially when close to reforestations or
   old-growth forests. We found far greater potential of sequestration in
   all types of forests inside protected areas than unprotected ones,
   highlighting the noteworthy benefits of conservation that buffers
   degradation. Climate action is urgent, and the Atlantic Forest certainly
   is a great contributor to the achievement of such ambitious goals.},

Title = {Structures of tropical dry forests in the Andes: forest conservation,
   composition and the role of fabaceae and myrtaceae},
Journal = {CERNE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {29},
Abstract = {Background: Tropical Dry Forests (TDFs) are repositories of
   biodiversity, ecosystem services and carbon that are threatened by
   fragmentation and climate change. Floristic and phytosociological
   studies are fundamental database for many studies of conservation and
   sustainability, but there is a knowledge gap concerning TDFs, especially
   in the Andes valleys. The aim of this study was to determine the
   phytosociological structure and composition of woody vegetation of seven
   TDFs in the Colombian Andes, and because the flora associated with this
   type of forest has a geographical distribution restricted to each
   locality where this biome exists, provide information on the main
   species, genera and families for conservation and restoration actions as
   well as for future metaanalyses. We sampled seven TDFs with 20 plots of
   25 m x 4 m. Results: In the 1.88 hectares of samples, 8422 individuals
   were surveyed, distributed in 170 species, 120 genera and 50 botanical
   families. Of these species, 78.82\% were identified at the species
   level, 17.05\% at the genus level, and 4.11\% at the family level. The
   most important families were Fabaceae and Myrtaceae. Nitrogen-fixing
   Fabaceae species were prominent amongst the important species,
   especially in low altitude and more stressing sites.Conclusion: The
   structure, composition and ecological importance of these forests must
   be considered for conservation and ecological restoration plans, in
   particular the habitat preference of species along the topographic
   gradient. Particularly noteworthy for conservation are the Myrtaceae
   species because promote connectivity and regeneration by providing
   resources for the fauna, a driver of dispersal, as well as
   nitrogen-fixing Fabaceae species, because promote the resilience and
   natural regeneration of TDFs in the Andes, a key feature of stability.},

Abstract = {Secondary forests and exotic tree plantations are expanding across
   tropical landscapes. However, our current understanding of the value of
   these human-dominated forest landscapes for invertebrate biodiversity
   conservation is still very poor. In this paper, we use the leaf-litter
   ant fauna to assess invertebrate diversity in one commercially managed
   Eucalyptus plantation (four years old), two abandoned plantations of
   different regeneration ages (16 and 31 years), and one neighboring
   secondary Atlantic Forest in Southeastern Brazil. There was a clear
   gradient in species richness from the secondary forest to the managed
   Eucalyptus plantation; richness and diversity peaked in secondary forest
   and in the older regenerating Eucalyptus plantation. Significantly more
   species were recorded in secondary forest samples than in Eucalyptus
   plantations, but Eucalyptus plantations had a similar level of richness.
   Furthermore, a non-metric multidimensional scaling analysis revealed
   clear differences in species composition between the younger managed
   Eucalyptus plantation (understory absent) and habitats with
   sub-developed or developed understory. Eucalyptus plantations were
   characterized by an assemblage of widespread, generalist species very
   different from those known to occur in core forest habitats of
   southeastern Brazil. Our results indicate that while older regenerating
   Eucalyptus plantations can provide habitat to facilitate he persistence
   of generalist ant species, it is unlikely to conserve most of the
   primary forest species, such as specialized predators, Dacetini
   predators, and nomadic species.},

   and a matrix model of forest dynamics or transition matrix (TMM). Data
   from continuous inventories conducted in a Dense Ombrophilous Forest in
   Paragominas, Par ` a state, Brazil, were utilized. Two transects of 9 ha
   each were installed at an area with Reduced Impact Logging, the data was
   collected in 2005 (nine months after logging), then in 2006, 2008, 2010
   and 2012. Considering a period of 8 years after RIL, the individual
   tree-based model and transition matrix give consistent predictions of
   the recruitment in the study area. However, we observed slight
   superiority by the ITM, which presented values closer to the real ones
   for the total number of trees per hectare.},

   Mangroves of Antonina and Guaratuba differed both in the structure of

   and Mastigoceras sp. 1 and Szeptyckitheca sp. 1 (Collembola) were
   indicators of well-conserved areas, whereas families Cicadellidae and
   Delphacidae, Formicidae species Wasmannia auropunctata (Roger, 1863) and
   Camponotus melanoticus Emery, 1894 were indicators of degraded areas.
   From the springtail community, species richness is a metric that can be
   used as a bioindicator. It was observed that all taxonomic
   identification levels allowed for the differentiation of the
   environmental conditions of the sampling areas, with less specific

   recovering structural parameters in an experimental unit subjected to
   different management systems aged 9, 12, 16, 20 and 26 years

   2, cut of trees with DAB > 10 cm; and SC3 - selective cutting 3, cut of

Abstract = {Light is a limiting factor in plant establishment and growth in the
   understory of forests. In this paper, we assessed acclimation capacity
   of Siparuna guianensis, an early secondary successional species. We used
   seedlings and saplings in three regeneration areas with different
   irradiance regimes to determine the traits that confer photoplasticity.
   We examined whether these traits differ at different developmental
   stages. Anatomical characteristics, photochemical efficiency,
   photosynthetic capacity, and growth were analyzed. Multivariate
   component analysis revealed the formation of six clusters: three for
   seedlings (one for each regeneration area) and three for saplings
   (following the same pattern of seedlings, considering the area).
   Increased irradiance favored photosynthetic performance, independently
   of the developmental stage. The same trend was observed for most data on
   chlorophyll (Chl) a fluorescence and the ratios of net photosynthetic
   rate/intercellular CO2 concentration (P (N)/C-i) and P (N)/PPFD. No
   parameter indicated photoinhibition stress. The CO2- and light-response
   curve data indicated that seedlings were already acclimated to tolerate
   variation in irradiance. Anatomical adaptations, such as thickness of
   leaf blade and of adaxial cuticle, were observed in individuals growing
   in areas with higher irradiation. Thinning of spongy parenchyma and
   higher investment into a plant height were observed in seedlings,
   possibly due to the vertical stratification of CO2 and light in the
   understory; because light is a more limiting resource than CO2 in the
   lower stratum of the forest. Photoplasticity in S. guianensis is
   associated with a set of morphological, anatomical, photochemical, and
   biochemical traits, whereas biochemical performance is best acclimated
   to variation in irradiance. These traits differed in seedlings and
   saplings but they were modulated mainly by irradiance in both
   developmental stages.},

Title = {Seed bank of mining tailings as indicator of vegetation regeneration in

Journal = {REVISTA DE BIOLOGIA TROPICAL},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {69},
Number = {2},
Pages = {700-716},
Month = {APR-JUN},
Abstract = {Introduction: The soil seed bank is one of the most important ecological
   indicators for evaluating and monitoring the resilience of degraded
   ecosystems. Likewise, ecological restoration indicators are currently
   used in areas affected by the rupture of the Fundao tailings dam in
   Mariana, Minas Gerais, Brazil. Objective: To evaluate the seed bank at
   two depths of areas affected by mining tailings, Mariana municipality,
   Minas Gerais, Brazil. Methods: 15 samples (40 x 40 cm) were collected
   per level of depth, in the upper layer (Depth1, P-1 = 0-2.5 cm), and
   lower layer (Depth2, P-2 = 2.5-5.0 cm) of the mining tailings to survey
   the viable seed bank, which was later placed in a greenhouse for
   germination and seedling identification. The samples were placed in
   plastic trays to germinate in the nursery, then counted and identified
   weekly for six months. Results: The results showed that there is a seed
   bank in the surface layers of accumulated mining tailings in the
   affected areas of Mariana, with a marked difference between depths in
   terms of species richness and density of individuals. Higher species
   richness and number of individuals were observed in P-1, (1 165
   germinated seeds), belonging to 18 families and 47 species, in
   comparison to P-2 (197 individuals), belonging to 12 families and 23
   species. Probably the seed bank of layer P-1 is influenced by the rain
   of seeds from the nearby forest. On the other hand, the P-2 seed bank
   can be characteristic of mining tailings. Conclusions: Seed bank
   patterns can have positive effects on forest resilience at the
   local-scale, due to the high proportion of native, pioneer and
   anemochorical species of early successional stages.},

Journal = {IFOREST-BIOGEOSCIENCES AND FORESTRY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {5},
Pages = {1-5},
Month = {FEB 6},
Abstract = {The successional model of forest restoration is based on the
   facilitation process, in which the establishment of pioneer tree species
   favors the late successional tree species. We tested the hypothesis of
   facilitation through a case study, comparing tree species diversity in
   the understory of two Neotropical native tree species plantations, Trema
   micrantha (L.) Blume (Cannabaceae) and Schinus molle L. (Anacardiaceae).
   Results obtained under the plantations were compared with an adjacent
   area under spontaneous secondary succession, analyzing the ligneous
   plant diversity, soil physic-chemistry and shading. Additionally, the
   seed rain under the two plantations was analyzed. The area of
   spontaneous secondary succession and the area with T. micrantha had the
   highest ligneous plant diversity. The understory of T. micrantha
   plantation had the lowest light intensity and higher late successional
   species abundance. In addition, T. micrantha had higher plant diversity
   than S. molle, which could be explained at least partially by higher
   diversity in the seed rain. Higher litterfall and mineral content of
   leaves and twigs of T. micrantha did not coincide with higher topsoil
   mineral content under that species. Instead, soil under S. molle had
   higher level of P than the soil under T. micrantha. Data suggest that a
   high diversity of ligneous plants could be thrived by the spontaneous
   succession. On the other hand, T. micrantha had promoted a higher
   richness and abundance of late successional species, which could be
   related to a more pronounced shade effect, in agreement with the
   facilitation conception. The lowest diversity and density of ligneous
   plant species under S. molle characterizes an inhibition effect. T.
   micrantha could be included in restoration plans assembled with other
   species or combined with areas without intervention, whenever the
   spontaneous regeneration is possible.},

Title = {Carbon sequestration potential of second-growth forest regeneration in
   the Latin American tropics},
Journal = {SCIENCE ADVANCES},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {2},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Regrowth of tropical secondary forests following complete or nearly
   complete removal of forest vegetation actively stores carbon in
   aboveground biomass, partially counterbalancing carbon emissions from
   deforestation, forest degradation, burning of fossil fuels, and other
   anthropogenic sources. We estimate the age and spatial extent of lowland
   second-growth forests in the Latin American tropics and model their
   potential aboveground carbon accumulation over four decades. Our model
   shows that, in 2008, second-growth forests (1 to 60 years old) covered
   2.4 million km(2) of land (28.1\% of the total study area). Over 40
   years, these lands can potentially accumulate a total aboveground carbon
   stock of 8.48 Pg C (petagrams of carbon) in aboveground biomass via
   low-cost natural regeneration or assisted regeneration, corresponding to
   a total CO2 sequestration of 31.09 Pg CO2. This total is equivalent to
   carbon emissions from fossil fuel use and industrial processes in all of
   Latin America and the Caribbean from 1993 to 2014. Ten countries account
   for 95\% of this carbon storage potential, led by Brazil, Colombia,
   Mexico, and Venezuela. We model future land-use scenarios to guide
   national carbon mitigation policies. Permitting natural regeneration on
   40\% of lowland pastures potentially stores an additional 2.0 Pg C over
   40 years. Our study provides information and maps to guide
   national-level forest-based carbon mitigation plans on the basis of
   estimated rates of natural regeneration and pasture abandonment. Coupled
   with avoided deforestation and sustainable forest management, natural
   regeneration of second-growth forests provides a low-cost mechanism that
   yields a high carbon sequestration potential with multiple benefits for
   biodiversity and ecosystem services.},

Volume = {32},
Number = {5},
Pages = {524-533},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {In this paper I examined the usefulness of tree population size
   distributions in evaluating the conservation status of populations of an
   endangered tree species. I set expectations derived from two
   complimentary views of the ecology of rainforest trees and examined
   whether they were met by size distributions of populations of the South
   American dominant conifer Araucaria angustifolia and its relationship
   with forest structural characteristics. Specifically, I evaluated the
   expectations that (i) A. angustifolia trees have larger diameter than
   average angiosperm trees and form a higher monospecific canopy layer
   above the shorter angiosperm canopies; (ii) A. angustifolia populations
   are characterized by size distributions with many large individuals and
   a long tail of relatively rare, small individuals (have symmetry
   coefficient < 0); (iii) the symmetry of the size distribution of A.
   angustifolia populations is negatively related to the abundance of large
   (d.b.h. >= 10.0 cm) individuals in the population; and (iv) the
   abundance of A. angustifolia trees is negatively related to the
   abundance of angiosperm trees, as the successional accumulation of
   angiosperm stems would not be accompanied by the recruitment of new A.
   angustifolia. These expectations were evaluated using data on 25
   populations of A. angustifolia sampled in the Rio Grande do Sul State in
   southern Brazil. The first, third and fourth expectations were met,
   while the second one was only partially met. This was because
   populations showed a bimodal distribution regarding symmetry in size
   distribution, with most populations showing normal or negative symmetry,
   and those logged, adult-depleted populations showing positive skewness.},

Title = {Passive restoration of subtropical grasslands leads to incomplete
   recovery of ant communities in early successional stages},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {264},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Understanding how land use and management practices affect biodiversity
   is essential for developing effective restoration and conservation
   strategies. Here, we used ant communities to evaluate the effects of
   historical land uses (former agriculture or tree plantation) and current
   management (grazing, burning, mowing, and fertilizing) in subtropical
   grasslands. We also examined how ant species richness and composition
   are affected through changes in resource diversity and habitat
   structure. We classified 80 study sites in southern Brazil into two
   groups: permanent and secondary grasslands. Permanent grasslands
   presented high, medium or low management intensities that had never been
   under other land use. Secondary grasslands are former grasslands that
   were used for agriculture or pine plantations in the past, followed by
   passive restoration. We sampled ant communities with D-Vac suction in
   three multiplots per site in 2013-2015. We found that secondary
   grasslands had lower ant species diversity and different community
   composition than permanent grasslands. Ant diversity did not differ
   among permanent grasslands, but composition was markedly different,
   especially when comparing medium and high management intensities with
   low. Additionally, ant richness in secondary grasslands was mainly
   mediated by a decreased resource diversity (i.e., plant species
   richness) and grass cover, while burning and mowing management increased
   ant richness by increasing resource diversity. Our results indicate that
   passive recovery of grasslands in early successional stages after other
   land uses leads to incomplete recovery of ant communities, as important
   resource and structure-related drivers of ant species remain altered. In
   contrast, traditional management practices promote ant diversity.},

Title = {Natural regeneration of Pinus pinaster and Eucalyptus
   globulus from plantation into adjacent natural habitats},

Abstract = {The tree species used in planted forests are highly productive and have
   an important role in countries economy but the expansion of these trees
   into habitats outside plantations is a concern for managers and
   conservationists. Among the most planted forest species worldwide, we
   can find eucalypts and pines species. Understanding spatial patterns and
   the factors that influence these species colonization is crucial to
   increase the knowledge about expansion capability of these species and
   may help managers to improve and prioritize eventual control plans. Our
   study aimed to identify the recruitment spatial patterns of Pinus
   pinaster (native species) and Eucalyptus globulus (exotic species) into
   habitats surrounding plantations in Portugal (native forests, grasslands
   and shrublands) and to determine the factors that influence recruitment.
   This was done by looking at the recruitment success in several habitats
   near plantations, using a spatial gradient of distance to plantations
   edge. We observed as expected that the recruitment of P. pinaster and E.
   globulus decreased exponentially from the plantation edge. However, the
   higher P. pinaster seedling recruitment in this study (P. pinaster: 247
   seedlings/ha; E. globulus: 22 seedlings/ha), the smallest decline in
   seedlings density with distance from plantation boundary (P. pinaster =
   -0.036 seedlingsim vs E. globulus = -0.048 seedlings/m), and the longer
   distance of seedling establishment, demonstrate clearly that P. pinaster
   is more successful colonizing the habitats near plantations than E.
   globulus. Nevertheless E. globulus can growth seedlings within the
   planted stands suggesting that the species is becoming naturalized.
   However, localized recruitment (92\% of the total seedlings recorded
   were located less than 15 m from the plantation edge) and lower levels
   of establishment of E. globulus from managed plantations, suggested that
   this species did not demonstrate an invasive behavior. However, future
   research in abandoned eucalyptus plantation is needed to understand the
   role of plantation management and age as barriers to E. globulus
   colonization. Results from our survey revealed the suitability of all
   habitat types studied for P. pinaster natural regeneration, although
   their recruitment was more limited in forest habitat type. Forest and
   grassland were very resistant to E. globulus establishment. The two
   species recruitment was also influenced by different factors, with P.
   pinaster being independent of climatic variables, while E. globulus was
   affected by temperature seasonality and recruitment was found to be
   higher in areas with lower seasonal differences. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Title = {Testing species abundance distribution models in tropical forest
   successions: Implications for fine-scale passive restoration},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {135},
Pages = {28-35},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Tropical forests are recognized worldwide for providing ecosystem
   services that contribute greatly to biodiversity and ecosystem
   functioning. In this study, we hypothesize that tree species abundance
   distribution is determined by the commonness-rarity balance of species
   during tropical forest recovery through natural regeneration. We sampled
   45 20 m x 50 m plots across three sites in secondary forests with
   different stand ages (5, 10, 15, and 20 years) after shifting
   cultivation, and an old-growth forest (> 100 years old) located in the
   Northern Amazon forest, Venezuela. We explored the variations in woody
   species abundance distribution and compositional similarity using a
   chronosequence approach. There was a clear pattern of increasing species
   abundance in forest successions, from second-growth to old-growth
   forests. Species abundance in the old-growth forest was much higher than
   in the second-growth forest. The niche-preemption model showed a high
   goodnessof-fit to the 5-year old second-growth forest, while 10- and
   15-year old second-growth forests and the old-growth forest showed a
   significant fit to the lognormal model. Along the species-rank axis, the
   most common species accounted for 54\% of the total proportional
   abundance at the earliest successional stage (5-year old), whereas the
   relative proportion of the most common species remained relatively
   stable at 22\%-25\% in the following successional stages (i.e.,
   old-growth forest). Species dominance was lower in old-growth forest
   than those in second-growth forest, where there were seven species with
   the highest importance values within the community. There were obvious
   differences in relation to the old-growth forest, where rare species
   were present. The results we present here are crucial for designing and
   implementing proper, goal-oriented forest restoration strategies, and
   should aid future research.},

Abstract = {Restoration actions aimed at Mixed Ombrophilous Forests are limited due
   to the scarce knowledge about composition and structure of these
   communities on different successional stages, and also the effects of
   frequent disturbances on its dynamics, such as fire. The present work
   aimed at evaluating the effect of an accidental fire on the horizontal,
   vertical and diametric structure of an Araucaria angustifolia planted
   forest, located on Campos do Jordao State Park, SP, nine years after the
   disturbance. This study also intends to appraise the potential of these
   forests on inducing the secondary succession. Two Araucaria angustifolia
   forests were selected, with similar ages and environmental conditions,
   called Forests RI and Rh. On RI, there's no account of fire since its
   planting, in 1959 (control). RII, which was planted in 1958, was
   affected by an accidental fire in July 2001. During the upper strata
   survey (circumference at breast height (CBH) >= 15cm), 17 and 8
   permanent plots of 10x20m were established on forests RI and RII,
   respectively. In each one of these plots five sub-plots of 1x1m were
   randomly chosen, in order to survey the lower strata (total height >=
   30cm and CBH < 15cm). In forest RI, 836 trees and shrubs were surveyed,
   while on forest Rh I 175 individuals were sampled. Forest RI presented
   significantly higher values than II for density on both strata and
   dominance on upper strata (absolute totals). The diametric structure
   follows an inverted J-pattern in both areas. Nevertheless, the fire
   seems to significantly have reduced the number of individuals of the
   first diameter classes. Forest RII seems to still express the effect of
   burning, which was more severe in the lower strata; in case the above
   hypothesis is correct. However, due to favorable landscape conditions,
   we hope that both forests continue their natural succession, resembling
   the surrounding forest matrix in the long term.},

Abstract = {Vegetation indices are useful tools to remotely estimate several
   important parameters related to ecosystem functioning. However,
   improving and validating estimations for a wide range of vegetation
   types are necessary. In this study, we provide a methodology for the
   estimation of the leaf area index (LAI) in a tropical dry forest (TDF)
   using the light diffusion through the canopy as a function of the
   successional stage. For this purpose, we estimated the K coefficient, a
   parameter that relates the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI)
   to LAI, based on photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and solar
   radiation. The study was conducted in the Mata Seca State Park, in
   southeastern Brazil, from 2012 to 2013. We defined four successional
   stages (very early, early, intermediate, and late) and established one
   optical phenology tower at one plot of 20 x 20 m per stage. Towers
   measured the incoming and reflected solar radiation and PAR for NDVI
   calculation. For each plot, we established 24 points for LAI sampling
   through hemispherical photographs. Because leaf cover is highly seasonal
   in TDFs, we determined Delta K (leaf growth phase) and K (max) (leaf
   maturity phase). We detected a strong correlation between NDVI and LAI,
   which is necessary for a reliable determination of the K coefficient.
   Both NDVI and LAI varied significantly between successional stages,
   indicating sensitivity to structural changes in forest regeneration.
   Furthermore, the K values differed between successional stages and
   correlated significantly with other environmental variables such as air
   temperature and humidity, fraction of absorbed PAR, and soil moisture.
   Thus, we established a model based on spectral properties of the
   vegetation coupled with biophysical characteristics in a TDF that makes
   possible to estimate LAI from NDVI values. The application of the K
   coefficient can improve remote estimations of forest primary
   productivity and gases and energy exchanges between vegetation and
   atmosphere. This model can be applied to distinguish different
   successional stages of TDFs, supporting environmental monitoring and
   conservation policies towards this biome.},

Volume = {30},

Abstract = {Legal regulation related to restoration monitoring should be supported
   and validated by studies that evaluate the performance of indicators. In
   Brazil, a specific state regulation uses three indicators to attest
   recovery: ground cover with native vegetation (i.e. canopy cover, for
   tropical forest restoration projects) and density and richness of native
   plants spontaneously regenerating. Thus, we adopted other three
   ecological parameters: richness of zoochorous regenerant species (a
   functioning indicator linked to seed dispersal), the density of
   non-pioneer regenerants (a composition indicator), and dominance (a
   structure indicator), to test whether the indicators of the legal state
   monitoring protocol were associated to these more qualified indicators
   and we discussed the state protocol effectiveness. We evaluated 10 sites
   under restoration in the Atlantic Forest ranging from 9 to 45 years old
   and a reference area. Our results showed that the three indicators of
   the state monitoring protocol were associated to more qualified
   indicators in different restored sites and they can be considered
   proxies of ecological parameters to monitor and attest restoration
   success of tropical rainforest. In addition, dominance was strongly
   associated with richness of regenerants, but it was not associated to
   density, implying that richness and density of regenerants are not
   redundant and both should be monitored in the field. This kind of
   analysis could be usefully applied to define powerful and integrative
   indicators elsewhere, simplifying them without losing effectiveness as a
   means to stimulate wide adoption of monitoring protocols in the UN
   Decade on Ecosystem Restoration.},

Abstract = {Secondary forests (SFs) are one of the major carbons sinks in the
   Neotropics due to the rapid carbon assimilation in their above-ground
   biomass (AGB). However, the accurate contribution of SFs to the carbon
   cycle is a great challenge because of the uncertainty in AGB estimates.
   In this context, the main objective of this study is to explore full
   polarimetric Advanced Land Observing Satellite/Phased Array L-band
   Synthetic Aperture Radar-2 (ALOS/PALSAR-2) data to model SFs AGB in the
   Central Amazon. We carried out the forest inventory in 2014, measuring
   23 field plots. Supplementary land-use classification history was used
   to create 120 additional independent sample plots by adjusting growth
   curves using SFs age and previous land-use intensity from field plots
   and literature database. Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) analysis was
   performed to select the best model by corrected weighted Akaike
   Information Criterion (AICw) and validated by the leave-one-out
   bootstrapping method. The best-fitted model has six parameters and
   explained 65\% of the above-ground biomass variability. The prediction
   error was of Root Mean Square Error of the Prediction (RMSEP) = 8.8 +/-
   3.0 tonnes ha(-1) (8.8\%). The most explanatory variables for modelling
   secondary forest AGB were those that result from multiple scattering
   (Shannon Entropy), volumetric scattering (Bhattacharya decomposition),
   and double-bounce scattering (ratio VV/HH, vertically transmitted and
   received polarization/horizontally transmitted and received
   polarization). Including past-use of SF areas in the model with the
   Landsat time series classification, as the frequency of clear cuts and
   the number of years of active land-use before abandonment, the MLR has
   increased by 10\%, achieving 71\% of the variability explained by the
   model. The uncertainty report showed that ground truth AGB estimation
   (inventory, allometry, and plot expansion factors) might represent 50\%
   of the errors in the modelling estimation. In contrast, Synthetic
   Aperture Radar (SAR) inversion models (SAR error and regression) have
   achieved 20\%. The results showed that additional information on
   secondary forest land-use history could improve the performance of AGB
   recovery models, as well as can be used to expand the sampling units on
   tropical forests.},

Journal = {RESTORATION ECOLOGY},

Volume = {31},
Number = {8},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Broad-scale parameters are crucial for the restoration of forest to
   align with the United Nations resolutions for the ``Decade on Ecosystem
   Restoration.{''} Direct seeding is a moderately priced, active method
   with potential use in forest recovery. This study evaluated the recovery
   of woody vegetation from 23 restored forests (RF) located on the
   southern edge of the Brazilian Amazon, a region known as the ``Arc of
   Deforestation{''}. We ask: (1) What are the differences in abundance,
   species richness, and alpha diversity between seeded and regenerated
   species in RF? (2) How does the structure, floristic composition,
   species richness, and alpha diversity of RF compare with adjacent
   primary forests (PF)? After 12 years of intervention, our results reveal
   that RFs exhibited lower species richness, alpha diversity, aboveground
   biomass (AGB), basal area, and dissimilar floristic composition when
   compared to PFs. Recovery in PFs reached 40\% for AGB, 55\% for basal
   area, 24\% for alpha diversity, and 60\% for species richness. These
   findings indicate ongoing recovery of evaluated parameters, highlighting
   the success of the seeding method in restoring degraded riparian
   forests. We also observed similar species richness between seeded and
   regenerated species in RFs, yet absolute density, AGB, and alpha
   diversity were higher in seeded species. The notable presence of
   non-seeded species in our plots provides evidence that direct seeding
   fosters spontaneous regeneration from the regional species pool. Our
   findings suggest that direct seeding is a viable option for restoring
   forest structure and diversity in areas with limited or no potential for
   passive regeneration.},

Abstract = {A substantial share of the remaining tropical forest cover is
   represented by historically degraded fragments exposed to severe edge
   effects, where ruderal plants proliferate vigorously and may arrest
   succession. We tested climber plant cutting as strategy to restore a
   semideciduous tropical forest remnant that is dominated by ruderal
   climbers. We compared control (unmanaged) plots with plots subjected to
   climber cutting at 1-m height with recutting one (after 8 months) or
   three times (8, 24 and 36 months). We monitored: 1) tree and shrub
   biomass gain and canopy openness for three years; 2) tree and shrub
   growth and recruitment of regenerating seedlings for one year; and 3)
   planted seedling survival for two years. Climber cutting increased
   biomass gain by similar to 51\% for smaller trees and shrubs (1.58 <=
   dbh < 5 cm) only, regardless of the number of re-cuts. Canopy openness
   increased following climber cutting, but recovered after ten months due
   to rapid growth of the tree canopies. Growth of regenerating seedlings,
   but not abundance, was favored by climber cutting. Initial cutting of
   climbers enhanced survival of enrichment plantings, but this benefit
   declined with canopy re-occupation by tree foliage. Although longer-term
   research is needed, cutting ruderal climbers in degraded forest remnants
   was shown to be a promising approach to enhance forest regeneration and
   carbon sequestration, justifying its consideration in the restoration
   agenda as a complementary activity to increasing forest cover in former
   agricultural lands. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Woody biomass accumulation in a Cerrado of Central Brazil monitored for
   27 years after the implementation of silvicultural systems},
Journal = {FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {455},
Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {The Brazilian Cerrado is the second largest biome in Brazil, and its
   natural landscapes have undergone transformations, due in large part to
   anthropic activities. However, little is known about the effects of
   these activities on the natural regeneration of Cerrado vegetation.
   Thus, the objective of this study was to evaluate the accumulation of
   woody biomass in an area of a Cerrado sensu stricto that was monitored
   for 27 years after the implementation of six silvicultural systems.
   A period of 17 years was sufficient for the woody community of the
   Cerrado sensu stricto to naturally recover its original stock of aerial
   biomass after the application of silvicultural systems. A Few woody
   species contribute to the total aerial biomass accumulated over time,
   and such contribution is variable with time and with the type of
   silvicultural system.
   At 27 years after cutting, the largest fraction of biomass accumulated
   in the area were represented by the species Miconia leucocarpa,
   Blepharocalyx salicifolius, Schefflera macroccupa, Qualea grandiflora,
   Dalbergia Miscolobium, Eriotheca pubescens, Qualea parviflora and
   Caryocar Brasiliense, which also demonstrated higher fire resistance.
   A period of 17 years after the implementation of silvicultural systems
   is considered sufficient for an area to recover naturally to the
   original stock of woody biomass at the community level. This result
   causes a greater reduction in the biomass of fire-sensitive species and
   transforms a Cerrado from a carbon sink into a source of CO2 emissions
   to the atmosphere.},

Title = {The evolving role of Bertholletia excelsa in Amazonia:
   contributing to local livelihoods and forest conservation},
Journal = {DESENVOLVIMENTO E MEIO AMBIENTE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {48},
Number = {SI},
Pages = {477-497},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {In the last three decades, Brazil nut (Bertholletia excelsa) has emerged
   as a cornerstone species for Amazonia. This has gone hand-in-hand with
   the creation of extractive reserves, an alternative land use model to
   balance biodiversity conservation with rural development, whereby
   traditional forest residents are assigned legal responsibility for
   co-management of these reserves and their resources, including Brazil
   nut. The essential role of this species in conservation and local
   livelihoods has precipitated a shift from general exploitation to more
   conscious, intensive management. Drawing heavily on our more than 25
   years of research in the Brazilian state of Acre and the larger body of
   B. excelsa research across the Amazon basin, we ask: (1) Are Brazil nut
   harvests sustainable in terms of fruit production patterns and
   resilience to nut (seed) collection? (2) In what ways might production
   be augmented and nut quality enhanced? We highlight that scientific
   evidence and local knowledge indicate that current levels of nut
   harvests are compatible with sustaining populations of B. excelsa and
   its key seed disperser, Dasyprocta spp. Rather than concentrating on the
   fate of most seeds produced, the more pressing risk to B. excelsa
   populations is survival of existing large trees. Moreover, ample
   knowledge indicates possible futures to increase productivity by
   protecting and improving conditions of these large trees. Cutting lianas
   from host tree crowns dramatically improves productivity over time.
   Additional promising ways to grow Brazil nut-rich forests include: (1)
   Search and map previously unharvested productive trees located beyond
   traditional collection trails, (2) Tend new recruits, particularly in
   abandoned swidden fallows, and (3) Conduct enrichment plantings to
   establish small-scale intensive groves. Upgraded drying, storage and
   processing have led to dramatic improvements in nut quality and market
   access over the last 30 years. The growing knowledge base and diverse
   management interventions examined help promote Brazil nut sustainability
   and maintain its critical role in conserving Amazonian forests.},

Volume = {5},
Number = {12},
Pages = {3022-3030},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Negotiation, reconciliation of multiple scales through both ecological
   and social dimensions and minimization of power imbalances are
   considered critical challenges to overcome for effective governance of
   forest restoration. Finding the right mix of ``command and control{''}
   in forest restoration vs. ``environmental governance{''}, which includes
   non-state actors, regulatory flexibility, and market based instruments
   is at the heart of these challenges. This Special Issue attempts at
   shedding light on these challenges with case studies from South and
   Central America, Africa, and Asia. Some provide within-country as well
   as cross-country comparisons. A few others present case studies at the
   household level. Both policy and legal constraints towards implementing
   forest restoration are also discussed as a function of top down vs.
   bottom up approaches. The effectiveness of payments for environmental
   services is examined as catalyzers of forest restoration initiatives.
   Finally, two papers deal with the legal and policy constraints in making
   restoration through natural regeneration a viable and cost-effective
   tool. In the face of renewed perspectives for expanding forest
   restoration programs globally, governance issues will likely play a key
   role in eventually determining success. As many of the papers in this
   Special Issue suggest, the fate of forest restoration outcomes is, more
   often than not, associated with overall governance challenges, some of
   which are often overlooked particularly across multiple scales.},

   fragments},
Journal = {ZOOLOGIA},
Year = {2012},

Pages = {515-530},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Arthropods are the most diverse and abundant group of animals found in
   tropical lowland forests, and in light of ongoing global change
   phenomena, it is essential to better understand their responses to
   anthropogenic disturbances. Here we present a review of arthropod
   responses to forest deforestation and fragmentation based on studies
   conducted at the Biological Dynamics of Forest Fragments Project
   (BDFFP), located in central Amazonia. These studies involved a wide
   range of arthropod groups. All but one of the studies evaluated changes
   in total species number or species density in relation to fragment size,
   (i.e. area effects), and one-third also evaluated edge effects. Our
   review indicates that almost every arthropod group studied showed some
   kind of response to reduction in forest area, including altered
   abundances, species richness or composition in comparisons of
   different-sized fragments, fragmented and non-fragmented areas, or
   comparisons of forest edges and forest interiors. These responses tended
   to be idiosyncratic, with some groups showing predicted declines in
   abundance or diversity in the fragments while others show no response or
   even increases. However, some of the observed effects on arthropods, or
   on the ecological processes in which they are involved, were transient.
   The most likely explanation for this was the rapid development of
   secondary growth around fragments, which greatly increased the
   connectivity between fragments and the remaining forest. Although the
   BDFFP has provided many insights regarding the effects of forest
   fragmentation on arthropod assemblages, many diverse groups, such as
   canopy arthropods, have received scant attention. For those that have
   been studied, much remains to be learned regarding the long-term
   dynamics of these assemblages and how landscape context influences local
   biodiversity. The BDFFP remains an exceptional site in which to
   investigate how the ecological interactions in which arthropods are
   engaged are altered in fragmented landscapes.},

Title = {Soil factors rather than stand age drive tree phylogenetic diversity
   along Amazon Forest succession},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {189},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Understanding the phylogenetic diversity and structure of woody
   communities can explain how deterministic or stochastic processes drive
   a forest community assembly. This study assessed the tree community's
   phylogenetic diversity and structure during secondary succession after
   shifting cultivation (SC) in the Northern Amazon Forest. We hypothesized
   that soil-mediated filtering, rather than habitat filtering based on
   stand age and neutrality-based stochastic processes, determines
   phylogenetic diversity and structure of woody community along Amazon
   Forest succession after SC. We used forest inventory data from 45 plots
   across three sites repre-senting second-growth forests (SG) having stand
   ages after shifting cultivation (e.g., 5, 10, 15, and 20 years old) and
   an old-growth reference forest (> 100 years old, OG). We tested
   different linear mixed-effects models to determine the main effects of
   soil-mediated filtering (i.e., nutrients and soil texture) and stand age
   on phylo-genetic metrics. Phylogenetic diversity (PD) showed a
   significant difference between SG and OG: the highest PD was found in
   OG, whereas the lowest PD was found during the initial successional
   stage. We found a trend of phylogenetic structure promoted by soil
   attributes; the variability of soil texture mainly explained most of the
   variation of phylogenetic diversity and structure. Stand age did not
   demonstrate a significant influence on phylogenetic metrics across any
   of the tested models. Higher soil fertility may favor the growth of
   species from multiple distant clades, increasing phylogenetic diversity
   and reducing phylogenetic clustering. However, SC may affect the
   fertility content in silt soils of OG and generate soils with a high
   proportion of sand and low fertility in SG. Thus, our study demonstrates
   that soil-mediated abiotic filtering shapes the phylogenetic structure
   and diversity of tree communities along Amazon forest succession due to
   deterministic processes rather than stand age and neutrality-based
   stochastic processes.},

Abstract = {In natural regeneration, vegetation goes through different stages over
   time, each of them with different conditions to drain the precipitated
   water to the soil surface. The aim of this study was to evaluate
   interception loss, throughfall, stemflow and surface runoff in early and
   advanced stages regeneration at evergreen rainforest subtype sites
   within the Atlantic Forest, located in the Serra do Itajai National
   Park, in southern Brazil. Rainfall was sampled by three rain gauges and
   throughfall was measured using ``U{''} type gutters. The stemflow was
   measured in 24 trees per stage (i.e., 48 trees in total). The
   interception loss was calculated as the difference between rainfall and
   the sum of the throughfall plus stemflow. The surface runoff was
   evaluated using metal rails. Vegetation in the initial stage is a
   composition of 7 species with a basal area of 5.01 m2.ha-1 and advanced
   stage site consists of 28 species with a basal area of 34.7 m2.ha-1.
   Throughfall records were 81.7\% in the initial and 74.1\% in the
   advanced regeneration stages. The stemflows registered were 5.93\% in
   the initial stage and 0.54\% in the advanced stage while the
   interception losses were respectively 13.2\% and 25.8\%. Surface runoffs
   observations were 11.1\% in the initial stage and 10.7\% in the advanced
   stage. Statistically significant differences were found between the
   regeneration stages for the stemflow and for the interception loss
   parameters. The study showed that, for some hydrological processes, the
   behavior of the precipitated water differs for the stage of vegetation
   regeneration. The regeneration stage does not influence the surface
   runoff, demonstrating that after a few years of vegetation regeneration,
   this hydrological process is equivalent to vegetation in an advanced
   stage.},

   abundance and richness in abandoned and planted pastures in Southeastern
   Brazil},
Journal = {APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {203},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The ecological restoration of pastures is a complex process, as these
   sites may suffer from degraded soil quality and reduced abundance and
   diversity of invertebrates. Nevertheless, their restoration can
   contribute to the return of essential ecosystem services, making them an
   important research area. To better understand the initial process of
   soil restoration in tropical pastures, we examined soil microbial
   activity, litter invertebrate abundance and species richness across a
   land-use gradient in southeastern Brazil. This gradient included a
   pasture in continuous use (PCU), three 5-year-old moderately assisted
   recovery (MAR) and unassisted natural recovery (UNR) pastures, and a
   reference forest (REF). We hypothesized that, owing to soil preparation
   and enhanced structural complexity, MAR (planted) sites would exhibit
   higher microbial activity and support a more diverse and abundant
   invertebrate population than UNR (naturally regenerating) sites. We also
   predicted that the MAR and REF sites would foster higher soil quality,
   tree species richness, and tree abundance, accounting for most of the
   variation in microbial activity and litter invertebrates. Contrary to
   our hypotheses, the UNR sites showed slightly better levels of microbial
   activity than the MAR sites, and PCU exhibited the highest levels of
   microbial biomass carbon, microbial respiration, and beta-glucosidase.
   The MAR and UNR sites were similar in terms of invertebrate abundance
   and richness, both showing total abundance and taxonomic group numbers
   comparable to those of REF. We found no correlation between microbial
   activity and vegetation or soil quality. Only Thysanoptera and Hemiptera
   invertebrate groups showed a weak association with litter production and
   soil quality. Our findings suggest that site preparation for tree
   planting, which is indispensable for areas lacking natural regeneration
   potential, appears to temporarily disrupt the soil conditions. This
   implies a longer recovery period for the microbial activity. However,
   this is not a drawback of tree planting but rather an integral part of
   the process that contributes to long-term ecosystem restoration.
   Vegetation variables and general soil quality may have an indirect
   effect on microbial activity and litter invertebrates. It would be
   beneficial to consider additional variables to gain a more comprehensive

Abstract = {This study aimed to evaluate stump regrowth and estimate the
   reconstitution of shrub-tree biomass from the stumps in an area of
   Caatinga under forest management in Floresta-PE, Brazil. The
   circumferences and heights of the stump and sprouts were measured two
   years after an intervention on 18 plots. The influence of the stump
   diameter and its height on the sprouting ability of the species was
   evaluated. Data was taken in the next area without intervention in order
   to estimate the diameter at breast height for reconstitution of the
   exploited biomass. We found that the tillering for Poincianella
   bracteosa and Aspidosperma pyrifolium was influenced by the size of the
   circumference, but not by the stump height. The average estimated
   biomass (17186.16 kg ha(-1)) was similar to other areas also subject to
   human intervention, and its reconstitution can be an auxiliary tool for
   monitoring illegal deforestation by environmental agencies.},

Title = {Temporal monitoring of ecological restoration by applied nucleation: A
   case study in the Pampa, southern Brazil},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {212},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Temporal monitoring of ecological restoration projects in the Pampa
   biome is still inadequate, with a gap in the knowledge of the
   successional trajectory of riparian forests under active restoration.
   Thus, monitoring of these areas based on a set of ecological indicators
   is crucial to assess the effectiveness of the restoration, as well as to
   ascertain the current state of the restoration project and the need for
   adaptive management actions. In this study, the progression of the
   techniques of planting in nuclei and passive restoration was
   investigated using ecological indicators. The study was carried out in
   the Serra do Sudeste, in an area of riparian forest. The region belongs
   to the Pampa biome, southern Brazil. The evaluations took place in two
   different monitoring periods, the first in 2018 and the second in 2021,
   in two areas, one under restoration by applied nucleation and the other
   under passive restoration. Ecological indicators of composition,
   structure, and function were measured, sampled in 10 plots through
   monitoring per area. The results showed significant differences between
   the monitoring periods in each area by the Kruskal-Wallis test (p <
   0.05). The areas presented differences in floristic composition between
   monitoring periods by non-metric scaling analysis (nMDS), and
   differences in species contribution by similarity percentage analysis
   (SIMPER). The dendrometric variables (height, diameter, breast height,
   nuclei area, and crown area) presented a significant difference by the
   Kruskal-Wallis test (p < 0.05) in the evaluation of the development of
   the nuclei. The ecological indicators of structure (canopy cover, soil
   cover by litter and trees) and functionality (biotic dispersal syndrome)
   were statistically higher in the second monitoring period in the area
   under restoration by applied nucleation. In the area under passive
   restoration, the indicators of structure (litter thickness and soil
   cover by litter and trees) and functionality (biotic dispersal syndrome)
   were also statistically higher in the second monitoring period. In both
   areas, Baccharis dracunculifolia DC. was the species that most
   contributed to the floristic dissimilarity between the monitoring
   moments. In the development of the nuclei, the dendrometric variables
   were statistically superior in the second monitoring period, pointing to
   progression in the development of the nuclei. It is concluded that the
   restoration technique by applied nucleation is effective in the studied
   area, as the nuclei progress over time. The area under passive
   restoration showed signs of changes in ecological succession. The study
   result provide support for the improvement in future restoration
   projects for riparian areas in the Pampa biome.},

Abstract = {The landscapes are highly dependent on the dynamics of local land use
   and land cover, which directly affects landscape structure and
   determines the spatial patterns of forest patches, as well as to the
   major land uses within a specific region. The calculation of landscape
   metrics can support the understanding of such spatial distribution. In
   this study, 16 landscape metrics were analyzed in a drainage watershed
   in a high relief region in the Rio de Janeiro state, Southeastern
   Brazil, with the aim to evaluate the use of landscape metrics as
   indicators for agricultural management. Metrics calculation was followed
   by a Principal Component Analysis, which indicated the metrics that were
   most effective in evidencing the landscape structure in analysis. The
   results showed that the late-succession forest is the dominant component
   in the landscape. This class also presented the highest MPS metric
   value, related to the mean patch size by class. Some PCA results suggest
   that the metrics association was less effective in clustering the
   overgrown pasture, clean pasture, and annual crops classes, but this
   could result from the intrinsic association among those classes, by crop
   rotation, meaning the abandon of a site formerly occupied by an annual
   crop. Some metrics better suggested an interaction among land use
   classes and have potential to be use in the analyses of agricultural
   landscapes in high relief sites.},

Abstract = {This article examines transformations associated with changes in
   resource use and land cover dynamics in the community of Sao Manoel,
   Maranhao state, in the eastern Brazilian Amazon. The shifting cultivator
   peasants in Sao Manoel integrate swidden fields for annual cropping, the
   extraction of babassu palm products, and pastures for cattle ranching.
   Since the early twentieth century, predominant vegetative cover patterns
   have been altered from species-rich mature forests to secondary
   succession with babassu dominant to pasture or swidden fields containing
   palm stands of various densities. A grounded political ecology of
   resource use in the area suggests that management strategies and the
   resulting land cover dynamics integrate site-specific decisions of
   peasant producers. I discuss the trajectory of production strategies in
   Sao Manoel since the establishment of the community in the 1920s, and
   identify the multiple dimensions affecting resource use and
   environmental outcomes, with an emphasis on the period following land
   struggles and the recovery of peasant tenure rights in the mid-1980s.
   The analysis indicates that socionatural trajectories that optimize
   resource use and address the socioeconomic needs of the community
   include the maintenance of palm/pastures associations.},

Abstract = {Forest restoration has been proposed as a scalable nature-based solution
   to achieve global environmental and socio-economic outcomes and is
   central to many policy initiatives, such as the Bonn Challenge. Restored
   forests contain appreciable biodiversity, improve habitat connectivity
   and sequester carbon. Incentive mechanisms (e.g. payments for ecosystem
   services and allocation of management rights) have been a focus of
   forest restoration efforts for decades. Yet, there is still little
   understanding of their role in promoting restoration success. We
   conducted a systematic literature review to investigate how incentive
   mechanisms are used to promote forest restoration, outcomes, and the
   biophysical and socio-economic factors that influence implementation and
   program success. We found that socio-economic factors, such as
   governance, monitoring systems and the experience and beliefs of
   participants, dominate whether or not an incentive mechanism is
   successful. We found that approximately half of the studies report both
   positive ecological and socio-economic outcomes. However, reported
   adverse outcomes were more commonly socio-economic than ecological. Our
   results reveal that achieving forest restoration at a sufficient scale
   to meet international commitments will require stronger assessment and
   management of socio-economic factors that enable or constrain the
   success of incentive mechanisms.This article is part of the theme issue
   `Understanding forest landscape restoration: reinforcing scientific
   foundations for the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration'.},

Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},

Abstract = {Natural regeneration has been considered an important strategy for
   improving large-scale forest restoration to revert the losses resulting
   from the fragmentation of tropical landscapes in recent years. However,
   local, regional, and spatial factors can influence the dynamics of
   regeneration, thereby affecting its efficiency. We investigated how time
   after disturbance, landscape characteristics, and climate gradients
   affect the efficiency of natural regeneration in the Brazilian Atlantic
   Forest. We searched for studies that addressed the post-logging
   regenerating of forests throughout the biome. For each included study,
   we extracted the forest age, species richness, and basal area (used as
   an estimate of carbon). Additionally, for each studied site (total 100
   sites) we used land use maps to extract the landscape metrics and
   obtained bioclimatic variables from the global dataset. Further, we used
   forest age, landscape metrics, and bioclimatic variables to build models
   and predict forest species richness and carbon stock. Our results showed
   that species richness was positively affected by habitat amount
   (evaluated through patch area and perimeter-area ratio), isothermality,
   and forest age. Carbon stock was positively affected only by the forest
   age. These findings show that natural regeneration will yield the best
   results in terms of conserving the biodiversity among landscapes with a
   large number of habitats. Conversely, a landscape with a predominance of
   mature forest will be more efficient as carbon stock. We conclude that,
   when planning the restoration of large-scale landscapes, natural
   regeneration must be considered along with other strategies to ensure
   that multiple objectives are achieved.},

   the species, both in laboratories and nurseries or in field studies on
   the ecology of this species. Special attention can be given to dry
   fruit, and the embryo, the epigeal phanerocotylar germination and the
   presence of aculei in the young stages (plantules and seedlings) are
   important for species identification. The characters that are common to

Abstract = {Although flooding and the highly dynamic geomorphology influence
   ecophysiology of trees in Amazonian white-water forests (varzea),
   information about the extent of these environmental conditions on
   distribution and richness of tree species is scarce. To better
   understand dynamic of natural forest succession and the development of
   different varzea forest types, we inventoried structure and floristic
   composition of trees greater than or equal to10 cm DBH in a total area
   of 5.24 ha in varzea forests near Tefe and near Manaus. Brazilian
   Amazon. The forests were of different successional stages and situated
   on different sites along the flood-level gradient. Topography and
   average inundation of all inventoried trees was measured with a
   theodolite. Sedimentation was recorded during the aquatic phase 2000 and
   the soil texture in each site determined.
   The low-varzea forests were composed of different successional stages
   subjected to annual floods between 7 and 3 m. Stand density per hectare
   averaged 490 individuals in the early successional stage, up to 1000
   individuals in the early secondary stage and 434 individuals in the late
   successional stage, species richness amounted to 4,45 and 91 tree
   species, respectively. The high-varzea forests were late successional
   stages subjected to annual inundations above 3 in. Stand density per
   hectare averaged 407 individuals and species richness amounted to 68
   species in a frequently exploited forest near Manaus and to 172 species
   in a undisturbed forest near Tefe.
   Species richness and distribution along the gradients of flooding and
   sedimentation was well defined. Only 2.6\% of 222 recorded tree species
   occurred over the whole flood-level gradient. Sedimentation was highest
   in the early successional stages near the slip-off slopes of the
   main-river channels, and decreased with increasing topographic level of
   the forested sites and proceeding succession, reaching lowest rates in
   the high-varzea forests. Simultaneously, soil texture changed from
   coarse-grained soils in early stages to fine-grained soils in subsequent
   stages. Thus, natural succession in varzea forests is linked to the
   biogenical induced silting up of the sites, because dunes and large
   stems building trees slow down water energy and favour the deposition of
   fine grained sediment. A special vegetation unit within the low varzea
   is the `chavascal', a species-poor swamp forest, which establishes in
   the marginal zone of lakes or in ancient silted up river arms. Since it
   is located off the direct influence of the main-river channels, it seems
   to be characterised by longstanding stable environmental conditions, and
   therefore cannot rank with the successional sequence near the highly
   dynamic river systems. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {This study aimed to characterize of the Stryphnodendron adstringens
   (Mart.) Coville population to verify the viability of sustainable
   management in area of Savanna in the north of state Minas Gerais, Brazil
   country. Therefore inventoried 25 plots of 400 square meters in two
   places, in all was inventoried one hectare in each places. Was measured
   all adults individuals with diameter at breast height the 1,30 meter
   (DBH) <= 3 centimeter of barbatimao. In these plots was measured the
   diameter (DBH) and height (H) and subsequently for each site was
   evaluated: the De Liocourt quotient (q), basal area (G) and vertical
   stratification. The outcome showed a density of 180 and 218, mean
   diameters of 7,38 and 6,26 meters, mean of `q' of 2,22 and 1,50 and
   means heights of 2,93 and 3,10 meters in two site respectively. The
   quotient' De Liocourt showed imbalance in the recruitment in some
   classes of Site two. Although the imbalance indicated by `q', the
   diameter distribution behaved exponentially negative as expected for
   native forests in the process of secondary succession. The Observed a
   more concentration of individuals in the middle stratum with 142 and 154
   individuals in each site respectively. The conclusion this work that is
   although the species has distinct structure, on both sites studied the
   population of the barbatimao is constituted for a great number of
   diameter small individuals and with exclusivity of middle vertical
   stratum. The regenerative capacity of the specie, density height of the
   individuals per hectare and the horizontal and vertical structure show
   that there is viability to manage of the barbatimao on both sites since
   that their structures is maintained balanced.},

Abstract = {Environment and plant interactions are important drivers of forest
   community assembly and dynamics. This study explored how forest dynamics
   influence the phylogenetic structure of Tropical Atlantic Forests. We
   hypothesized that: (a) maximum diameter and maximum height are conserved
   traits within the phylogenetic lineages; (b) the set of dead large trees
   are more closely related to the set of living large trees than expected
   by chance; (c) mortality, recruitment and biomass variation are related
   to phylogenetic effects. We gathered data from 12,920 trees with
   diameter (DBH) >= 3.2 cm, from nine sites, distributed among seasonal
   semideciduous submontane forests, evergreen dense forests and gallery
   forests in Brazil. With this data we computed annual dynamic rates
   (mortality, recruitment, loss and gain of basal area), phylogenetic
   turnover and phylogenetic distance between dead and surviving trees, and
   recruits and surviving trees, within distinct size (DBH) classes. We
   found an overall tendency for higher mortality than recruitment, and
   higher gain than loss of basal area. Concomitantly, we detected an
   increase of phylogenetic clustering caused by exclusion of distant
   relatives, and a phylogenetic overdispersion among large trees (>= 30 cm
   DBH) caused by exclusion of close relatives. We also observed high
   values of phylogenetic distance among recruits and surviving trees
   across different size classes. As the maximum height and maximum
   diameter are conserved functional traits, these findings indicate that
   negative interactions such as competition-like effects among large trees
   influence the phylogenetic structure and the forest dynamics, meanwhile
   successional change continuously excludes unfit phylogenetic lineages
   while recruits fit phylogenetic lineages.},

Title = {Toward a forest transition across the Brazilian Atlantic Forest biome},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN FORESTS AND GLOBAL CHANGE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {6},
Month = {JUN 29},
Abstract = {The world has entered the United Nations Decade on Ecosystem Restoration
   (2021-2030), yet many regions of the world still face environmental
   degradation. In this context a question arises: under what conditions
   may a given region shift from a trajectory of environmental degradation
   to environmental recovery? Answering this question constitutes an
   important endeavor for the scientific community, policymakers, and
   organizations leading the planning and implementation of restoration
   projects. This study examines some of the human-environment conditions
   underpinning the net gains in natural forest cover in a region that has
   experienced environmental degradation: the Atlantic Forest biome,
   Brazil. Using land-use/cover (LULC) data, we assessed the loss and
   successive gain in forest cover during the 1987-2001 and 2001-2015
   periods. Municipality-level statistics on agriculture and economy,
   together with LULC and biophysical data, were used to develop models for
   assessing forest cover trajectories. Of the 1,972 municipalities
   experiencing net forest loss during the 1987-2001 period, 59\% shifted
   their trajectory to a net gain during the 2001-2015 period. This shift,
   known as forest transition, followed a complex socio-economic pathway
   characterized by (i) the stagnation of traditional agricultural
   activities favoring the replacement of pasturelands by mechanized
   agriculture, and (ii) the emergence of non-agricultural rural activities
   together with multifunctional landscapes. Furthermore, a trend of
   decrease in precipitation seems to be associated with land abandonment,
   thus, favoring the return of natural vegetation. Our findings suggest
   that forest transition at the biome level is possible if environmental
   and land regulations take advantage of specific context-dependent
   situations that foster net forest gains.},

Abstract = {Ant diversity is influenced by the structural complexity of the
   environment. Ants are thus an ecologically important group due to their
   potential to serve as indicators of environmental quality. The objective
   of this study was to evaluate ant diversity in areas with different land

   Permanent Preservation Area of the Foz do Chapeco Hydroelectric Plant
   reservoir. Ant assemblies among sample sites were compared using
   rarefaction analysis, and estimated richness, frequency of occurrence,
   and relative abundance were calculated. Associations between species and
   sample sites were evaluated using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). We
   identified 55 species in total from 24 genera, distributed among seven
   subfamilies. Eight species had positive associations with sample sites.
   Estimates indicated that ant richness may be up to 21.4\% greater than
   that observed. This study presents an inventory of species capable of
   colonizing environments undergoing natural regeneration processes, and
   aids our understanding of ecological recovery dynamics in protected

   Projects: Challenges and Solutions},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The revegetation of steep slopes after mining and infrastructure
   projects is not an easy task. To enhance the effectiveness of
   revegetation projects, the present study aimed to review (i) specific
   challenges of steep slope revegetation, (ii) ecological succession
   patterns in similar environments, (iii) soil conditioning and
   revegetation strategies to enhance vegetation cover, (iv) the importance
   of microorganisms to enhance steep slope revegetation, and (v) the
   functional plant traits necessary to establish on steep slopes. In
   general, steep slopes are characterized by high bulk densities,
   potentially toxic elements, and low water and nutrient availability.
   Additionally, high temperature and elevated radiation constrain the soil
   conditioning and vegetation cover establishment. Lessons from ecological
   succession in natural steep slope habitats show that steep slope
   revegetation is a long-term process. Planting strategies, including
   hydroseeding and geotextiles, may enhance the implementation of
   vegetation cover. Different plant functional groups show adaptations
   necessary for establishment in steep slope environments, and mixtures of
   species containing different functional groups can promote diverse and
   resilient plant communities. Promising species may be retrieved from
   local rupestrian ecosystems, as these floras are adapted to shallow,
   oligotrophic soils. Further research on combining methods of soil
   conditioning with individual planting and/or seeding strategies of
   carefully selected species is necessary to enhance steep slope
   revegetation and rehabilitation, contributing to slope stability,
   erosion reduction, and carbon fixation in the long term.},

Abstract = {Recent studies of Swietenia macrophylla King argue that natural
   regeneration of this highly valued tree is episodic and occurs only
   after infrequent catastrophic disturbance. An analysis of 14 population
   size-distributions in natural forests shows that population structure
   varies across this species' range. In forests that are in successional
   transition from open deciduous forest to evergreen forest there is often
   prolific regeneration. We show that in this type of forest in southern
   Para (Brazil) patches of even-sized trees are small. Large-scale
   disturbance may be necessary for regeneration only in evergreen forests
   where little light penetrates through the canopy. The transition zone
   between evergreen and deciduous forest in Para is moving south, and we
   propose that mahogany populations to the north are in the process of
   competitive exclusion. Sustainable harvesting of mahogany must take
   account of the successional stage of the forest.},

Journal = {ACTA OECOLOGICA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {100},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {We tested the hypothesis that topographic/soil gradient and ecological
   succession are the main factors driving the high tree diversity in a
   protected area in Amazonia/Cerrado transition. The gradient is a slope
   composed by savanna-like vegetation of rocky cerrado on the top, typical
   and dense savanna cerrado in the middle, and cerradao ecotonal forest in
   the bottom. The ecological succession is a result of Cerrado
   encroachment when protected from fire. The cerradao and dense cerrado
   were associated to higher values of clay, silt, Mg and organic matter,
   whereas the typical and rocky cerrado were the opposite, with highest
   sand, altitude and Al. The PCA analysis revealed 73\% of the influence
   of such habitat conditions in the species distribution along the slope.
   The most important determinants of species distribution are the
   topography and soil properties, specially texture, organic matter and
   concentrations of Mg. The species richness was higher in the dense and
   typical cerrado (intermediate slope), probably due to the mutual
   influence of the top flora of rocky cerrado and the lower gradient flora
   of cerradao. The influences of topography and soil texture is probably
   related to the water availability, where the sandy soil and full
   drainage in the top of the slope provide less water supply to the
   vegetation (rocky cerrado) compared to the bottom (cerradao). Patches of
   fire-protected Cerrado encroachment are common in Bacaba Park, with
   forest and savanna species coexisting. The substitutions of species
   across space and time, corroborates our hypothesis about the
   successional and topographic/edaphic variations acting as the main
   determinant of high tree diversity in the protected area.},

   revegetation on one half of the area with a high density of planting
   tree species, and on the other half remained natural regeneration
   (control). In 2000, each half were randomly deployed three installments
   of 25 m(2) containing four tapered litter collectors, with the intake
   monitored for a year. In the laboratory the collected material was
   sorted, oven dried and quantified its mass. With six years, the
   revegetation deployed in degraded area was effective in promoting an
   increase in the supply of plant biomass and reproductive propagules,
   which demonstrates the existence of barriers to natural regeneration and
   the need for human intervention to reverse old degrading practices.},

Abstract = {The study was conducted at the Mata dos Godoy State Park in Londrina,
   state of Parana, Brazil. Baited pitfall traps were installed in the
   forest, in adjacent abandoned pasture land, and on the borders between
   these two environments. Every two weeks, from June 1999 to May 2000, the
   traps were placed for 24 hours and the material was collected every 12
   hours. The 4687 specimens of Scarabaeinae collected belong to 13 genera
   and 27 species. The most frequent species were Onthophagus catharinensis
   (Paulian, 1936) (22.1\%), Onthophagus hirculus (Mannerhein, 1829)
   (20.1\%), Dichotomius mormon (Ljungh, 1799) (13.1\%), Sulcophanaeus
   menelas (Laporte, 1840) (12.8\%), and Eurystemus parallelus (Dalman,
   1824) (10.6\%). The other species collected amounted to less than 4.7\%.
   The difference in numbers of specimens collected in the three
   environments was not significant (K-(2.72) = 0.63, p = 0.729). The
   distribution patterns of species composition for the different
   environments (ANOSIM R = 0.29, p < 0.01) and activity periods (ANOSIM R
   = 0.18, p < 0.01) were different. Sulcophanaeus menelas, Canthidium aff.
   trinodosum, O. hirculus, and E. parallelus were the most abundant
   species, being predominantly diurnal; the first three species were more
   active on abandoned pasture. Most of the Dichothomius
   assifer(Eschscholtz, 1822) and D. mormon specimens were captured at
   night. The latter species was the most abundant in edges, whereas D.
   assifer, Scybalochantum aff. zischkai, and O. catharinensis can be
   considered bioindicators because they were either exclusively or highly
   predominant in the best preserved areas. A larger number of individuals
   was observed from December 1999 through March 2000, which is the time of
   the year when adults of Scarabaeinae normally emerge and fly, in the
   studied region. The highest diversity (88.89\%) was observed in

Abstract = {The study was realized in an area of riparian forest in process by means
   of rehabilitation. The study area is located in Rio Itapemirim, in
   Alegre city, Brazil. The occupation and use of the soil before the
   recovery were of pasture with Brachiaria sp. The recovery of this area
   was in 1997, with autochthonous and allochthonous species, in casually
   distribution arrangement, in an area of 1,2 ha. For this studies was
   realized forest inventories in the periods of 2004/2005 and 2005/2006.
   being measured the arboreal individuals with circumference at breast
   height (CBH) and total heights. The species found in the area were
   identified and classified in this ecological groups, dispersion
   syndromes and wild presence, it forms calculated the floristic
   parameters, the vertical structure and the structural dynamics of this
   plantation. The objective of this work went evaluate the development of
   the plantation implanted to subsidize practical silviculture with
   relationship to the selection and plantation of species for the
   revegetation of degraded areas of riparian forest, in similar
   conditions. The results of the studies demonstrated that a forest
   plantation was implanted with great diversity of species and the bedding
   in height classes it went to the likeness of natural heterogeneous. The
   species identified as builders of the plantation of the studied area
   were: Anadenanthera colubrina, Caesalpinia leyostachia, Acacia
   auriculiformis, Acacia mangium, Handroanthus serratifolius, Inga edulis,
   Joannesia princeps, Pterogyne nitens, Enterelobium contortisiliquum,
   Tabernaemontana hystrix, and Anthocephalus Milieus. The implanted
   community's distribution diametric happens in reverse J shape having the
   pioneer individuals' predominance in all the classes of CBH. The

Abstract = {The longhorn beetles play important roles in the forest ecosystem
   processes and their diversity is affected by many environmental
   disturbances worldwide.This study aimed at understanding how the
   structural heterogeneity of the habitat can affect the longhorn beetle
   assemblage in three areas of an Atlantic Forest, which suffered
   differential impacts in the past and are now in different successional
   stages.The area in the most advanced successional stage had mainly lower
   density of trees, but with greater availability of dead wood, especially
   larger diameter classes. They are important forest components that
   contribute to the structural diversity of the habitat providing
   resources for a variety of dependent species. This area has also shown
   the greatest richness and abundance of longhorn beetles. Our results
   suggest that these beetles are closely associated with the structural
   heterogeneity of forests and can be valuable indicators for assessing
   biodiversity and quality of forest habitat. It also shows that
   old-growth forest remnants can be the key to the maintenance of the
   diversity of the longhorn beetles and, consequently, of the ecosystem
   services they provide.},

Title = {Impacts of deforestation and forest regeneration on soil bacterial
   communities associated with phosphorus transformation processes in the
   Brazilian Amazon region},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {146},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Land-use change has negative impacts on the biodiversity of plants and
   animals. However, we lack studies and/ or information about the impacts
   of land-use change on the biodiversity of soil microorganisms,
   especially those involved in the phosphorus (P) transformation
   processes. This represents a great concern since some microbial groups
   are extremely important to different P transformation processes and
   regulate P availability in tropical and subtropical regions. In our
   study, we used shotgun DNA-metagenomic sequencing and P fractionation
   analysis to assess the effects of forest-to-pasture conversion on the
   dynamics of soil bacterial groups involved in the P transformation
   processes and their potential functions. Additionally, we assessed if
   the dynamics of these specific soil bacterial groups were recovered
   after pasture abandonment and with secondary forest establishment. Our
   results demonstrated that the land-use change altered the total amount
   of P and its fractions in the soils. The bacterial community structure
   was affected by changes in soil chemical properties, mainly by changes
   in the aluminum, total P, and labile P contents. The bacterial groups
   involved in the P transformation processes and their potential functions
   were also affected by changes in land use. The pasture soil harbored a
   distinct bacterial community when compared to the primary and secondary
   forest sites. In general, forest-to-pasture conversion increased
   bacterial groups involved in the P mineralization, including Firmicutes,
   Cyanobacteria, and Gemmatimonadetes. Conversely, we observed an increase
   of Proteobacteria members (e.g., Bradyrhizobiaceae and Beijerinckiaceae)
   and genes related to P solubilization and mineralization after pasture
   abandonment and with the secondary forest re-establishment. Our
   multi-analytical approach suggests that forest-to-pasture conversion has
   negative impacts on the biodiversity of bacterial groups involved in the
   P transformation processes and their potential functions, while the
   secondary forest re-establishment can stimulate resilience. Taken
   together, our results indicated that the bacterial groups involved in
   the P transformation and their potential functions can be gradually
   recovered and reach intermediate and/or even similar levels to those
   observed in undisturbed forest sites. This brings new insights and helps
   to improve our knowledge about the impacts of anthropogenic actions on
   the soil microbiome in the Amazon region.},

Journal = {REVISTA ARVORE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {42},
Number = {2},
Abstract = {In order to contribute to the discussion on how forest development
   interacts with hydrological processes related to rainfall partitioning,
   we aimed to characterize the rainfall interception (RI), throughfall
   (Tf), stemflow (Sf), and net precipitation (NP) in three Cerrado areas
   at different stages of natural regeneration conduction: treatment 1 =
   area with 4 years without human intervention; treatment 2 = 10 years;
   and treatment 3 = 43 years. In all areas, three 400-m(2) plots were
   established, in each of which 12 rain gauges and stemflow collectors
   were installed on all trees having Diameter at Breast High (DBH) > 5 cm.
   Data was recorded from December 2015 through November 2016. At treatment
   1, Tf corresponded to 100\% of gross precipitation (GP) in the
   micro-basin, while Sf corresponded to 0.01\%, RI to 0\%, and NP to 100\%
   of GP. At treatment 2, Tf corresponded to 96\% of GP, whereas Sf
   corresponded to 0.19\%, RI to 4\%, and NP to 96\% of GP. At treatment 3,
   Tf corresponded to 87\% of GP, while Sf corresponded to 1.15\%, RI to
   12\%, and NP to 88\%. The results revealed significant differences among
   the study areas. Both RI and Sf increased with advancing natural
   regeneration, while Tf and NP decreased. Data varied according to
   vegetation features, like the number and density of individuals and
   species in each plot, and according to characteristics related to
   weather and precipitation in the area.},

   on environmental heterogeneity (EH), species richness (SR), and
   functional richness (FRic) and the role of EH in the abundance of

   the Acara-Capim basin, eastern Amazon. We used path analysis to assess
   whether land-use types influence the predominant vegetation cover and
   channel characteristics, and their indirect effect on EH, SR, and FRic.
   Taxa indicator threshold analysis was used to assess whether fish
   species and functional groups act as bioindicators of EH and percentage
   of forest in total catchment (PFTC). The higher percentage of secondary
   forest in total catchment (PSFTC) favored herbaceous understory plants
   and SR. The largest amount of sediments and higher PSFTC negatively
   influenced EH. FRic was not influenced by any of the variables. Species
   with high swimming ability that belong to the trophic guilds piscivores
   and invertivores, are associated with high values of EH and PFTC. Our
   results may be useful for riparian forest restoration projects, as we
   show which variables increase or decrease EH and demonstrate how

Abstract = {Habitat destruction and fragmentation alter the quality of habitats and
   put populations under the risk of extinction. Changes in population
   parameters can provide early warning signs of negative impacts. In
   tropical forests, where habitat loss and fragmentation are vast, such
   indicators are of high relevance for directing conservation efforts
   before effects are irreversible. Most of our knowledge from tropical
   ecosystems originates from community level surveys, whereas our
   understanding of the influence of habitat conversion on vital rates of
   species is limited. This study focused on the influence of anthropogenic
   habitat fragmentation on the survival probability and abundance of three
   leaf-litter frog species (Rhinella errata, Ischnocnema guentheri and I.
   parva) in forest patches of the Atlantic rainforest of South-east Brazil
   compared to a continuous forest. The species differ in their matrix
   tolerance: high for R. ornata and low for I. guentheri and I. parva and,
   thus, we examined whether their survival and abundance correspond to
   this classification. behnoeneina guentheri showed highest abundances in
   all study sites and low mortality in the forest patches compared to the
   continuous forest; I. parva was encountered only in isolated fragments,
   with very low mortality in one isolated fragment; and the matrix
   tolerant species had generally low abundance and showed no clear pattern
   in terms of mortality in the different sites. Our counter-intuitive
   results show that even matrix sensitive amphibian species may show high
   abundance and low mortality in small forest patches. Therefore, these
   patches can be of high value for amphibian conservation regardless of
   their degree of matrix aversion. Landscape level conservation planning
   should not abandon small habitat patches, especially in highly
   fragmented tropical environments.},

Abstract = {Tropical forest regeneration has gained renewed interest in recent years
   as secondary forests have being considered biodiversity repositories and
   a key source for globally relevant ecosystem services as climate
   regulation and carbon sequestration and storage. Here, we address the
   regeneration of a Caatinga dry forest in the context of slash-and-burn
   agriculture and chronic anthropogenic disturbance by examining forest
   regeneration mechanisms and a comprehensive set of community-level plant
   diversity measures (i.e., taxonomic, functional, and phylogenetic) in
   regenerating (4 to 70-yr old) and old-growth forest stands. Resprouting
   from root suckers was the predominant regeneration mechanism across
   recently abandoned crop fields. Overall, regenerating forests were
   similar to old-growth forests in terms of taxonomic and functional
   composition, and functional and phylogenetic diversity. Moreover, except
   for the taxonomic diversity, community-level plant diversity measures
   were not related to forest age or soil properties. Our results suggest
   that Caatinga dry forest covering sandy soils is particularly resilient
   due to regeneration driven by resprouting. The same set of plant species
   dominates the entire regeneration process, including old-growth forest
   stands. Accordingly, Caatinga dry forest regeneration may follow an
   initial composition model, rather than following a directional and
   deterministic trajectory associated with species replacements. This
   initial composition model probably results from a combination of three
   factors: (1) early regeneration driven by resprouting rather than seed
   arrival and seedling recruitment; (2) biomass accumulation mostly due to
   growth by early colonizers and by those species able to resprout after
   chronic anthropogenic disturbance and during forest regeneration; and
   (3) the co-occurrence of functionally distinct plant species.
   Accordingly, resprouting can guarantee some level of resilience, and
   hence, the services provided by secondary forests. Nevertheless, forest
   dynamics in landscapes inhabited by forest-dependent people are affected
   to a great extent by the nature of the imposed pressures and the
   ecological profile of the remaining flora.},

Abstract = {Successional agroforestry systems have the capacity to increase soil
   fertility and restore degraded ecosystems. The objective of this study
   was to investigate the influence of agroforestry systems, at different
   stages of ecological succession, on the dynamics of chemical and
   physical soil fertility attributes in the Brazil South region. Soil
   samples were collected under five different conditions: (i) Control (T)
   = initial system (without agroforestry); (ii) SAF1 = agroforestry with 1
   year of development; (iii) SAF3 = agroforestry with 3 years of
   development; (iv) SAF7 = agroforestry with 7 years of development; and
   (v) reference system (naturally regenerating forest with 30 years).
   Subsequently, determinations/calculations were carried out for chemical
   attributes/parameters (exchangeable Ca2+, Mg2+, K+, Na+, P, Al3+, H+,
   sum of bases, effective and potential cation exchange capacity, cation
   exchange saturation with bases and Al3+), physical attributes (soil bulk
   density, particle density, total porosity, and moisture), and soil
   physicochemical properties (pH H2O, pH in saline solutions, and SMP
   method), as well as chemical element stocks were calculated based on
   soil mass in each sampled layer. Results showed an increase in pH, total
   porosity, and nutrient stocks with the systems' development time,
   accompanied by a decrease in acidity components. The increase in soil
   fertility is directly related to the increase in soil organic matter

Title = {Bringing the forest back: Restoration priorities in Colombia},
Journal = {DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS},
Year = {2024},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {AimColombia has committed to ambitious forest restoration targets which
   include a 1 million ha Bonn Challenge commitment and 6.47-8.31 million
   ha (rehabilitation and restoration, respectively) under the National
   Restoration Plan. Determining where and how to implement programs to
   achieve these targets remains a significant
   challenge.LocationColombia.MethodsWe adopt a multi-objective
   optimisation framework for restoration planning and apply it to
   Colombia. We explore cost-effective solutions that leverage the
   potential for assisted natural regeneration benefits while accounting
   for opportunity and establishment costs of restoration and maximising
   biodiversity conservation and climate change mitigation benefits. We
   explore four politically relevant restoration area-based targets (1, 6,
   6.47 and 8.31 million ha) and identify minimum cost, and suites of
   maximum benefit and cost-effective solutions.ResultsWe identify
   solutions that simultaneously perform well across biodiversity and
   carbon objectives, despite trade-offs between these objectives. We find
   that cost-effective solutions can achieve on average 91.1\%, 90.8\%,
   90.5\% and 90.1\% of maximum carbon benefit and 100\% of the maximum
   biodiversity benefit while significantly reducing costs. On average, the
   cost-effective solutions reduce the cost by 87.5\%, 56.8\%, 59.6\% and
   46.2\% compared to the maximum benefit solutions considering one, six,
   6.47 and 8.31 million ha restoration targets, respectively.Main
   ConclusionsColombia has committed to bold restoration and conservation
   targets, such as those under the new 2030 Convention on Biological
   Diversity Global Biodiversity Framework. Strategic forest restoration
   planning will play an important role in achieving Colombia's
   biodiversity conservation and climate mitigation goals. We provide
   quantitative evidence to inform planning for environmentally and
   economically sensible restoration policy and practice in the country.
   Our framework and results can help guide Colombia towards meeting its
   ambitious forest restoration targets cost-effectively.},

Title = {The effect of ecological restoration methods on carbon stocks in the
   Brazilian Atlantic Forest},
Journal = {FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {481},
Month = {FEB 1},
Abstract = {Restoring degraded areas is an effective strategy to reestablish the
   environmental services provided by the forests including global warming
   mitigation by carbon sequestration. Restoring lands is especially
   important in the Atlantic Forest, a global hotspot in Brazil threatened
   by deforestation. To successfully restore degraded lands, it is
   necessary to apply the most suitable method for each situation. However,
   studies comparing restoration techniques are scarce. This lack of
   information hampers the Atlantic Forest restoration and, given the
   original complexity of its ecological dynamics, restoration success is
   even more challenging in this ecosystem. This study aimed to assess
   carbon stocks (above and belowgmund), carbon content (\%), and carbon
   isotope at 5-year old sites implemented by different restoration methods
   in southeastern Brazil. The restoration methods tested were active
   restoration (AR), assisted restoration (AsR), and passive restoration in
   an abandoned pasture (AP), which were compared to a nearby pasture (P)
   and a remaining forest fragment (RF). The assessed pools were: tree,
   coarse roots, fine roots, herbaceous, litter, standing dead wood, fallen
   dead wood, and soil (0-1 cm, 5-10 cm, 10-20 cm layers). Total carbon
   stock was higher on RF (152.304 Mg C ha(-1)), followed by the P (84.378
   Mg C ha(-1)), AR (66.414 Mg C h(-1)) AsR (65.73 Mg C ha(-1)) and AP
   (65.581 Mg C ha(-1)). The restoration areas sites are still too young to
   show significant differences in total carbon stock as a result of
   different restoration methods. However, carbon stock and carbon content
   (\%) differed among the pools according to the method and, in all cases,
   the largest carbon pool was soil, which shows the importance of sampling
   every pool for carbon stock and carbon content (\%) estimation. Isotope
   analysis showed that carbon inputs in the soil had different sources, C3
   or C4 plants, depending on the method. We concluded that these young
   secondary areas are already sequestering carbon, which helps mitigate
   global warming, and that monitoring every pool is important for a
   complete assessment, not only to restore secondary forests and
   understand growth but also for other land-uses such as pastures.
   Besides, the results obtained can be generalized to other tropical
   forest ecosystems with similar conditions (local and landscape),
   constituting a relevant contribution to forest restoration and
   carbon-sequestration related sciences.},

Title = {Global carbon dioxide removal rates from forest landscape restoration
   activities},
Journal = {CARBON BALANCE AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {13},
Month = {NOV 20},
Abstract = {Background: Forest landscape restoration (FLR) has been adopted by
   governments and practitioners across the globe to mitigate and adapt to
   climate change and restore ecological functions across degraded
   landscapes. However, the extent to which these activities capture CO2
   with associated climate mitigation impacts are poorly known, especially
   in geographies where data on biomass growth of restored forests are
   limited or do not exist. To fill this gap, we developed biomass
   accumulation rates for a set of FLR activities (natural regeneration,
   planted forests and woodlots, agroforestry, and mangrove restoration)
   across the globe and global CO2 removal rates with corresponding
   confidence intervals, grouped by FLR activity and region/climate.
   Results: Planted forests and woodlots were found to have the highest CO2
   removal rates, ranging from 4.5 to 40.7 t CO2 h(-1) year(-1) during the
   first 20 years of growth. Mangrove tree restoration was the second most
   efficient FLR at removing CO2, with growth rates up to 23.1 t CO2 ha(-1)
   year(-1) the first 20 years post restoration. Natural regeneration
   removal rates were 9.1-18.8 t CO2 ha(-1) year(-1) during the first 20
   years of forest regeneration, followed by agroforestry, the FLR category
   with the lowest and regionally broad removal rates (10.8-15.6 t CO2
   ha(-1) year(-1)). Biomass growth data was most abundant and widely
   distributed across the world for planted forests and natural
   regeneration, representing 45\% and 32\% of all the data points
   assessed, respectively. Agroforestry studies, were only found in Africa,
   Asia, and the Latin America and Caribbean regions.
   Conclusion: This study represents the most comprehensive review of
   published literature on tree growth and CO2 removals to date, which we
   operationalized by constructing removal rates for specific FLR
   activities across the globe. These rates can easily be applied by
   practitioners and decision-makers seeking to better understand the
   positive climate mitigation impacts of existing or planned FLR actions,
   or by countries making restoration pledges under the Bonn Challenge
   Commitments or fulfil ling Nationally Determined Contributions to the
   UNFCCC, thereby helping boost FLR efforts world-wide.},

Abstract = {In this study, we sought to carry out the floristic and structural
   characterization of three forest fragments that underwent anthropic
   intervention, at different time intervals, located in the Environmental
   Protection Area `Lago do Amapa' in Rio Branco, state of Acre, Brazil.
   Fragment I has a history of intervention for the formation of pasture
   and timber extraction in the 1960s. Fragment II has a history of
   intervention for cutting/burning and planting in the 1970s and Fragment
   III has a history of intervention for the formation of pastures in the
   1980s. For floristic and phytosociological sampling, two plots per
   fragment measuring 0.5 hectares each (20 m x 250 m) were allocated,
   totaling an area of three ha. All arboreal individuals with DBH = 10 cm
   were inventoried. Phytosociological parameters such as dominance,
   density, frequency, Importance Value (IV) and basal area were
   calculated. The diversity between fragments was obtained using the
   Shannon-Weaver index (H') and similarity using the Jaccard index. The
   comparisons of means were performed using the Tukey test with 5\%
   significance. Altogether, 1,427 individuals were inventoried,
   distributed in 44 families and 193 species. The H' diversity indices
   found were: 4.21 for Fragment I, 3.74 for Fragment II and 3.50 for
   Fragment III. The Jaccard index showed a greater similarity between
   fragments II and III. Fragment I differed statistically from the others
   in relation to the basal area, number of genera and species. The medium
   strata (height class 8 = h <16.93) had the largest number of
   individuals. Regarding the diametric classes, a greater number of
   first-class individuals was observed, following the inverted J pattern
   in all fragments. The result of the study pointed out that the fragment
   with the oldest history of anthropization has structure, richness and
   diversity of species distinct from the other fragments.},

Title = {Mapping the regeneration potential of native vegetation in cultivated

Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {195},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The Brazilian Cerrado is a hotspot of biodiversity conservation and an
   important global agricultural region. Cultivated pastures under
   different degradation levels are dominant in the landscape and are being
   targeted for sustainable agricultural intensification and restoration of
   native vegetation. In this study, we classified the cultivated pastures
   of the Brazilian Cerrado according to their potential for natural
   regeneration, based on field surveys and environmental predictors. We
   surveyed the native vegetation cover in 186 plots distributed along 93
   cultivated pastures. The environmental predictors considered in this
   study were the proportion of sand in the soil, cation exchange capacity,
   climate water deficit, pasture age, slope, and pasture vigor index. We
   then applied the Random Forest regression algorithm to predict and map
   the cultivated pastures according to their potential for natural
   regeneration in the 19 Cerrado ecoregions. The potential for natural
   regeneration was classified into low (< 30\% of native plant cover),
   medium (30-50\%), and high (> 50\%). Our prediction explained 75\% of
   the data variability. Most of the cultivated pastures presented medium
   potential for natural regeneration (57\%), while 31\% and 12\% presented
   high and low potentials, respectively. Cultivated pastures in ecoregions
   with high mechanization, due to their high water availability and
   extensive flat terrains, presented low potential for natural
   regeneration. This first attempt to map the potential for natural
   regeneration in the cultivated pastures of the Brazilian Cerrado can be
   used as a proxy for planning low-cost and predictable restoration or
   environmentally sustainable intensification in this major type of land
   use found in this biome.},

Journal = {ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2022},

Abstract = {The advance of land-use change processes in the Amazon rainforest has
   modified its natural landscape, resulting in losses of biodiversity and
   ecological functions. Under this scenario, some reforestation methods
   have been proposed and tested in degraded areas aiming to reverse
   environmental damage. We assess the efficiency of three reforestation
   methods by investigating the taxonomic and functional diversity of birds
   in a post-mining landscape located in the eastern Brazilian Amazon. We
   counted birds in 56 sites located in both forest and areas under the
   process of ecological restoration through natural regeneration, planting
   seedlings, and nucleation. Species composition and richness differed
   significantly between forests and areas under recovery. Nucleation
   showed distinct species composition from planting seedlings or natural
   regeneration areas, which can be explained by the difference in
   environmental structure in the areas recovering by this method. Although
   age did not influence species richness, we observed different species
   composition between old and young areas that received planting of
   seedlings. In general, we found no differences in functional diversity
   and functional richness between the methods of recovery. We conclude
   that the three recovery strategies evaluated herein showed a similar
   efficiency. However, it is necessary to consider that perhaps eight
   years is a short period to observe significant differences in the
   structure of the areas recovered by the different methods and,
   consequently, the structure of bird communities. Also, the diversity
   patterns of the current bird communities located in the post-mining
   areas were far from those found in forest areas, indicating the need for
   maintaining long-term recovery programs.},

Abstract = {Shifting cultivation is a traditional land-use system to ensure
   livelihood in the Northern Amazon. Here, we evaluated how
   intensification of shifting cultivation (SC) affects secondary forest
   recovery in the northern Amazon forest. To measure intensity of shifting
   cultivation, we used the number of previous SC cycles. We selected three
   study sites containing second-growth forest (SG) with different stand
   ages (5 and 10 years) after one, three or six SC cycles. Furthermore, we
   selected old-growth forest (OG) in each study site. In each selected SG
   and OG, three plots of 20 x 50 m were established, totalizing 63 plots
   in the study area. In each plot, all trees, palms and lianas with
   diameter at breast height >= 5 cm were tagged and identified to species
   level. We analyzed the effects of SC intensification and soil fertility
   on woody species richness, species composition and basal area using
   mixed effect models. Species richness and basal area, lower in SG than
   in OG, increased with regeneration time after abandonment, but reduced
   with intensification of SC. Community dissimilarities (Bray-Curtis
   distances) between OG and SG increased with the number of shifting
   cultivation cycles. Soil fertility differed between SG with different
   regeneration stages and reduced with number of SC cycles. We found that
   soil fertility and management intensity, i.e., number of previous SC
   cycles, explained pattern observed in richness, species composition and
   basal area equally good. Due to nutrient exports with crops and
   increasing nutrient leaching, soil fertility is expected to reduce with
   SC intensity. Therefore, our data indicate that intensification of SC
   reduces recovery of species richness, composition and basal area of SGs
   following productive periods. Thus, the intensification of SC reduces
   the resilience of SGs, turning this ancient form of land-use
   unsustainable. Environmental sustainability of SC may be achieved by
   extending fallow periods, limiting the maximum yield. To attend growing
   demands of indigenous and non-indigenous communities, we propose other
   alternatives of land-use such as permanent agroforestry systems.},

Abstract = {Forest regeneration is becoming a powerful tool to combat land
   conversion which covers 30 \% of the Neotropical territory. However,
   little is known about the effect of forest regeneration on vector-borne
   diseases. Here, we describe the haemosporidian lineage composition
   across a successional gradient within an Atlantic Forest bird community.
   We test whether forest successional stages, in addition to host life
   history traits affect haemosporidian infection probability. We sampled
   birds at 16 sampling units with different successional stages between
   2017 and 2018 within a forest remnant located in Antonina, Paran<acute
   accent>a, Brazil. We captured bird individuals using mist-nets,
   identified them to the species level, and collected blood samples to
   detect and identify Plasmodium and Haemoproteus lineages based on
   molecular analysis. We used a Bayesian phylogenetic linear model with a
   Bernoulli distribution to test whether the haemosporidian infection
   probability is affected by nest type, foraging stratum, and forest
   successional stage. We captured 322 bird individuals belonging to 52
   species and 21 families. We found 31 parasite lineages and an overall
   haemosporidian prevalence of 23.9 \%, with most infections being caused
   by Plasmodium (21.7 \% of prevalence). The Plasmodium probability of
   infection was associated with forest successional stage and bird
   foraging stratum. Birds from the secondary forest in an intermediate
   stage of succession are more likely to be infected by the parasites than
   birds from the primary forests (8 = 1.21, 95 \% CI = 0.11 - 2.43), birds
   from upper strata exhibit a lower probability of infection than birds
   from lower foraging strata (8 = -1.81, 95 \% CI = -3.80 - -0.08). Nest
   type did not affect the Plasmodium probability of infection. Our results
   highlight the relevance of forest succession on haemosporidian infection
   dynamics, which is particularly relevant in a world where natural
   regeneration is the main tool used in forest restoration.},

   (Fabaceae) Regeneration in Eastern Amazon},
Journal = {FORESTS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {8},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Timber management directly influences the population dynamics of tree
   species, like Copaifera spp. (copaiba), which provide oil-resin with
   ecological and economic importance. The aim of this study was to
   evaluate the structure and population dynamics of Copaifera in unmanaged
   and managed stands by reduced-impact logging (RIL) in eastern Amazon in
   Para state, Brazil. Based on a stem map of the study area, 40 Copaifera
   trees were randomly selected, where an equal number of trees were
   selected in managed and unmanaged stands. A transect of 10 x 100 m was
   centered at each tree (50 m each side) to assess Copaifera regeneration.
   Transects were subdivided into ten plots, of which six were
   systematically chosen to assess the height, diameter and number of
   Copaifera seedlings and saplings. The field assessment occurred in 2011
   and 2013. To estimate the amount of sunlight transmitted to the forest
   floor, we computed canopy cover from airborne LiDAR data. According to
   the results, the abundance of Copaifera seedlings/saplings was higher in
   managed than unmanaged stands. About 5\% of Copaifera regeneration was
   found between 45-50 m from the Copaifera tree while -73\% of
   regeneration was concentrated within a 10 m radius of the Copaifera
   tree. We verified that the diameter distribution of Copaifera
   regeneration was not a negative exponential distribution, as is typical
   of most tree species in natural forest. Rather, the Copaifera
   regeneration had a spatially aggregated distribution. In this short-term
   analysis, the impact of timber management is not negatively affecting
   the population structure or dynamics of Copaifera regeneration.},

Abstract = {The mechanisms affecting forest regeneration in human-modified
   landscapes are attracting increasing attention as tropical forests have
   been recognized as key habitats for biodiversity conservation, provision
   of ecosystem services, and human well-being. Here we investigate the
   effect of the leaf-cutting ants (LCA) Atta opaciceps on regenerating
   plant assemblages in Caatinga dry forest. Our study encompassed 15 Atta
   opaciceps colonies located in landscape patches with a gradient of
   forest cover from 8.7\% to 87.8\%, where we monitored regenerating
   individuals (seedlings and saplings of woody and herbaceous plants) in
   different habitats (nests, foraging areas, and control areas) over one
   year. We recorded 2,977 regenerating plant individuals, distributed
   among 55 species from 23 families. Herbaceous plants represented 82.1\%
   and 58.2\% of the total number of individuals and species, respectively.
   Species richness of both the whole and herbaceous plant assemblages
   increased along the forest cover gradient, but without difference
   between the habitats. Total plant abundance was highest in control areas
   followed by foraging areas and nests and this pattern held for both
   woody and herbaceous plants. Although forest cover did not influence the
   abundance of herbaceous plants and the whole plant assemblage, it
   positively affects woody plant abundance across control areas. Forest
   cover and habitat changed species composition of both the entire
   regenerating and the herbaceous assemblages. These results together
   indicate that LCA negatively impact regenerating plant assemblages,
   particularly in those sites with increased forest cover. As LCA
   proliferate in human-modified landscapes, they may prevent plant
   regeneration of disturbed areas.},

Abstract = {1. Forests account for a substantial part of the terrestrial biomass
   storage and productivity. To better understand forest productivity, we
   need to disentangle the processes underlying net biomass change.
   2. We tested how above-ground net biomass change and its underlying
   biomass dynamics (biomass recruitment, growth and mortality) can be
   explained by four alternative and contested hypotheses; the soil
   fertility, biomass ratio, niche complementarity and vegetation quantity
   hypotheses.
   3. Above-ground biomass dynamics were evaluated over a 5-year period in
   200 permanent sample plots in 8 tropical dry forests in Brazil, and
   related to soil fertility, community-weighted mean (CWM) traits that are
   important for carbon storage and sequestration (wood density, specific
   leaf area, maximum stem diameter and deciduousness), species richness,
   functional diversity and initial stand biomass.
   4. Initial stand biomass was the best predictor of all three processes
   of biomass dynamics, providing strong support for the vegetation
   quantity hypothesis. In these dry forests, the dominance of conservative
   species, rather than of acquisitive species, is associated with high
   biomass growth and storage, probably because their low specific leaf
   area and high wood density allow them to keep on functioning during
   drought stress.
   5. Paradoxically, high soil fertility (Ca) led to low biomass
   productivity, probably because of nutrient imbalance.
   6. In contrast to what is shown for controlled experiments, we found no
   support for niche complementarity (in terms of functional diversity or
   species richness) for forest productivity. Biomass storage was favoured
   by low-rather than high trait diversity, as most of the biomass is
   concentrated in species with large stem diameter and high wood density.
   7. Synthesis. Biomass dynamics are mainly shaped by vegetation quantity,
   and then by vegetation quality, in line with the mass ratio hypothesis.
   Dry forests show different trait-productivity relationships than wet
   forests, as stands with `slow' trait values are `fast' in terms of
   productivity. Diversity matters, but in a different way than expected;
   high trait diversity does not enhance productivity, but instead, does
   low trait diversity enhance carbon storage.},

Abstract = {Environmental filters select species with different characteristics.
   However, these do not exhibit the functional integration of the whole
   plant level.
   Functional integration at the whole plant level, between the strategies
   of the various plant organs, needs to be better elucidated to facilitate
   the understanding of species ecology over an environmental gradient.
   Thus, hypotheses were proposed that (1) if functional integration exists
   between organs, the leaf economic spectrum will be a good indicator of
   the plant economic spectrum, and that (2) processes of community
   assembly will change over a successional gradient, generating different
   economic spectra for the plant. To test these predictions, data on eight
   functional characteristics (leaf, reproductive, stem and whole plant)
   was collected in 65 species, distributed in six secondary growth forests
   (three with approximately 17 years and three with approximately 25 years
   of abandonment) and three mature forests, located within the dense
   ombrophilous forest domain in the northern coastal region of Pernambuco,
   Brazil. The results showed no influence of geographic distance
   (autocorrelation) or phylogeny. Positive correlations were observed
   between leaf nutrient concentration (N and P), and negative correlations
   were observed between leaf nutrient concentration and dry matter
   content. Functional integration at the whole plant level was not
   observed. On the primary axis of the principal components analysis, only
   leaf characteristics and wood density were coordinates, following the
   same strategy, whilst on the secondary axis, only leaf characteristics
   and maximum height were coordinates. The observed change in species
   composition and abundance over the gradient was sufficient for changes
   in the distribution of functional characteristics and, therefore in
   strategies, to be observed.},

Abstract = {The expression of chemical compounds by individual plants of the same
   species in different locations may be affected by abiotic factors
   resulting in differences in the production of allelopathic compounds.
   The objective of this study was to compare the phytochemical profiles of
   plant species from two different forest formations in the state of
   Parana, Brazil. The forest formations were Seasonal Semideciduous Forest
   (SSF) and Lowland Ombrophilous Dense Forest (LODF), and the five study
   species were Jacaranda micrantha, Cecropia pachystachya, Mimosa
   bimucronata, Schinus terebinthifolius and Cedrela fissilis. Secondary
   metabolites were extracted by exhaustive extraction with methanol, and
   the crude extract was fractionated using column chromatography. The
   fractions were used to calculate the retention factor of the main
   compounds using thin layer chromatography and phytochemical tests. The
   classes of compounds identified were practically the same among the
   analyzed species, however, at different levels of concentration. The
   type of tannins found in S. terebinthifolius differed between the two
   forest formations.},

Abstract = {Turvo Park in the Alto Uruguay River region of the State of Rio Grande
   do Sul is the last intact remnant of the Seasonally Deciduous Forest in
   southern Brazil. This forest once covered large parts of southern Brazil
   but it is now reduced to less than 3\% of its original size due to
   intensive logging caused by its exceptional richness in tree species
   with commercial timber value. The current study presents results on the
   diversity of timber species inventored in Turvo Park and in a number of
   small and scattered forest remnants in its vicinity. All timber plants
   with DBH >= 5 cm were included in the forest inventory on 540 sampling
   points, established using the point-centred quarter method. On average,
   313 plants ha(-1) were recorded, belonging to 57 different species from
   25 families. Timber species of commercial value represented 64\% of all
   woody species and 36\% of all woody plants. Nectandra megapotamica and
   Apuleia leiocarpa were the main dominant species. Twenty percent of all
   plants showed a DBH greater than 40 cm, representing 67\% of the total
   log volume. Differences in species diversity and plant density among the
   forest remnants were detected. The few forest remnants represent an
   enormous richness of timber species, being the maintainers and propagule
   repository for all the biodiversity of that ecosystem. A knowledge-based
   forest management plan is therefore required to secure their vital role
   in forest enrichment programs or in projects aiming at recovering
   abandoned and degraded areas, and in breeding programs for the timber
   production improvement, (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The response of plant species to the variation in abiotic factors
   affects the regeneration capacity and, consequently, the structure of
   the forest community. This study aims to describe the structure of the
   regenerating stratum in a Brazilian montane rainforest and investigate
   its relationship with environmental and spatial variables along an
   altitudinal gradient. Data on the height and diameter at soil height of
   regenerating individuals and environmental variables were collected from
   28 sample units, distributed in seven altitudinal sites. To understand
   the spatial influence on species distribution, spatial variables (MEMs -
   Moran's Eigenvector Maps) were created based on geographic coordinates.
   Phytosociological parameters were calculated by species. Floristic
   similarity between the altitudinal quota was determined by the Bray
   -Curtis index (UPGMA), and the species that characterize each group were
   determined by the Indicator Species Analysis. Redundancy Analysis (RDA)
   was performed, and generalized linear models were adjusted to verify the
   influence of environmental and spatial factors on regenerating
   vegetation. The species Palicourea sessilis had the highest Importance
   Value in the regenerating community. Two floristic groups were formed:
   the highest sites (1420 to 1550 m a.s.l.) were floristically more
   similar to each other (Group 1) than to the sites in the 1112 to 1391 m
   elevation range (Group 2). Overall, 11 species were indicators of Group
   1 and only one of Group 2. Finally, a pattern of species substitution
   was verified as a function of abiotic factors. The first two axes of the
   RDA explained 51.02\% of the variation in the floristic composition of
   the regenerating community. Natural regeneration demonstrated
   environmental preferences, being influenced by luminosity, abundance in
   adult components, calcium and sodium contents, plant litter
   accumulation, altitude, and the spatial structure of the environment.
   Altitude did not seem to influence the pattern of abundance or richness
   of regenerating species.},

Abstract = {Fire in tropical forests jeopardizes natural regeneration and can lead
   to the establishment of an alternative stable state. To address the
   effects of fire on natural regeneration in a lowland tropical forest, we
   performed a time series study over 12 years, focusing on the impact of
   fire frequency and post-fire regeneration time on vegetation structure,
   diversity, and functional composition in secondary forests. The study
   was conducted in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest at sites subjected to
   different fire frequencies (never, once, three, and four times over 44
   years) and old-growth forests. During 12 years of monitoring time, no
   significant difference was observed in community structure and diversity
   among sites subjected to fire, which suggests an arrested succession
   pattern and corroborates with the establishment of an alternative stable
   state. Functional traits associated with fire resistance, including wood
   density and bark thickness, were higher in areas with fire history
   compared to old-growth forests. Therefore, our results showed that
   recurrent fires can lead communities toward an arrested succession
   pattern with a high divergence in community structure and functional
   composition compared to old-growth forest. These results have several
   practical implications for restoration and conservation programs in the
   Brazilian Atlantic Forest.},

Abstract = {Human-induced wildfires are increasing in frequency in tropical forests,
   and their deleterious consequences for biodiversity include decreases in
   seed rain, which may be affected directly by fire or indirectly by the
   creation of edges between forest and non-forest environments.
   Understanding seed rain is key to assess the potential for natural
   regeneration in plant communities. We assessed the impact of fire and
   fire-created edges on seed rain species richness, abundance, size,
   weight, and dispersal syndromes in Atlantic Forest remnants in Bahia,
   Brazil. We assessed seed rain at monthly intervals for an entire year
   along seven 300 m-long transects placed perpendicular to the edge. We
   installed seed traps at the edge and at 20, 40, 60, 80, 100, and 150 m
   into the burnt area and into the forest from forest edge. We recorded a
   total of 9050 seeds belonging to 250 morphospecies. We did not observe
   edge influence; however, we detected a lower abundance and proportion of
   animal-dispersed seeds in the burnt than in the unburnt areas. The seed
   abundance in the burnt areas was lower and seeds were smaller and
   lighter than those in the unburnt area. Seed rain in the burnt area was
   not greater near to the forest than far from it. The abundance and
   richness of seed rain was positively correlated with tree density. Our
   findings highlight the lack of seed rain in burnt areas and differences
   in community composition between the burnt and unburnt areas.
   Collectively, these results indicate negative consequences on natural
   regeneration, which can lead to permanent secondarization of the
   vegetation and challenges for early regeneration of burnt areas, which
   will initially have impoverished forests due to low seed richness.},

Abstract = {Development activities in Altamira, Para, Brazil began with the
   construction of the Transamazon Highway in 1970. In the early years land
   use emphasized annual crops, followed by pasture development. During the
   second decade of settlement, land cover in the region shifted from
   `degraded pastures' or early stages of secondary successional vegetation
   to increased dominance of intermediate and late secondary succession.
   This finding is a result of recent research using Landsat TM satellite
   data and detailed field studies of vegetation stand structure. Close to
   40\% of the forest had been removed by 1985, but between 1985 and 1991
   there is clear evidence for twice as much regrowth as there is new
   deforestation. Land use has a significant effect on the vegetation's
   total height, stem height, and basal area. The use of satellite data in
   combination witt! detailed studies of vegetation stand structure and
   land use histories gathered from households provide a multilevel
   approach that allows integration of local, regional, and global patterns
   of secondary succession in agricultural areas, and informs restoration
   strategies for Amazonia.},

Journal = {REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIA DO SOLO},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {44},
Abstract = {Histosols provide several ecosystem services, related mainly to their
   reserves of carbon and nitrogen. Management practices in these soils can
   increase the mineralization of organic matter and contribute to the
   emission of greenhouse gases. This study aimed to investigate the effect
   of tillage with plowing and drainage on Histosol properties in three
   land use systems located in the municipality of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
   Three areas subjected to different land use systems over the last twenty
   years were chosen: Area 1, secondary forest with natural regeneration;
   Area 2, conventional tillage of cassava with plowing; and Area 3,
   intercropped coconut + cassava with an artificial drainage system. The
   chemical characterization, von Post scale of organic matter
   decomposition, percentage of rubbed fiber, organic matter, percentage of
   mineral material, bulk density, electrical conductivity, soluble
   phosphate, total organic carbon (TOC) and nitrogen (NT), organic carbon
   fractions, and C and N stocks were analyzed. Our results showed the
   critical, nearly irreversible effects of agricultural practices
   comprising drainage and plowing of the soil. Over twenty years, in Area
   2, the TOC and NT values decreased by 33 and 20 \%, respectively in the
   histic horizon, and by about 17 and 8 \%, respectively in the gley
   horizon. In Area 3, the TOC and NT values decreased by 31 and 18 \%,
   respectively, in the histic horizon, and by 27 and 21 \% in the gley
   horizon. Our findings also showed that the loss of C is related to the
   labile organic carbon, which is more sensitive to environmental changes,
   even at deeper depths. The plowing of the soil decreases the organic
   matter content due to the accelerated oxidation of organic matter,
   increasing the bulk density. Drainage, besides the loss of organic
   matter by subsidence, promotes the sulfidization of the soil with a high
   content of SO42-, due to the oxidation of soil materials containing
   sulfides.},

Abstract = {The Atlantic forests of southern Bahia in Brazil present great species
   richness and a high degree of endemism. A large part of these native
   forests were transformed into cacao plantations in an agroforestry
   system known locally as cabrucas, where native trees were culled and
   cacao was planted under the shade of remaining trees. The present study
   analyzed the influence of time of implantation ( age) and time of
   abandonment of management practices on tree species diversity of cabruca
   plantations to evaluate the capacity for conservation and recovery of
   species richness of native Atlantic Forest trees in cabrucas.
   Phytosociological surveys were conducted in five cabrucas with different
   conditions of age and state of abandonment. All trees, including
   hemiepiphytes and excluding the cacao plants, with a minimum stem
   diameter of 10 cm at breast height, were surveyed within a 3- ha
   sampling area in each plantation. A total of 2514 individual trees
   belonging to 293 species and 52 families were recorded in the five
   cabrucas. The Shannon diversity index varied from 3.31 to 4.22 among the
   cabrucas and was positively correlated with the time of abandonment ( r
   = 0.97). The new cabrucas showed the highest values of estimated total
   richness ( Chao) and the highest proportion of late successional species
   than the old ones. All areas preserved a very high proportion of native
   forest species while the three old cabrucas showed a higher proportion
   of exotic species than the two new ones. Thus the exotic species seem to
   replace more of the native species in the long run because of management
   practices and local preferences. The cabrucas presented also a high
   capacity for the regeneration of tree species richness after
   abandonment. Simple alterations in management practices could improve
   the recruitment of late successional species in these areas. Economic
   incentives may be necessary for the farmers to adopt management
   practices to retain native species which bring no economic returns.},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The deforestation has led to local loss of species and important
   ecosystem services performed by them, causing ecological and economic
   losses. It is proposed that the reforestation of such areas aims to
   reduce those impacts. However, particularly in the tropics, little is
   known about the real success of different types of reforestation in the
   recovery of the species, and especially of the population parameters.
   Here we evaluated whether different types of reforestations affect
   Trypoxylon (Trypargilum) lactitarse Saussure (Hymenoptera: Crabronidae)
   in terms of abundance, percentage of emergence, proportion of males,
   fluctuating asymmetry, and foraging capacity. We compared primary forest
   (control) data to data collected in five different habitats: pasture,
   secondary forest, and tree plantations of Teak, Ficus, and a mixture of
   native species. The abundance of T. lactitarse was higher in tree
   plantations than in pasture. However, among the analyzed parameters,
   Teak plantation presented lower emergence percentage and the majority of
   individuals born were males. The emerged females in this habitat showed
   higher asymmetry and lower foraging capacity. Ficus showed lower
   individual abundance and mixed plantation showed lower emergence
   percentage, with both plantation types showing higher male emergence. On
   the other hand, in secondary forest, the analyzed parameters did not
   differ in relation to the primary forest, being the habitat more
   efficient in relation to those with tree planting. The changes in
   population parameters of T. lactitarse in different reforestations and
   particularly on Teak monocultures were probably attributed to indirect
   effects, such as low food availability and inadequate environmental
   conditions.},

Abstract = {Ecological Models of Species abundance distribution (SADs) of a tree
   community were investigated to find: (i) if environmental variables are

   if the tree community has many species with intermediate levels of
   abundance and a few rare and common species; (iv) and if, in secondary
   succession, the later colonizing species have greatest needs for a
   specialized niche, so, they are more rare than the initial colonizers
   species. The data were obtained in eight sampling units with dimensions
   of 20m x 50m, distributed in a systematic way, totaling 0.8 ha sample;
   grouped in five models of SADs (broken-stick, niche-preemption,
   lognormal, Zipf and Zipf-Mandelbrot) for the sample of the tree
   community and the eight sampling units; the criteria of accuracy of the
   models were: Akaike, Bayesian and Deviance. The ecological model
   described the SADs that rank/abundance of tree species for ecological
   community which was the Zipf-Mandelbrot. The ecological models of SADs
   that characterized the eight sampling units were niche-preemption, Zipf
   and Zipf-Mandelbrot. The Zipf-Mandelbrot model postulates the
   colonization of species under the requirements of environmental
   preconditions for the establishment of the species, and thus detects up
   an arboreal community stage of maturity. The ecological models of SADs
   obtained for the sampling units, separately, show the disparity in the

   interpreted as the effect of heterogeneity of conditions and
   environmental resources, and natural disturbances, originating a mosaic

   during recovery after pasture abandonment at two seasons. Soil ammonium
   was higher in the dry season and nitrate higher in the wet season and
   increased these with pasture abandonment age. V. japurensis, B.

Journal = {DENDROCHRONOLOGIA},

Abstract = {Fire-resistant species may have an essential ecological role in the
   natural regeneration process of degraded landscapes. Moquiniastrum
   polymorphum is a ruderal and fire-resistant species that occupies
   fire-disturbed areas in Brazilian Atlantic Forest. Evaluating a species'
   growth sensitivity to fire and climate can help understand its complex
   successional process. In the present study, we used dendrochronology to
   describe the radial growth trajectories of M. polymorphum in a
   fire-disturbed area in the Atlantic Forest (Poco das Anta Biological
   Reserve), detect post-fire effects on the species' growth, and
   investigate climate-growth relationships. We described the long-term
   growth trend of the species, it increased in the first years and was
   constant in the following years. The chronology was positively
   correlated with precipitation and negatively correlated with temperature
   at the end of the rainy season. Our results reveal that M. polymorphum
   did not reduce its growth after fire events. When observing through an
   epoch perspective, fire can even be positive to the species growth.
   These growth results indicated species fire resistance, which likely
   provides a resilient tree cover after forest fires and allows disturbed
   Atlantic Forest environments to break grass-fire cycles. This resistance
   may have a direct relationship with the opportunistic characteristic of
   the species in fire-prone areas in the Atlantic Forest. However, we
   highlight the critical role this species plays in the natural
   regeneration of burned sites in the Atlantic Forest.},

Abstract = {Secondary forests are an increasingly common feature in tropical
   landscapes worldwide and understanding their regeneration is necessary
   to design effective restoration strategies. It has previously been shown
   that the woody species community in secondary forests can follow
   different successional pathways according to the nature of past human
   activities in the area, yet little is known about patterns of herbaceous
   species diversity in secondary forests with different histories of land
   use. We compared the diversity and abundance of herbaceous plant
   communities in two types of Central Amazonian secondary forests-those
   regenerating on pastures created by felling and burning trees and those
   where trees were felled only. We also tested if plant density and
   species richness in secondary forests are related to proximity to
   primary forest. In comparison with primary forest sites, forests
   regenerating on non-burned habitats had lower herbaceous plant density
   and species richness than those on burned ones. However, species
   composition and abundance in non-burned stands were more similar to
   those of primary forest, whereas several secondary forest specialist
   species were found in burned stands. In both non-burned and burned
   forests, distance from the forest edge was not related to herbaceous
   density and species richness. Overall, our results suggest that the
   natural regeneration of herbaceous species in secondary tropical forests
   is dependent on a site's post-clearing treatment. We recommend
   evaluating the land history of a site prior to developing and
   implementing a restoration strategy, as this will influence the
   biological template on which restoration efforts are overlaid.},

Abstract = {The lack of knowledge about seeds of native species constitutes a major
   challenge to their use in environmental rehabilitation activities. In
   this study, we analysed the morphology and germination of native species
   seeds found in areas close to Fe and Mn mines in the Eastern Amazon. We
   also evaluated the effect of scarification on seeds showing natural low
   germination. Seeds of 39 native species varying in ecological
   succession, biological cycle, and growth habits were tested. The
   pre-germination treatments of the seeds consisted of abrasion
   (mechanical scarification), immersion in sulfuric acid (90\%) (chemical
   scarification), and immersion in hot water (100 degrees C) (thermal
   scarification). The results showed that (i) seed size and mass varied
   greatly between species of the same growth habit, particularly in shrubs
   and trees, as well as within species, for nine species; (ii) an overall
   low germination percentage for non-scarified seeds; (iii) an increment
   of similar to threefold in germination percentage and 11-fold in
   germination speed after mechanical seed coat scarification; (iv) and 17
   of the 18 legume species analyzed showed low germination percentages,
   which indicates some type of dormancy. The size of the seeds had a low
   relationship with germination, being more related to the ecological
   characteristics of the species. After mechanical scarification, the tree
   species showed the greatest increase in germination compared to the
   other groups. The mechanical scarification can contribute to improving
   the performance of native species in the revegetation of mining areas in
   the Amazon, however, complementary studies are needed to better
   understand these species and optimize their use.},

Abstract = {The introduction of exotic species is considered as one of the major
   causes of biodiversity loss. The National Forest of Carajas is one of
   the largest mineral provinces in the world. Mining activities caused
   changes of the natural habitats, leaving degraded areas after the
   mineral exploitation. One of the mining areas within FLONA Carajas was
   used for the extraction of gold. In the process of exploitation, a huge
   depression was formed by the removal of soil which was mounded up
   nearby. To prevent soil erosion of these mounds, an exotic grass,
   Urochloa decumbens (Stapf) R.D.Webster (Poaceae) was planted. The
   objective of this study was to compare the impact of this non-native
   grass on species richness and species composition of the natural
   regeneration in the degraded areas. Four areas were compared, two with
   and two without presence of U. decumbens. In each area, twenty four
   1m(2)/plots were established. Species richness of the regeneration areas
   and population sizes were significantly lower in the plots where the
   exotic grass was present. Our study shows that U. decumbens had a
   negative effect on species richness and population density, and its
   presence changed the species composition and distribution of life forms
   of the natural regeneration.},

Abstract = {Forest regrowth is a notable phenomenon across the tropical forest
   latitudes. Such reforestation takes place in the wake of land
   abandonment, occurs cyclically in a rotational agricultural system, and
   may result from the deliberate planting of trees by farmers. Although
   less extensive than successional forest regeneration, tree planting by
   small farmers can have potentially important environmental impacts at
   both the site and global scale. This paper examines tree-planting
   efforts by small farmers in the tropical frontier regions of Panama and
   Brazil in order to gauge the magnitude of reforestation activities, and
   to identify factors that influence these efforts. This paper discusses
   the environmental regulations, forestry law, and tenure institutions in
   both countries, and performs a comparative analysis of reforestation
   efforts with information derived from household surveys (n = 356) and
   in-depth tree planting interviews ( n = 35). Results from logistic
   regression are also presented. Our results show that tree planting
   occurs more frequently in Panama, which we attribute to greater external
   support in the provisioning of extension and materials and strong market
   incentives. We suggest that the proximity of the study sites to Panama
   City facilitates external support and market drivers. Finally, our
   results suggest that land tenure security is an influential determinant
   of reforestation activities in both countries.},

Abstract = {What is the importance of open habitat in a predominantly closed forest
   to the dung beetle assemblage? The Atlantic Forest in Brazil is one of
   the most highly disturbed ecosystems and is mainly represented by
   fragmented areas. However, in places where human disturbances have
   ceased, certain areas are showing a natural regeneration pattern. The
   aim of the present study was to determine how the dung beetle assemblage
   responds to distinct habitat structures in a fragment of Atlantic
   Forest. For such, open and closed forest areas were sampled in a
   fragment of the Atlantic Forest in the northeastern region of Brazil.
   Pitfall traps baited with excrement and carrion were used to collect the
   beetles. A total of 7,267 individuals belonging to 35 species were
   captured. Canthon chalybaeus and C. mutabilis were restricted to open
   areas. Nearly 90\% of the individuals of C. aff. simulans and
   Deltochilum aff. irroratum were identified in these areas. A higher
   percentage (> 50\%) of Canthon staigi, Dichotomius aff. depressicolis
   and D. aff. sericeus occurred in closed areas. Abundance differed
   between areas, with higher values in closed areas. Richness was not
   influenced by the habitat structure. NMDS ordination exhibited the
   segregation of areas and ANOSIM confirmed that this variable explained
   the assemblage of dung beetle species. The findings of the present study
   validate that open areas are associated to more restrictive conditions,
   limiting a higher abundance of dung beetle. Although situated near
   preserved fragments, the studied open areas increase the heterogeneity
   of the general landscape.},

Abstract = {Many research projects require accurate delineation of different
   secondary succession (SS) stages over large regions/subregions of the
   Amazon basin. However, the complexity of vegetation stand structure,
   abundant vegetation species, and the smooth transition between different
   SS stages make vegetation classification difficult when using
   traditional approaches such as the maximum likelihood classifier (MLC).
   Most of the time, classification distinguishes only between
   forest/non-forest. It has been difficult to accurately distinguish
   stages of SS. In this paper, a linear mixture model (LMM) approach is
   applied to classify successional and mature forests using Thematic
   Mapper (TM) imagery in the Rondonia region of the Brazilian Amazon.
   Three endmembers (i.e., shade, soil, and green vegetation or GV) were
   identified based on the image itself and a constrained least-squares
   solution was used to unmix the image. This study indicates that the LMM
   approach is a promising method for distinguishing successional and
   mature forests in the Amazon basin using TM data. It improved vegetation
   classification accuracy over that of the MLC. Initial, intermediate, and
   advanced successional and mature forests were classified with overall
   accuracy of 78.2\% using a threshold method on the ratio of shade to GV
   fractions, a 7.4\% increase over the MLC. The GV and shade fractions are
   sensitive to the change of vegetation stand structures and better
   capture biophysical structure information. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {The ecosystems occurring on dystrophic soils, such as sandy soils, are
   highly dependent on nutrients from the atmosphere and those cycled by
   their own biota. Nutrient inputs from rainfall and throughfall were
   measured between October 2001 and August 2003 in a secondary Atlantic
   rainforest in southern Brazil. Canopy interception (rainfall minus
   throughfall) was 17.3\% of the annual rainfall of 2,235 mm. Monthly
   interception ranged from 12 to 31\% during the rainiest months
   (precipitation above 200 mm) and from 1 to 45\% during the driest months
   (precipitation below 50 mm) indicating relatively high variability
   during this period. The studied site may be susceptible to water stress
   in this period due to the high permeability of the sandy soil.
   Approximately 80\% of the Ca and Na and 57\% of Mg were mainly from
   rainfall (bulk deposition) whereas the main input source for K was net
   throughfall (about 78\%). Mean annual inputs via throughfall (in kg
   ha(-1)) were: 90.6 for Na, 29.1 for K, 7.1 for Ca, and 2.9 for Mg. The
   highest nutrient inputs occurred during the rainy season. Na fluxes were
   relatively high, while K, Ca, and Mg inputs were low, compared with
   other tropical and subtropical forests. Information on nutrient fluxes
   for different forest ecosystems are fundamental for building up a
   database that can give support to environmental diagnosis, to forest
   management, and to conservation and restoration techniques.},

Abstract = {QuestionIdentifying the factors that lead to the success of restoration
   projects has been a major challenge in ecological restoration. Here we
   ask which factors, aside from time since restoration began, drive the
   recovery of tree biomass, density and richness of the understorey in
   riparian forests undergoing restoration.
   LocationSemideciduous Atlantic Forest with tropical climate and deep,
   fertile soils, southeast Brazil.
   MethodsWe sampled tree basal area (DBH5cm), density and richness of the
   understorey (DBH<5cm) in 26 riparian forests undergoing restoration (a
   chronosequence spanning 4-53years). We assessed the following variables
   as possible factors, besides time, influencing community attributes: (1)
   planting design: density and richness of seedlings planted; (2)
   landscape features: proximity index measuring forest cover within a
   1.5-km radius, distance and size of the nearest forest remnant; and (3)
   environmental factors: invasive grasses, soil fertility, drought,
   average annual precipitation and proportion of fine particles in the
   soil. We performed correlation analyses including predictor and response
   variables, followed by stepwise backward regression (AIC), multiple and
   simple linear regressions, to investigate the relationships between
   those factors and the community attributes.
   ResultsTree basal area was primarily influenced by the proportion of
   small particles in the soil (+) and secondarily by rainfall (-).
   Understorey richness was influenced by the combination of size (+) and
   distance (-) of the nearest patch, rainfall (-) and soil fertility (+).
   Understorey density was primarily influenced by the size of the nearest
   forest remnant (+) and secondarily by invasive grasses (-). No influence
   of density or richness of the seedlings planted was observed.
   ConclusionEnvironmental factors and landscape configuration drive the
   recovery of tree biomass, density and richness in communities undergoing
   restoration. The most relevant ecological filters influencing
   restoration success are availability of soil water and nutrients and the
   distance and size of the nearest remnant of native vegetation. The
   expected influence of richness and density of seedlings planted,
   considered for many years as important drivers of forest restoration
   success, was not confirmed in this study.},

Abstract = {Evaluating leaf litter beetle data sampled by Winkler extraction from
   Atlantic forest sites in southern Brazil. To evaluate the reliability of
   data obtained by Winkler extraction in Atlantic forest sites in southern
   Brazil, we studied litter beetle assemblages in secondary forests (5 to
   55 years after abandonment) and old-growth forests at two seasonally
   different points in time. For all regeneration stages, species density
   and abundance were lower in April compared to August; but, assemblage
   composition of the corresponding forest stages was similar in both
   months. We suggest that sampling of small litter inhabiting beetles at
   different points in time using the Winkler technique reveals identical
   ecological patterns, which are more likely to be influenced by sample
   incompleteness than by differences in their assemblage composition. A
   strong relationship between litter quantity and beetle occurrences
   indicates the importance of this variable for the temporal species
   density pattern. Additionally, the sampled beetle material was compared
   with beetle data obtained with pitfall traps in one old-growth forest.
   Over 60\% of the focal species captured with pitfall traps were also
   sampled by Winkler extraction in different forest stages. Few beetles
   with a body size too large to be sampled by Winkler extraction were only
   sampled with pitfall traps. This indicates that the local litter beetle
   fauna is dominated by small species. Hence, being aware of the exclusion
   of large beetles and beetle species occurring during the wet season, the
   Winkler method reveals a reliable picture of the local leaf litter
   beetle community.},

Abstract = {Understory bird communities have been studied in a series of Amazonian
   rainforest fragments near Manaus, Brazil for about 20 years. Previous
   analysis of standardized mist-net samples revealed considerable temporal
   dynamism in capture rates, with communities in fragments responding to
   growth or cutting of the second growth matrix. This pattern was
   superimposed on expected fragment size effects among the 1-, 10-, and
   100-ha fragments. Here we extend our earlier analysis of landscape
   effects by separately considering 1- and 10-ha fragments, with the goal
   of describing the recovery of bird communities in fragments surrounded
   by abandoned second growth. Most guilds, with the exception of
   terrestrial insectivores, appear to be on a trajectory to return to
   pre-isolation abundance in 10-ha fragments Within about 40 years.
   Although some guilds showed similar recovery in 1-ha fragments, these
   were mostly species also common in second growth. Our results suggest
   that matrix development can allow bird communities to approach
   pre-isolation structure in fragments of at least 10 ha, but we emphasize
   that this conclusion represents a best-case scenario facilitated by the
   proximity to primary forest of the fragments we studied.},

Abstract = {Forests of the world sequester and conserve more C than all other
   terrestrial ecosystems and account for 90\% of the annual C flux between
   the atmosphere and the Earth's land surface. Preliminary estimates
   indicate that forest and agroforest management practices throughout the
   world can enhance the capability of forests to sequester C and reduce
   accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Yet of the 3600 x
   10(6) ha of forests in the world today, only about 10\% (350 x 10(6) ha)
   are actively managed. The impetus to expand lands managed for forestry
   or agroforestry purposes lies primarily with nations having forest
   resources. In late 1990, an assessment was initiated to evaluate the
   biological potential and initial site costs of managed forest and
   agroforest systems to sequester C. Within the assessment, 12 key
   forested nations were the focus of a special analysis: Argentina,
   Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Germany, India, Malaysia, Mexico,
   South Africa, former USSR, and USA. These nations contain 59\% of the
   world's natural forests and are representative of the world's boreal,
   temperate, and tropical forest biomes. Assessment results indicate that
   though the world's forests are contained in 138 nations, a subset of key
   nations, such as the 12 selected for this analysis, can significantly
   contribute to the global capability to sequester C through managed tree
   crops. Collectively, the 12 nations are estimated to have the potential
   to store 25.7 Pg C, once expanded levels of practices such as
   reforestation, afforestation, natural regeneration and agroforestry are
   implemented and maintained. Initial site costs based upon establishment
   costs for management practices are less than US\$33/Mg C.},

Journal = {TREES FORESTS AND PEOPLE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {15},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The environmental changes caused by human activities have considerably
   affected non -timber forest production, reducing the density of trees
   and palms widely employed by local communities to maintain their
   traditional livelihood conditions. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate
   non -timber sustainable forest production of a palm tree species
   (murumuru - Astrocaryum ulei) in riverine communities in the Western
   Amazon, and how human activity, such as livestock farming and
   deforestation, affects species production and regrowth in the forest.
   The forest inventory was realized through systematic sampling along the
   Juru ` a River margins, with the recording of height, diameter, number
   of bunches, and type of environment. The data were analyzed through non
   -parametric and generalized linear models with an adjustment of the
   Poisson distribution to predict productive potential. Statistical
   analyzes were performed using R version 1.0.153 software at a 5 \%
   significance level. The data revealed a positive linear correlation
   between height and fruit production, and a significant decline in
   productivity after 18-19 year. Natural regeneration was significantly
   higher in most preserved environments, such as upland primary (124.5/ha)
   and late secondary forests (97.4/ha). Late secondary forests (capoeira)
   also had the highest density of individuals per hectare (120.2) and,
   consecutively, higher fruit production (1.5 t/ha). Although the most
   preserved areas had more individuals and a higher productive capacity
   for murumuru, increased human activities are changing its forest
   structure, and natural regeneration, which can compromise the long-term
   sustainable management and local livelihood conditions.},

   forest. After six models had been compared in each forest type, the
   model with diameter at ground basis DGB and H was selected as the best
   for estimating AGM and TM, and the model with diameter at ground basis
   DGB as a single variable was selected as the best for estimating BGM
   considering the adjusted coefficient of determination and standard
   deviation of the mean. Models based on the diameter at breast height DBH
   showed poor correlation with each biomass component compared with those
   based on DGB for the open-canopy forest. The juvenile trees in the
   open-canopy forest showed higher AGM and H at a given DGB than in the
   closed-canopy forest, while the DGB - BGM relationships did not differ
   significantly between the open-and closed-canopy forests. It was
   concluded that the allometric models used to estimate AGM and TM were
   unique to each forest type. This would be because light-demanding
   species show higher allocation to AGM than BGM to be advantageous for
   competition for light by achieving rapid growth in height.},

Title = {The forest transformation: Planted tree cover and regional dynamics of
   tree gains and losses},
Journal = {GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {59},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Extensions of forest-transition theory to the tropics often depict
   sustained expansions of planted tree cover and corresponding long-term
   net gains in total tree cover. To explore the patterns and implications
   of continued tropical planted tree-cover expansion, we profiled
   sequences of tree-cover change over 1990-2010 according to Landsat
   imagery for recently observed (ca. 2014) planted tree-cover areas in 11
   tropical countries. Alternative patterns of change emerged from these
   analyses. Termed the `reforestation treadmill' and `forest
   transformation' narratives, planted tree-cover change featured
   relatively ephemeral planted covers, modest net gains, and similar
   tree-cover change dynamics compared to nearby agricultural-forest
   mosaics. Planted areas were characterised not by unambiguous
   reforestation but rather combinations of tree-cover losses and gains,
   with losses typically being more prominent. Contemporary gains and
   losses during 5-10-year periods regularly distinguished planted areas
   from non-planted areas, with losses being 1.5-2.3 times more common than
   gains. Planted areas were only moderately distinguishable from
   non-planted areas overall with respect to tree-cover change dynamics.
   Relationships between tree-cover change and the export orientations of
   planted tree/tree-crop commodities were also examined. Greater export
   orientations did not significantly associate with tree-cover loss or
   larger planted patches, with partial exceptions for Southeast Asia.
   Regional disparities in planted tree-cover dynamics were apparent. In
   Southeast Asia, dominated by Indonesia, tree-cover declines in planted
   areas since 1990 were relatively pronounced (20\% of planted areas),
   particularly with respect to progressive transitions from tree cover to
   cleared lands. Planted areas there were generally indistinguishable from
   nearby non-planted areas with respect to historical tree-cover change
   dynamics. In contrast, in South America, dominated by Brazil, tree-cover
   increases in planted areas since 1990 were more appreciable (at least
   14\% of planted areas), with most being progressive, stable, `net'
   increases (10\% of planted areas) and the remainder being dynamic
   increases entailing short-term losses since 1990 (4\% of planted areas).
   Total tree-cover increases within South American planted areas were
   equal to or greater than total decreases since 1990. These patterns
   suggest a forest-transformation narrative in which major planted-area
   expansion occurs alongside minor net tree-cover change. This narrative
   appears particularly well suited to Southeast Asia, where planted areas
   are extensive and expansive but where net tree cover gains are tenuous,
   reflecting political-economic shifts in forest management and the
   devaluation of extensive, degraded natural forests.},

Abstract = {Natural regeneration of Amazon forests offers a promising strategy to
   mitigate forest loss and advance the goals of the UN Decade on Ecosystem
   Restoration. However, the vast variability in regeneration rates across
   environmental gradients and over time poses considerable challenges for
   assessing regeneration success and ecosystem services provision in
   human-modified landscapes. Here we compiled 448 plots from forest
   regeneration in the Amazon to investigate the drivers of regrowth
   capacity and identify robust ecological indicators. By modeling optimal
   successional trajectories, we estimated reference values for vegetation
   structure, diversity, and functioning. After 20 years, successful
   regeneration should reach a minimum basal area of 14 m(2). ha-(1), at
   least 34 tree species per 100 individuals, a structural heterogeneity
   index of 0.27, and 123 Mg.ha-(1) of aboveground biomass. These
   straightforward indicators and reference values provide a foundational
   framework for governments and practitioners to assess success and
   establish targets for Amazon restoration efforts.},

Abstract = {The dynamics of the bird community in a small forest fragment was
   evaluated along seven years in relation to changes in the surrounding
   landscape. The study area is an Araucaria forest fragment in Southern
   Brazil (state of Parana). The sampling period covered the years 1988
   through 1994 and the mark-release-recapture method was utilized. The
   landscape analysis was based on Landsat TM images, and changes in exotic
   tree plantations, native forest, open areas (agriculture, pasture, bare
   soil, and abandoned field), and ``capoeira{''}(native vegetation <= 2 m)
   were quantified. The relationship between landscape changes and changes
   in abundance diversity of forest birds, open-area birds, forest-edge
   birds, and bamboo specialists was evaluated. Richness estimates were run
   for each year studied. The richness recorded in the study area comprised
   96 species. The richness estimates were 114, 118 and 110 species for
   Chao 1, Jackknife 1 and Bootstrap, respectively. The bird community
   varied in species richness, abundance and diversity from year to year.
   As for species diversity, 1991, 1993 and 1994 were significantly
   different from the other years. Changes in the landscape contributed to
   the increase in abundance and richness for the groups of forest,
   open-area and bamboo-specialist species. An important factor discussed
   was the effect of the flowering of ``taquara{''} (Poaceae), which
   contributed significantly to increasing richness of bamboo seed eaters,
   mainly in 1992 and 1993. In general, the results showed that landscape
   changes affected the dynamics and structure of the bird community of
   this forest fragment over time, and proved to have an important role in
   conservation of the avian community in areas of intensive forestry and
   agricultural activities.},

Abstract = {In this pioneering study, we evaluated variables that may influence the
   occupancy and detections (here interpreted as a proxy of intensity or
   frequency of use) probabilities of cattle and donkeys in a protected
   area in the Caatinga dry forest biome. No variable influenced the
   occupancy probability of cattle, which was high and constant at all
   sampled sites. Conversely, the occupancy probability of donkeys was
   positively correlated with the distance from the nearest ranch, which
   might be explained by the fact that donkeys are feral in our study area
   and thus, avoid areas inhabited by humans. The detection probability of
   both species was strongly influenced by the type of habitat, with the
   shrubby arboreal Caatinga being used more intensively by both species
   than riparian forests. The presence of cattle and donkeys within the
   protected area may represent a severe threat to the local biotas. This
   area is currently dominated by secondary successional habitats,
   resulting from the extensive degradation of its vegetation prior to the
   establishment of the protected area, and the incursions of these
   domestic animals may hamper the recuperation of native habitats, as well
   as jeopardize the survival of its native species, reduce water quality,
   and erode ecosystem services. We believe that studies of this type are
   essential and that the data they produce should be considered in the
   development of the management plans for protected areas to minimize the
   impacts of these exotic species on the native fauna and flora of
   Brazilian biomes. (C) 2019 Associacao Brasileira de Ciencia Ecologica e

Abstract = {The role of seed bank, seed rain, and regeneration from seedlings and
   sprouts after swidden agriculture was compared in 5-, 10- and
   20-year-old secondary forest and in a primary forest in Bragantina,
   Para, Brazil. The seed bank (0-5 cm soil depth) was largest in the
   5-year-old forest (1190 +/- 284 seeds m(-2)) and decreased nearly
   ten-fold with age to 137 +/- 19 seeds m(-2) in the primary forest. The
   highest seed rain was in the 5-year-old forest (883 +/- 230 seeds m(-2)
   year(-1)) and the least in the primary forest (220 +/- 80 seeds m(-2)
   year(-1)). Large plants (>= 5 cm dbh) had more individuals and species
   that regenerated from sprouts than from seeds and the most abundant tree
   species in the secondary forest stands of all ages appear to be
   maintained by sprouting. The smaller individuals (>= 1 m tall, < 5 cm
   dbh) in the 5-year-old forest were mainly from sprouts, but those in the
   older secondary forests originated mainly from seeds. These results show
   that at the beginning of succession, although many species can be
   introduced to swidden fallow from seed bank and seed rain, it is the
   sprout that is the main source of recruits of primary forest species in
   secondary forests in Bragantina.},

Abstract = {The replacement of native species by invasive species has caused a
   worldwide loss of biodiversity. This study aimed to evaluate the natural
   regeneration over time in a forest fragment invaded by Ligustrum lucidum
   W.T. Aiton and Ligustrum sinense Lour. in southern Brazil, in order to
   quantify this invasion. To do so, five transects were allocated in a
   fragment of Araucaria Forest in Lages, Santa Catarina state, with each
   transect divided into plots in different categories of distance from the
   edge and into sub-plots for the evaluation of the regenerative
   component. In 2012, the regenerating tree species identified in the
   subplots were tagged and classified according to height classes: Class
   1, plants with height between 10 cm and 1 m; class 2, plants with height
   between 1 and 3 m; and Class 3, plants with a height greater than 3 m
   and DBH (diameter measured at breast height) less than 5 cm. In 2014,
   these individuals were re-evaluated, counting the dead and recruited
   individuals and classifying the survivors and recruits into the existing
   height classes. Rates of mortality, recruitment, net change, and height
   class changes were calculated. The data were analyzed by a Principal
   Component Analysis (PCA) and contingency table. It was concluded that
   the species overcame the early stage of the invasion process,
   demonstrating great population growth in the study area. Also, a spatial
   partitioning between native and exotic species was observed, suggesting
   the existence of interspecific competition, the result of which may be
   the local extinction of species from the autochthonous group.},

Abstract = {The scale of forest and landscape restoration is expected to increase
   during the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration and its contribution to
   the provision of critical ecosystem services to society. Several models
   of forest restoration may improve ecosystem services, including soil
   organic carbon (SOC) storage. A review was carried out to access: (1)
   the variability of SOC storage between worldwide forest restoration
   models and, (2) the effects of climate, soil class, soil texture, and
   vegetation type on SOC storage. We reviewed 119 primary studies with
   information on SOC and soil texture for different forest restoration
   models. The restoration models were grouped into four categories:
   natural regeneration, monocultures, agroforestry, and mixed forest. SOC
   data was extracted from these four restoration models, other land uses
   (cropland, bare land, grassland, and natural forest), climate regimes,
   and soil properties. The SOC storage in the forest restoration models
   and other land uses at a global scale ranged between 0.1 to 514 Mg
   ha(-1). The overall mean value for SOC storage was higher for natural
   regeneration (112 Mg ha(-1)), followed by agroforestry (74 Mg ha(-1)),
   mixed forest (73 Mg ha(-1)), and monocultures (68 Mg ha(-1)). However,
   the average SOC storage was similar among the four restoration models in
   the moist warm climate zone. The SOC storage mean value in the moist
   cool zone was 23\% higher than the dry cool zone (81 and 62 Mg ha(-1),
   respectively), and 50\% higher for the moist warm zone when compared to
   the dry warm climatic zone (74 and 38 Mg ha(-1), respectively). The SOC
   storage of the restoration models was positively related to soil depth
   (0.59; p < 0.01), clay content (0.29; p < 0.01), and stand age (0.17; p
   < 0.01). Globally, the mean values of SOC storage were 26, 66, and 139
   Mg ha(-1) at zero - 10, zero - 30, and zero - 100 cm depths,
   respectively. In addition, sandy soils showed smaller mean values of SOC
   storage than medium to clay soils, especially in deeper soil layers.
   Furthermore, SOC storage was positively related between restoration
   models and other land uses (0.93; p < 0.01), suggesting a prominent
   effect of climate and soil properties on SOC. Forest restoration models
   showed larger SOC storage when compared to croplands and bare land, but
   in general it was smaller or similar when compared to pasture and
   natural forest.},

Journal = {SOIL SCIENCE},

Volume = {178},

Abstract = {During the past several decades, extensive areas of the humid tropical
   Amazon have been cleared for the introduction of pasture or subsistence
   farming and later abandoned after a few years of use. An option for
   recovering these areas is the planting of rubber trees because it is a
   native tree that could restore conditions similar to those existing
   before the clearing. In addition, the high economic value of natural
   rubber is a source of income for small producers. In soil management
   under the Amazon conditions, low phosphorus (P) has been the most
   limiting factor. Under natural conditions, P is provided to the plants
   almost exclusively by organic matter mineralization. The aim of this
   study was to evaluate a chronosequence of reforestation with rubber
   trees planted at different times in cleared areas, with primary forest
   as a reference. The amounts of litter and P content in the plant, in the
   litter, and in soil, as well as biological indicators (acid and alkaline
   phosphatase and P microbial biomass) associated with the P cycle in a
   Xanthic Ferralsol (Oxisol), in the Central Amazon were assessed. Rubber
   tree growth resulted in changes in total organic carbon, with an
   increase of 104.6\% in the 45-year-old rubber trees compared with the
   6-year-old rubber tree plantation. This was also observed for acid and
   alkaline phosphatase activities, which were close to those of the
   primary forest. The formation of litter and the P content of the
   microbial biomass in soil were higher in rubber areas. The P immobilized
   into microbial biomass was the main reserve to meet the plant's
   nutritional demand for phosphorus. The content of P available in the
   soil, regardless of the extractants (Mehlich 1, Mehlich 3, and Bray 1)
   and the age of vegetation cover were below the levels indicated as
   appropriate.},

   degradation. The natural regeneration of the caatinga has been the
   alternative adopted to restore soil fertility. However, the real
   effectiveness of this practice in recovering organic carbon (SOC) and
   nutrient stocks is unknown. This work evaluated the effect of natural
   regeneration of the caatinga vegetation on the restoration of levels and
   stocks of SOC, N, and P as a strategy to maintain the sustainability of
   the environment. We collected soil samples every 5 cm, up to 20 cm deep,
   in areas of degraded pasture, caatinga in regeneration (10 years), and
   regenerated caatinga (35 years) to evaluate the levels and stocks of
   SOC, N, and P. The depth significantly affects the levels and stocks of
   SOC, N, and P. Stocks and levels of SOC, N, and P were higher in
   regenerated caatinga > regenerating caatinga > degraded pasture. The
   regenerated caatinga increased SOC, N, and P stocks by 115\%, 110\%, and
   117\%, respectively, compared to the degraded pasture. Although 35 years
   of regeneration of the caatinga has improved soil fertility, the levels
   and stocks of SOC, N, and P remain low.},

Abstract = {Understanding the effects of disturbance on seed rain is critical to
   predict changes in forest species composition and diversity. Logging
   effects on seed rain in a mixed conifer-hardwood forest complex in
   southern Brazil were evaluated. One year of seed rain data were
   collected from a large-scale observational experiment in logged and
   protected forests and quantity and average seed size weighted by species
   abundance (CWM) were compared between old-growth and logged stands 55
   years after logging activities. Using these data, variations in
   frequency of functional groups of species in the seed rain were examined
   to see if they could be attributed to logging. Results show that the
   number of seeds per trap was highly right-skewed, ranging from 13 to
   12,788 seeds per trap in one year. Seed rain was affected by logging
   history, with seed traps in old-growth plots receiving significantly
   less seeds than traps in logged plots. All species included mean seed
   size weighted by species abundance were significantly smaller in logged
   than in old-growth forests. This difference persisted after the
   exclusion ofAraucaria angustifolia, a large-seeded pioneer which was
   intensively logged,although the difference of seed size between the two
   forest classes was greatly reduced. Species abundance in the seed rain
   differed significantly from the established tree community, between
   logged and old-growth stands. The composition of the seed rain was much
   more variable than the composition of the established tree community and
   its points more scattered over the ordination space than the points
   corresponding to the protected forests. The number of collected seeds
   across different functional groups of species significantly differed
   between logged and old-growth plots. The seed rain of logged forests
   reflects their arrested succession as indicated by reduced abundance of
   functional groups such as pioneers, large seeded pioneers andAraucaria,
   as well as reduced functional diversity. Seed rain differences between
   logged and old- growth stands reflect the intensive logging ofA.

Abstract = {Tropical Dry Forests (TDFs) have been broadly converted into pastures
   and crops, with direct consequences to biodiversity, ecosystem services,
   and social welfare. Such land use and cover changes (LUCC) usually are
   strongly influenced by government environmental and development
   policies. The present study aimed at analyzing LUCC in Brazilian TDFs
   between 2000 and 2015, using the north of Minas Gerais state (128 000
   km(2)) as a case study. We evaluated the potential biophysical and
   social-economic drivers of TDF loss, natural regeneration and net area
   change at the county level. Further, we determined the effects of these
   LUCC variables on socioeconomic indicators. We identified a considerable
   change in TDF cover, expressed as 9825 km(2) of deforestation and 6523
   km(2) of regeneration, which resulted in a net loss of 3302 km(2). The
   annual rate of TDF cover change was -1.2\%, which is extremely high for
   a vegetation type that is protected as part of the Atlantic Rain Forest
   biome since 1993. TDF deforestation was directly affected by county area
   and by the increase in cattle density, and inversely affected by terrain
   declivity, indicating that land conversion is mostly driven by cattle
   ranching in flat regions. TDF regeneration was directly affected by
   county area and inversely affected by the increase in population density
   and terrain declivity. LUCC variables did not affect welfare indicators,
   undermining claims from rural sectors that TDF protection would cause a
   socioeconomic burden for northern Minas Gerais. Our results highlight
   the importance of naturally regenerating secondary forests to the
   maintenance of ecosystem integrity and its services, which are
   frequently neglected in conservation strategies. Hegemonic macroeconomic
   policies affecting TDFs have been deeply rooted in deforestation for
   commodities production, and need urgent review because they cause
   long-term environmental impacts without evidence of welfare gains.},

Abstract = {Advanced recruitment and neutral processes play important roles in
   determining tree species composition in tropical forest canopy gaps,
   with few gaps experiencing clear secondary successional processes.
   However, most studies are limited to the relatively limited spatial
   scales provided by forest inventory plots, and investigations over the
   entire range of gap size are needed to better understand how ecological
   processes vary with tree mortality events. This study employed a
   landscape approach to test the hypothesis that tree species composition
   and forest structural attributes differ between large blowdown gaps and
   relatively undisturbed primary forest. Spectral mixture analysis on
   hyperspectral satellite imagery was employed to direct field sampling to
   widely distributed sites, and blowdown plots were compared with
   undisturbed primary forest plots. Tree species composition and forest
   structural attributes differed markedly between gap and non-gap sites,
   providing evidence of niche partitioning in response to disturbance
   across the region. Large gaps were dominated by classic Neotropical
   pioneer genera such as Cecropia and Vismia, and average tree size was
   significantly smaller. Mean wood density of trees recovering in large
   gaps (0.55 g cm(-3)) was significantly lower than in primary forest
   plots (0.71 g cm(-3)), a difference similar to that found when comparing
   less dynamic (i.e., tree recruitment, growth, and mortality) Central
   Amazon forests with more dynamic Western Amazon forests. Based on
   results, we hypothesize that the importance of neutral processes weaken,
   and niche processes strengthen, in determining community assembly along
   a gradient in gap size and tree mortality intensity. Over evolutionary
   time scales, pervasive dispersal among colonizers could result in the
   loss of tree diversity in the pioneer guild through competitive
   exclusion. Results also underscore the importance of considering
   disturbance processes across the landscape when addressing forest carbon
   balance.},

Abstract = {Key message Leaf traits in Atlantic forest are modulated by
   environmental filters and biotic interactions. More information about
   leaf traits and nutrient are needed. Categorizing tree species according
   to their relationships with ecosystem processes in the Atlantic forest
   (AF) biome is fundamental to better understand their functionality in
   this high biodiversity hotspot. For categorizing vegetation, leaf traits
   are extremely useful and this is the first compilation of leaf traits
   focusing on photosynthesis, water relations, nutrients, and functional
   diversity across major AF vegetation types: (1) rainforest (ombrophilous
   dense and mixed ombrophilous Araucaria forest), (2) seasonal
   semi-deciduous forest, (3) deciduous forests, and (4) coastal plain
   forests (restingas). Species showed high plasticity of photosynthetic
   traits from early developmental stages, including adjustments in Rubisco
   carboxylation capacity, maximum photosynthetic capacity, photochemical
   and non-photochemical quenching, specific leaf area (SLA), and
   chlorophyll and spongy parenchyma thickness. Montane rainforest tree
   species showed lower SLA and longer leaf lifespan in comparison to
   lowland rainforest species. Tree communities are structured by
   environmental filtering leading to trait convergence in early
   successional stages or in stressful ecosystems such as restingas, and by
   biotic interactions leading to trait divergence in later stages.
   Altitudinal gradients in litter production and below/aboveground biomass
   stocks in AF show contrasting patterns in comparison to other tropical
   forests, with important consequences for responding to climate change.
   However, the identity of limiting elements to growth still represents a
   critical gap in leaf trait data for AF species. Other gaps in knowledge
   of AF leaf traits are highlighted for consideration in future studies.},

Abstract = {Spec-mapping of territories was used to document the restriction of

   such thickets, but also used other habitats. These results correspond
   with previous, qualitative descriptions of the habitat preferences of
   bamboo specialists. At least four specialists are restricted to thickets
   throughout their entire geographic range (obligate bamboo specialists);
   another nine specialists may use other habitats sparingly away from
   southeastern Peru (near-obligate bamboo specialists); the remaining six
   species are frequent users of habitats lacking bamboo away from
   southeastern Peru (facultative bamboo specialists). The nonbamboo
   habitats used by the 13 near-obligate and facultative specialists are
   predominantly dense habitats with low canopy cover, including treefall
   gaps and early successional vegetation along rivers. The obligate and
   near-obligate specialists generally have small geographic ranges
   centered in southwestern Amazonia; a few have sister taxa in
   southeastern Brazil that are also bamboo specialists suggesting a common

Abstract = {The absence of human occupation sites in southeastern Brazil during the
   mid Holocene has been referred to as the `Archaic Gap' (89701940cal. a
   BP) and is predicted to have resulted from increased aridity. A ca. 14
   000cal. a pollen history from two well-dated lake sediment cores located
   within the archeological district of Lagoa Santa, in the State of Minas
   Gerais, southeastern Brazil, was used to test this hypothesis. Our
   analyses indicated that the present cerrado and tropical semi-deciduous
   forest mosaic persisted throughout the mid Holocene, until ca. 5500cal.
   a BP, and the Lagoa Santa region did not experience especially dry
   conditions during the Holocene period. The early Holocene pollen spectra
   contained an assemblage of cold-adapted taxa such as Podocarpus, Myrsine
   and Araucaria, co-occurring with taxa from cerrado, e.g. Caryocar. A
   replacement of cold taxa by the modern cerradosemi-deciduous forest
   vegetation took place progressively, but appears to have been completed
   by the mid Holocene. No evidence of sustained drought was found in
   sedimentation or forest composition, nor any prolonged dry event in the
   study region. Holocene dryness as an explanation for the abandonment of
   Lagoa Santa region is not supported by the palynological analyses
   conducted in this study. Rather it is suggested that unpredictable
   climate may have underlain that abandonment. Copyright (c) 2012 John

Title = {Monitoring ecological restoration of riparian forest: Is the applied

Journal = {FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {538},
Month = {JUN 15},
Abstract = {Ecological restoration is a process that helps restore a degraded,
   damaged, or destroyed ecosystem. Applied nucleation is considered a
   strategy that facilitates the development of vegetation, attracts
   dispersers, and, over time, tends to expand, coalescing into continuous
   forests. However, simply implementing restorative techniques is not
   enough, it is also necessary to monitor the process. Monitoring requires
   good ecological indicators, which is a challenge for ecological
   restoration. The present study aims to evaluate, through ecological
   indicators, the effectiveness of the applied nucleation for restoration
   of riparian forest. The study was carried out in the Serra do Sudeste,
   Pampa region, southern Brazil. Ecological indicators were analyzed in
   two areas of restoration: passive and active restoration. In the area
   under active restoration, paired plots were evaluated: intra-nuclei
   (inside the nuclei) and inter-nuclei (outside the nuclei). To assess
   natural regeneration, all regenerant shrubby and arboreal individuals
   taller than 30 cm were counted and taxonomically identified. The species
   were classified according to the dispersal syndrome. Shannon diversity
   indices and Pielou evenness were calculated. The canopy cover of nuclei
   and trees planted crown cover were evaluated. Ecological indicators were
   compared using Tukey's test (p < 0.05). The results showed a significant
   difference between passive, intra-nuclei, and inter-nuclei restorations
   for the evaluated indicators, with higher averages for intra-nuclei,
   followed by inter-nuclei and passive resto-rations. It is concluded that
   the intra-nuclei plots showed an increase in richness, abundance, biotic
   dispersal syndrome, canopy cover, and soil cover by plant litter and
   arboreal species. The applied nucleation is an effective strategy for
   ecological restoration in the study region.},

Abstract = {Estimating the contribution of deforestation to greenhouse gas emissions
   requires calculations of the uptake of carbon by the vegetation that
   replaces the forest, as well as the emissions from burning and decay of
   forest biomass and from altered emissions and uptakes by the soil. The
   role of regeneration in offsetting emissions from deforestation in the
   Brazilian Legal Amazon has sometimes been exaggerated. Unlike many other
   tropical areas, cattle pasture (rather than shifting cultivation)
   usually replaces forest in Brazilian Amazonia. Degraded cattle pastures
   regenerate secondary forests more slowly than do fallows in shifting
   cultivation systems, leading to lower uptake of carbon. The calculations
   presented here indicate that in 1990 the 410 X 10(3) km(2) deforested
   landscape was taking up 29 X 10(6) t of carbon (C) annually (0.7 t C
   ha(-1) year(-1)). This does not include the emissions from clearing of
   secondary forests, which in 1990 released an estimated 27 X 10(6) t C,
   almost completely offsetting the uptake from the landscape. Were the
   present land-use change processes to continue, carbon uptake would rise
   to 365 X 10(6) t annually (0.9 t C ha(-1) year(-1)) in 2090 in the 3.9 X
   10(6) km(2) area that would have been deforested by that year. The 1990
   rate of emissions from deforestation in the region greatly exceeded the
   uptake from regrowth of replacement vegetation.},

Abstract = {The region around Altamira, Brazil, located in the Eastern Amazon, has
   experienced rapid landcover change since the initiation of government
   sponsored colonization projects associated with the construction of the
   Trans-Amazon Highway. The 30 years since colonization (1971) have been
   marked by a net loss of forest cover and an increase in the amount of
   cultivated/productive land, particularly for pasture and
   annual/perennial crop production. This research presents a parcel-level
   model of landcover change for smallholders in the Altamira study area.
   The utility of specific land-use activities is calculated to identify
   those land-uses that are most optimal at each time point, and labor is
   allocated to these activities based on the availability of household and
   wage labor. The model reports the proportion of the parcel in the
   following landcover classes at each time point using a 1-year interval:
   mature forest, secondary successional forest, perennial crops, annual
   crops and pasture. A graphical user interface is used for scenario
   testing, such as the impact of high/low (population) fertility, the
   increase of out-migration to urban areas, or changes in cattle and crop
   prices. The model shows a rapid reduction in the amount of mature forest
   in the 30 years following initial settlement, after which the parcel is
   composed of a mosaic of secondary succession, pasture and crops. The
   nature and rapidity of this landcover change is the function of a
   variety of household and external variables incorporated in the model.
   In particular, the model produces different landcover compositions as a
   function of demographic rates (fertility, mortality) and agricultural
   prices. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Extensive eucalyptus plantations are observed in Brazil, especially in
   Minas Gerais State, which has this culture as a profitable activity in
   marginal areas. Trying to reduce effects of forest harvest on native
   vegetation and selection of some species as angiquinho (Mimosa gemmulata
   Barneby), this study aimed to evaluate secondary succession in
   eucalyptus stands of different ages and managements after exploration,
   the floristic composition and horizontal and vertical structure of
   shrub-arboreal was compared with fragments of Cerrado. The work was
   conducted in a representative area of this biome on Vale do
   Jequitinhonha. Phytosociological parameters and the indexes of diversity
   and similarity were calculated at the environments with initial and
   advanced recuperation, with and without eucalyptus. Control environment
   was Cerrado restricted sense. There were samples of 42 families, 99
   genera, 150 species and 1268 individuals. Floristic composition and
   phytosociological parameters indicated existence of families, genera and
   species of great relevance, typical of Cerrado. Removing eucalyptus at
   initial regeneration did not affect diversity. However, removing at
   advanced stage provided diversity reduction, permitting colonization by
   pioneer species as Mimosa gemmulata Barneby. On the other hand,
   maintaining eucalyptus at advanced recuperation resulted in higher
   values of diversity and other natural attributes. Results will subsidize
   management practices to be adopted in similar areas, aiming biological

Abstract = {Background and aims Restoring healthy ecosystem depends on recovering
   not only biodiversity, but also ecosystem processes and functionality.
   We investigated the effects of tree community parameters and site
   abiotic conditions on nutrient cycling in restored forests. Methods We
   assessed litter production and nutrient inputs in five 16-year old
   restored forests established using different restoration methods and
   species combinations, i.e. unplanted control (natural regeneration),
   direct seeding, agroforestry, mixed commercial species plantation
   (commercial mix), and high-diversity plantation, replicated at two sites
   that differed in soil fertility. We used adjacent seasonal semideciduous
   forest remnants as references. Results Restoration treatments with
   intermediate and high species richness had higher litter and nutrient
   inputs and did not differ from the reference forest. In the more fertile
   site, litter and nutrient inputs increased across different treatments
   with increasing stand density, whereas in the low fertility site, litter
   and nutrient inputs in the different treatments increased with
   increasing tree species richness and the proportion of putative
   nitrogen-fixing tree species. Conclusions Restoration treatments, even
   those with low species richness, but with a relatively high proportion
   of trees with nitrogen-fixing capability might be effective in restoring
   nutrient cycles in lower fertility soils, whereas in the more fertile
   soils it is possible to increase nutrient inputs by establishing
   restoration treatments at high stem densities. Our results suggest that
   the magnitude of relationships among plant community parameters and
   nutrient cycling depends strongly on site conditions.},

Abstract = {Effective ecological restoration actions should be able to recover
   ecosystem processes that influence community development in the long
   term. However, there is scarce information on how landscape factors
   promote or accelerate fauna recovery. We used a landscape framework to
   evaluate how functional groups respond to natural regeneration in a
   highly fragmented region of Atlantic Forest. Using bird functional
   groups sampled in 15 regenerating forest fragments, we built and ranked
   models using a model selection approach to test the relative effect of
   landscape variables on each group. Our results showed that bird
   community recovery is not determined by the duration of the regeneration
   process (i.e. forest age), but by how the species responds to the
   landscape context. Functional diversity and the abundance of the
   functional groups were mainly related to composition metrics, whereas
   the functional metric affected only specific groups. Our findings
   highlight the importance of considering the landscape level to ensure
   both the colonization of fauna and the restoration of ecological
   functions.},

Abstract = {QuestionsDo different growth forms have distinct temporal patterns of
   recovery of their structure, diversity, and composition in restored
   Atlantic Rain forest? Are tree and non-tree assemblages structured by
   the same factors?
   LocationAtlantic Rain Forest, restored by planting an assemblage of
   high-diversity tree species, Brazil.
   MethodsWe measured plant colonization of restoration sites of different
   ages to evaluate restoration success in terms of species diversity,
   colonization by non-tree species and structure measures among stands. We
   used Procrustes analysis to test whether the same conditions that
   influence tree composition influence non-tree composition (congruence
   between non-trees and trees present on the same sites).
   ResultsMany structural aspects of recovering forests, e.g. tree basal
   area, canopy cover, height, tree richness, and non-tree floristic
   composition resembled a mature forest within five decades. Although tree
   species diversity increased according to restoration age of sites,
   planted sites did not recover the richness of all growth forms even
   after five decades of restoration, and particularly lacked climbers and
   epiphytes. We detected significant similarity between corresponding
   points (tree and non-tree composition) from separate ordinations only in
   the reference forest. Therefore, naturally assembled communities are
   more concordant than those originating from active restoration.
   ConclusionNon-tree assemblages respond to different factors than the
   tree assemblages in restoration sites. Hence, non-tree recovery may not
   result as a natural consequence of tree recovery, and specific
   restoration strategies for non-tree species must be applied. Tree
   richness recovered after two decades. Only half of the non-tree species
   richness was recovered in old restoration sites, but their composition
   similarity reached expected levels of reference values. Further studies
   will investigate if low richness of non-tree species is a consequence of
   low input of allochthonous propagules (landscape filter) or whether they
   are arriving but not establishing (environmental filter). Enrichment
   planting of non-tree species may be required if the problem is propagule
   input. We recommend enrichment planting should be implemented within
   10yrs after initial restoration planting because of the need for trees
   as supporting structures. However, if propagules are arriving but not
   establishing, the solution is to detect which environmental filters are
   important and to manipulate them through forest management.},

Volume = {124},

Abstract = {The survival and growth of seedlings of woody species belonging to
   early- and late-successional stages are differentially affected by
   competition with the root system of Urochloa brizantha. Three trials
   were conducted to clarify such effect. First, seedlings of early- and
   late-successional woody species were grown in competition with the root
   system of U. brizantha. All seedlings of late-successional species
   survived and grew, and their ability to tolerate the competition was
   attributed to their long and thick roots. All seedlings of
   early-successional species died under competition, but 30-40 days
   earlier when the grass was mycorrhizal, compared with the
   non-mycorrhizal grass. The grass' root system seems to use the
   arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) hyphae network to increase its
   competitiveness with the woody seedlings, reducing their lifetime. In
   the second trial, AMF showed to be vital for three fast-growing exotic
   grasses (U. brizantha, Megathyrsus maximus, and Paspalum notatum) grown
   in a low-fertility soil. Conversely, in a high-fertility soil, the
   non-mycorrhizal grasses produced three times more shoot dry mass than
   mycorrhizal grasses. The growth depression of mycorrhizal grasses was
   attributed to the carbon drain for AMF maintenance. In the third trial,
   we excluded the effect of U. brizantha root competition using a steel
   mesh that allowed the passage of only AMF hyphae. Seedlings of early-
   and late successional woody species were grown around non-mycorrhizal
   and mycorrhizal U. brizantha which roots were confined within the steel
   mesh. The AMF hyphae associated to U. brizantha passed through the net
   and colonized the woody seedling roots, forming a common mycorrhizal
   network (CMN). The seedlings of early-successional woody species grew
   three-times more without CMN, suggesting that the CMN associated with
   the root grass increased the competition and anticipated the seedlings
   death, as observed in the first trial. Conversely, the seedlings of
   late-successional woody species were not affected by the CMN. Fine root
   traits of the early- and late successional woody species can explain the
   differences in seedlings establishment during below-ground competition
   with U. brizantha, whereas the AMF increase the competitiveness of the
   grass and make harder the survival and establishment of
   early-successional woody seedlings.},

Abstract = {The Atlantic forest is one of the most diverse biomes on Earth but human
   activities are transforming this ecosystem into one of the most
   endangered. Most remnant old-growth rainforest is embedded within a
   mosaic of regenerating forest, tree plantations, pastures, and
   agricultural production. This has left a large percentage of the
   region's endemic species threatened with extinction. Butterflies are
   considered as sensitive indicators of ecological conditions, especially
   in the Atlantic forest. This community can provide a window into animal
   response to restoration and how recovering habitats are used by native
   animal communities. The primary goal of this paper was to determine if
   butterfly communities respond to measures of structural recovery in
   naturally regenerating and re-forested pastures, and if this response
   increases the similarity of recovering butterfly communities relative to
   those of intact forests. Butterfly communities were sampled using two
   sampling methodologies, passive bait trapping and timed meander counts.
   These data sets were combined and correlated to assessment of habitat
   structure. We found that butterfly communities respond rapidly to
   structural changes in habitats as forest structure recovers on abandoned
   and restored pastures. While many species of mature forest inhabiting
   butterflies use regenerating forests as habitat, our young forests also
   retained an almost intact community of ruderal pasture inhabiting
   butterflies as well, indicating that these habitats retain many features
   of highly disturbed pastures. We suggest that measures of
   beta-diversity, which can be used to assess convergence in community
   structure, are far superior to the alpha-diversity measures that are
   typically used for assessing restoration recovery.},

Abstract = {Many modem landscapes in the humid tropics appear as a mosaic of primary
   forest, agricultural land and abandoned areas at various stages of
   regrowth. Whereas the hydrological functioning of primary forest and
   agricultural ecosystems is known to some degree, the impact of secondary
   forests on the hydrological cycle has yet to receive the same attention;
   this is particularly true for the effects of forest regrowth on soil
   hydrology. We investigated the effects of land-use and land-cover types
   representative of largely deforested areas of the Amazon basin on soil
   hydrological flowpaths by quantifying infiltrability and field-saturated
   hydraulic conductivity (Ksat) at two depths (12.5 and 20 cm) under
   primary forest, recently cleared secondary forest (prepasture), teak
   (Tectona grandis), pasture and secondary forests originating from a
   former banana-cacao plantation (banana) and from pasture (capoeira). We
   further inferred potential changes in the hydrological flowpath regime
   by comparing our results with prevailing rainfall intensities.
   Infiltrability varied (alpha = 0.05) among the cover types according to:
   \{forest\} > \{banana, capoeira, teak\} > \{pasture\}, with prepasture
   overlapping with forest, banana and capoeira. Although the
   infiltrability of pasture is lower by an order of magnitude in
   comparison to the other cover types, this decrease does not affect
   flowpath patterns as infiltrability still exceeds even the highest
   short-term, such as 5 min, rainfall intensities. Ksat at the 12.5 cm
   depth varies as follows: \{forest, banana, capoeira\} > \{teak\} >
   \{pasture\}, with prepasture being undistinguishable from the first
   group. Under teak and pasture, Ksat is lower than prevailing rainfall
   intensities, which implies the possible generation of a perched water
   table at a shallow depth and hence the generation of saturation overland
   flow. The impact of 13 years of cattle grazing prior to planting teak is
   still measurable even after 10 years of growth. At the 20 cm depth, the
   differences in Ksat among the land uses are minor compared to prevailing
   rainfall intensities, i.e., the vertical flow of water is impeded
   regardless of land use.
   We conclude that there is a considerable memory effect; hence, any
   assessment of the hydrological functioning of secondary forests,
   quasi-natural or man-made, must take into account the kind, intensity
   and duration of land use prior to regrowth. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {Protected areas by the law represent one of the strategies for
   biodiversity conservation, especially in regions under strong human
   pressure. However, many of these protected areas present barriers that
   prevent natural regeneration and knowing them becomes essential. In this
   sense, the objective of this work was to verify the regeneration
   potential of a restoration plantation carried out in a Conservation
   Unit, by quantifying the contribution of diaspores and the formation of
   young individuals. Seed collectors and natural regeneration plots were
   launched in a plantation carried out at the Fontes do Ipiranga State
   Park, Sao Paulo, SP. 54 species (41 arboreal) were identified and 24,033
   propagules (17,775 of the invasive species Urochloa decumbens) were
   registered and regarding seedling recruitment there were 58 species (16
   arboreal). The regeneration potential was still greatly influenced by
   the conditions of the area and the strong presence of invasive grasses,
   combined with the low diversity of tree species identified in the seed
   rain and in the recruitment of seedlings, had compromised the process.},

Abstract = {In light of the devastating loss of forest cover, biodiversity, and
   ecosystem services in the Atlantic Forest of Brazil, people are
   endeavoring to restore this fragmented forest system. The afforestation
   of abandoned or degraded land is a practical approach to restore
   regional ecological functions and to sequester atmospheric carbon to
   help mitigate the global imbalance of atmospheric carbon associated with
   climate change. Large gaps, however, remain in understanding the
   dynamics of afforested tree communities. In this study, the effect of
   topographical relief and soil properties on growth performance of
   planted trees has been assessed. Above ground dry biomass (AGB(dry))
   accumulation was estimated to evaluate the performance of afforested
   tree communities on formerly abandoned pastures at the Reserva Ecologica
   de Guapiacu, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The study revealed large
   discrepancies in AGBdry and respective organic carbon accumulationThe
   afforested tree community located on the sloped terrain stored only half
   the carbon (21.70 +/- 7.3 Mgha(-1)) that the planted trees on the flat
   terrain stored. (46.67 +/- 8.7 Mgha(-1)). Our results suggest that
   differences in tree growth performance are complex, depending largely on
   topography and related soil conditions. These circumstances should be
   considered to prevent misleading carbon sink estimates when developing
   regional strategies for Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and
   Degradation (REDD+) that promote afforestation activities. (C) 2014

Abstract = {Forest landscape restoration (FLR) has a central place in current global
   debates about the sustainability of natural resources, climate change
   mitigation and adaptation, livelihoods and biodiversity conservation.
   FLR approaches support the involvement of different social actors in
   participatory decision-making processes. We conducted a bibliometric
   analysis research to provide an overview of scientific publications in
   forest restoration, FLR and local stakeholders (LS) studies, and,
   specifically, examine if the studies (1) recognised the relevance of the
   local level actors and (2) collected primary and/or secondary data on LS
   using different methods from related publications since 2000. We used
   the Web of Science (WoS) and Scopus as bibliographic sources. We
   analysed five main research aspects: (1) publication year, (2) most
   productive countries according to the total number of publications, (3)
   most influential journals and cited papers, (4) most influential authors
   ranked by number of publications, their respective organisations and
   country collaborations, and (5) a co-occurrence analysis of countries'
   collaborations and keywords. We found that forest restoration, FLR and
   LS studies have been growing over the years, especially in the last
   decade. However, only 50\% (99 records) of the studies recognised the
   relevance of the local level actors and also collected primary and/or
   secondary data through different methods. Authors from organisations in
   North and South America, and Oceania were the ones with the most
   publications, with only 20\% (4 authors) of the top 20 authors having
   degrees in social sciences. Studies about ``ecosystem services{''},
   ``ecological restoration{''}, ``natural regeneration{''},
   ``livelihoods{''}, ``Bonn challenge{''} and ``governance{''} have become
   the main subject of research along the years within the scope of FLR at
   the local level. Finally, the results showed the gaps that should be
   considered in future research to improve the involvement and more direct
   participation of LS, as well as the participation of interdisciplinary
   and social science researchers in FLR research teams.},

   living individuals with a breast height diameter >= 5 cm were measured.
   The second inventory was carried out in 2015, using the same criteria of
   the previous inventory, thus, were incorporated the new individuals
   (recruits) that reached the minimum diameter of inclusion. The floristic
   composition changes, the mortality of the individuals was superior to
   the recruitment, there were loss of five species and increase of two
   species. The number of species and the density of individuals varied
   over time. The species that disappeared were represented by few
   individuals. The loss of species reflected in the diversity index of
   Shannon (H `) and Pielou equability, (H' went from 4.05 to 3.99 and
   Pielou J `equability from 0.83 to 0.82), in the first and second
   inventory respectively, even so, the values point to a high floristic
   diversity. The changes in floristic composition were not significant,
   the loss of species was related to the less representative in number of
   individuals, among the inventories the forest remained stable.},

Abstract = {We evaluated floristic and ecological changes in plant communities after
   disturbance in Southern Atlantic Rain Forests, in the Brazilian states
   of Rio cle Janeiro, Sio Paulo, Parang and Santa Catarina. We compiled
   data for 410 tree species from 18 forests ranging from 4 to 120 years
   after disturbance, and classified them by dispersal mode (animal vs.
   non-animal), successional group (pioneer vs. non-pioneer), vertical
   position (understorey vs. nonunderstorey) and geographic distribution
   (Atlantic Forest vs. widespread). We found that both geographical
   location and time since disturbance affect species distribution and
   P-diversity. Regression analyses showed significant, positive and strong
   relations (0.26 <= r(2) <= 0.63; P < 0.05) between fragment age and
   species richness, proportion of animal dispersed species, of non-pioneer
   species, of understorey species and with restricted distribution.
   Applying our data to values found in literature we predict that a forest
   needs about one to three hundred years to reach the proportion of
   animal-dispersed species (80c,/o of the species), the proportion of
   non-pioneer species (90\%) and of understorey species (50\%) found in
   mature forests. on the other hand much more time is necessary (between
   one and four thousand years) to reach the enclemism levels (40\% of the
   species) that exist in mature forests. our findings indicate that
   disturbance results in significant changes in species composition
   (decrease in endemic species) and ecological guilds (decrease in
   zoochory and in non-pioneer and understorey species), but forests can
   gradually recover over time spans of hundreds of years. (c) 2008

Abstract = {Two sedimentary cores with pollen, charcoal and radiocarbon data are
   presented. These records document the Late-glacial and Holocene dry
   forest vegetation, fire and environmental history of the southern Cauca
   Valley in Colombia (1020 m). Core Quilichao-1 (640 cm; 3degrees6'N,
   76degrees31W) represents the periods of 13 150-7720 C-14 yr BP and,
   following a hiatus, from 2880 14C yr BP to modern. Core La Teta-2 (250
   cm; 3degrees5'N, 76degrees32W) provides a continuous record from 8700
   C-14 yr BP to modern.
   Around 13 150 C-14 yr BP core Quilichao-1 shows an active Late-glacial
   drainage system and presence of dry forest. From 11 465 to 10520 C-14 yr
   BP dry forest consists mainly of Crotalaria, Moraceae/Urticaceae,
   Melastomataceae/Combretaceae, Piper and low stature trees, such as
   Acalypha, Alchornea, Cecropia and Celtis. At higher elevation Andean
   forest comprising Alnus, Hedyosmum, Quercus and Myrica was common. After
   10520 C-14 yr BP the floral composition of dry forest changed, with
   extensive open grass vegetation indicative of dry climatic conditions.
   This event may coincide with the change to cool and dry conditions in
   the second part of the El Abra stadial, an equivalent to the Younger
   Dryas. From 8850 C-14 yr BP the record from La Teta indicates dry
   climatic conditions relative to the present, these prevailing up to 2880
   C-14 yr BP at Quilichao and to 2720 C-14 yr BP at La Teta. Severe
   dryness reached maxima at 7500 C-14 yr BP and 4300 C-14 yr BP, when dry
   forest reached maximum expansion. Dry forest was gradually replaced by
   grassy vegetation, reaching maximum expansion around 2300 C-14 yr BP.
   After 2300 C-14 yr BP grassy vegetation remains abundant. Presence of
   crop taxa (a.o. Zea mays), disturbance indicators (Cecropia) and an
   increase in charcoal point to the presence of pre-Columbian people since
   2300 C-14 yr BP. After 950 C-14 yr BP, expansion of secondary forest
   taxa may indicate depopulation and abandonment of previously cultivated
   land. After 400 C-14 yr BP, possibly related to the Spanish conquest,
   secondary forest expanded and charcoal concentrations increased,
   possibly indicating further reduction of cultivated land. During the
   past century, Heliotropium and Didymopanax became abundant in an
   increasingly degraded landscape. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons,

Abstract = {Nutrient enrichment is increasingly affecting many tropical ecosystems,
   but there is no information on how this affects tree biodiversity. To
   examine dynamics in vegetation structure and tree species biomass and
   diversity, we annually remeasured tree species before and for six years
   after repeated additions of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) in permanent
   plots of abandoned pasture in Amazonia. Nitrogen and, to a lesser
   extent, phosphorus addition shifted growth among woody species. Nitrogen
   stimulated growth of two common pioneer tree species and one common tree
   species adaptable to both high-and low-light environments, while P
   stimulated growth only of the dominant pioneer tree Rollinia exsucca
   (Annonaceae). Overall, N or P addition reduced tree assemblage evenness
   and delayed tree species accrual over time, likely due to competitive
   monopolization of other resources by the few tree species responding to
   nutrient enrichment with enhanced establishment and/or growth rates.
   Absolute tree growth rates were elevated for two years after nutrient
   addition. However, nutrient-induced shifts in relative tree species
   growth and reduced assemblage evenness persisted for more than three
   years after nutrient addition, favoring two nutrient-responsive pioneers
   and one early-secondary tree species. Surprisingly, N + P effects on
   tree biomass and species diversity were consistently weaker than N-only
   and P-only effects, because grass biomass increased dramatically in
   response to N + P addition. The resulting intensified competition
   probably prevented an expected positive N + P synergy in the tree
   assemblage. Thus, N or P enrichment may favor unknown tree functional
   response types, reduce the diversity of coexisting species, and delay
   species accrual during structurally and functionally complex tropical
   rainforest secondary succession.},

Title = {Planning forest restoration within private land holdings with
   conservation co-benefits at the landscape scale},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {717},
Month = {MAY 15},
Abstract = {Forest loss is mainly due to the conversion of forest to agriculture,
   mostly in private lands. Forest restoration is a global priority, yet
   restoration targets are ambitious and budget-limited. Therefore,
   assessing the outcome of alternative decisions on land-use within
   private lands is paramount to perform cost-effective restoration. We
   present a novel framework that incorporates spatial planning for forest
   restoration within private lands with conservation co-benefits at the
   landscape scale. As a case study, we used three real landscapes of
   10.000 ha with differing amounts of forest cover in the Atlantic Forest
   region of Brazil, and three hypothetical animal species with different
   dispersal abilities. We estimated the total amount of forest that
   landholders must restore to comply with the Native Vegetation Protection
   Law, which requires landholders to reforest 20\% of their land within a
   20-year time frame. We compared the costeffectiveness of five
   restoration strategies based on the improvement in habitat availability
   and restoration costs. The most cost-effective strategy depends on a
   landscape's initial amount of forest cover and the species of concern.
   We revealed that spatial planning for restoration in private lands
   increased habitat availability up to 12 times more than random
   restoration, which was always the least cost-effective strategy.
   Cost-effective large-scale restoration in Brazil depends on public
   policies that assist landholders to comply with the law and on
   prioritizing areas for restoration within private lands. We show that by
   adding habitat availability as target in spatial prioritization,
   benefits for biodiversity can be hastened at low additional cost, even
   in real world scenarios with severe spatial constraints. Despite
   constraints, spatially planned restoration for law compliance in Brazil
   increased landscape permeability by creating corridors and stepping
   stones. Our framework should be used to plan restoration in Brazilian
   private lands and can be customized for other regions worldwide. (C)

Title = {Herbivory in southeastern Brazilian mangroves: An analysis of 11 years
   of litterfall monitoring},
Journal = {AQUATIC BOTANY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {186},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Severe defoliation of mangrove species is reported in several parts of
   the world. We analyzed the effect of a severe defoliation event
   resulting from the attack of a lepidopteran caterpillar (an insect
   outbreak) on the litterfall production. The attack occurred between 2009
   and 2010 in a mangrove in southeastern Brazil. Leaf litter production by
   different mangrove species between 2008 and 2019, was considered in the
   analysis. The infestation directly affected the species Avicennia
   schaueriana Stapf \& Leechm in all physiographic types assessed, with a
   decrease in leaf litter production between 43\% and 86\% since the
   monitoring began (2009) until the year when defoliation reached the
   maximum (2011). A decrease in the impact of defoliation was observed
   along the tidal flooding gradient, with more pronounced effects in
   forests located in the transition zone with the salt-flat, and
   progressive decrease towards fringe forests. In fringe and basin
   forests, leaf litter production by Laguncularia racemosa (L.) decreased
   between 52\% and 67\% between 2009 and 2011, respectively, and increased
   30\% in transition forests. Contrarily, the contribution of Rhizophora
   mangle (L.) increased 7\% in basin, became noticeable in transition, and
   decreased by 25\% in the fringe forests. The time required for A.
   schaueriana to recover the level of debris production was 8 years, and
   still reflect the effect of the severe, selective defoliation process on
   the dynamics and ecological succession of mangrove forests. A model that
   determines the stages of defoliation and their direct and indirect
   impacts on litter was developed.},

Abstract = {Applied nucleation and other spatially patterned restoration methods are
   promising approaches for scaling up projects to meet ambitious
   international restoration commitments in an ecologically and
   economically sound manner. Much of the corresponding literature to date,
   however, has centered around theoretical discussions and small-scale
   studies that are largely divorced from constraints faced by restoration
   practitioners. We briefly review recent academic literature about
   applied nucleation and other spatially patterned restoration methods and
   discuss practical challenges to their implementation. We offer several
   recommendations to move spatially patterned restoration from an academic
   conversation to scalable application, including: (1) comparing different
   planting designs and natural regeneration within the same system at an
   appropriate scale; (2) monitoring ecological outcomes throughout the
   restored area over sufficient time to evaluate recovery; (3) quantifying
   costs and documenting other logistical constraints to implementation;
   and (4) exploring methods for using unplanted areas to provide benefits
   to landholders until planted vegetation establishes.},

   the seed rain under their canopies. Seed rain was evaluated for 13 mo,
   from October 2009 to October 2010, in secondary vegetation of the
   Atlantic forest in southern Brazil. We used 60 seed traps (0.5 m(2)): 40
   traps under the crowns of 40 Myrsine coriacea (Primulaceae) trees (20
   male and 20 female individuals) and 20 at sites without trees. We found
   365 071 diaspores belonging to 115 morphospecies from 37 families, and
   38.3\% of the morphospecies were trees, most of them zoochoric. The
   female trees accumulated a greater number of diaspores and species
   richness than male trees. The male trees accumulated a higher number of
   seeds and species than areas without trees. This study shows that sites
   containing female and male trees of M. coriacea and sites without trees
   differed significantly in terms of seed rain, and there is a gender
   effect in this dioecious, pioneer tree species because female plants
   promote an increase in the richness and abundance of diaspores.},

   evenness, diversity of the seed bank and biotic and abiotic factors
   (e.g., canopy opening, herbaceous cover, and litter thickness), differ
   between bamboo dominated (B) and non-dominated (NB) areas. The study was
   conducted in a fragment of Semideciduous Seasonal Forest surrounded by
   an agricultural landscape. Soil samples were taken at 20 points in each
   area at two time periods, to evaluate the seed bank. The results show
   that diversity and structural parameters of the seed bank differ between
   areas and time periods. There was higher abundance and richness of
   seedlings of herbaceous ruderal species in area B and a greater
   abundance of seedlings of arboreal species in area NB. Sampling points
   in the bamboo dominated area had greater canopy openings and greater
   cover by herbaceous species, facilitating the establishment of
   individuals belonging to the families Poaceae and Cyperaceae, which
   could have competitive advantages over other species of the regenerating
   community. Considering that bamboo can affect the seed bank, long-term

Journal = {RESTORATION ECOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {31},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Tropical forests undergoing restoration can present high biomass
   accumulation rates, especially in the first 20 years. However, native
   species reforestations often present a bias toward fast growth, low wood
   density, and small maximum adult size species, contrasting with most
   mature forest species. Since tree species adult size and wood density
   are key traits that influence biomass accumulation, these induce
   uncertainty regarding carbon uptake capabilities of restoration projects
   in the long term. We compared the density of individuals (DI), basal
   area (BA), aboveground biomass (AGB), and weighted average wood density
   (WDW) in 13-14-year-old restoration sites and in mature seasonal
   Atlantic Forest fragments. We also assessed the contribution of pioneer
   and non-pioneer and planted and non-planted species on these variables
   at restoration sites. Furthermore, we investigated the DI and WDW for
   saplings and seedlings, in order to foresee changes in forest structure
   that may result from natural recruitment of dense-wood mature species.
   The BA and WDW at restoration sites were similar to forest fragments,
   except for large trees (DBH >= 50 cm). Restoration sites recovered AGB
   to the level of forest fragments only for the smaller size class (DBH
   5-19.9 cm). Planted pioneer and non-pioneer species accumulated the
   greatest AGB (93\%), BA (94\%), and DI (90\%) at restoration sites. The
   DI of non-planted non-pioneer species with higher WDW increased among
   saplings and seedlings at restoration sites. The presence of species
   with a larger adult size and higher WD may indicate long-term increase
   in biomass accumulation at restoration sites.},

Abstract = {Planting seedlings is a common technique for abandoned pastures
   restoration in the tropics, supposedly by increasing the seedling
   recruitment and accelerating succession. In this study we evaluated the
   role of a young restored forest (one year old) in enhancing seedling
   establishment from two sources (seed rain and seed bank), in the
   Atlantic Rainforest region in Southern Brazil. We compared abandoned
   pasture, young restored forest and old-growth forest with respect to the
   seedlings recruited from different sources, by monitoring 40 permanent
   plots (0.5mx0.5m) over 20 months. From the three studied areas a total
   of 392 seedlings of 53 species were recruited. Species were mainly
   herbaceous (85\%), pioneers (88\%), zoochorous (51\%) and small-seeded
   species (60\%). Seedling recruitment from the seed bank (density and
   species richness) was higher and dominated by herbaceous species in the
   abandoned pasture and in the young restored forest; on the other hand,
   the recruitment of woody species from seed rain was more pronounced in
   the old-growth forest. The young restored forest increased the species
   richness of woody seedlings recruitment from the seed bank (two-fold)
   and from seed rain (three-fold) compared to the abandoned pasture. Also,
   the seedling density in young restored forest was still higher than
   abandoned pastures (seed bank: four times; seed rain: ten times). Our
   results show that even young restored areas enhance the establishment of
   woody species and should be considered an important step for pasture
   restoration. Rev. Biol. Trop. 58 (4): 1271-1282. Epub 2010 December 01.},

Abstract = {We summarize early research on land-cover, land-use, and biophysical
   properties of vegetation from the Large Scale Biosphere Atmosphere (LBA)
   experiment in Amazonia. LBA is an international research program
   developed to evaluate regional function and to determine how land-use
   and climate modify biological, chemical and physical processes there.
   Remote sensing has played a fundamental role in LBA in research
   planning, land-cover mapping and in long-term monitoring of changes in
   land-cover and land-use at multiple scales. This special issue includes
   12 papers that cover a range in spatial scales from regional mapping to
   local scales that cover only a portion of a Landsat scene. Several
   themes dominate, including land-cover mapping with an emphasis on
   wetlands and second-growth forest, evaluation of pasture sustainability
   and forest degradation and the impact of land-cover change on stream
   chemistry. New techniques introduced include automated Monte Carlo
   unmixing (AutoMCU) and several new approaches for mapping land-cover. A
   diversity of sensors are utilized, including ETM+, IKONOS, SPOT-4,
   Airborne P-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR), and L-band SAR. Census
   data are fused with an existing land-cover map to generate spatially
   explicit estimates of land-use from historical data. Several papers
   include important, new field measures of species composition, forest
   structure and biomass in mature forest and secondary succession. (C)

Abstract = {The formerly wide-spread Araucaria angustifolia forests in S-Brazil have
   been cut during the whole of the 20th century and were converted into
   pastures, agricultural fields and forest plantations of pine and
   eucalyptus species. Araucarias only remained in small woodlots, groups
   or as single trees. Therefore, they were legally protected. The
   objectives of this study were to investigate the distribution of
   Araucaria seedlings in pine stands in order to consider whether
   Araucaria seedlings can be used for transforming pine plantations into
   mixed stands. Seedlings and saplings were detected in loblolly pine
   (Pinus taeda) plantations of a medium sized enterprise by means of a
   systematic large-scale inventory. Although the seedlings and saplings
   were heterogeneously distributed, they could be used for mixtures of up
   to one third of the area. The numbers of Araucaria seedlings and
   saplings were highly correlated with the distance to secondary forests
   containing old Araucarias as seed-bearing trees, with the age and also
   the number of thinnings of the sheltering pines. Nevertheless, the
   dataset was zero inflated, being the basal area of the pine stands a
   significant factor in this context. From the ecological point of view,
   it would be advisable to reconsider the strict Araucaria protection
   rules in order to encourage land owners to make use of the natural
   regrowth for mixtures with pines. However, this would also need a
   revision of the management standards for pine plantations, including
   longer rotation periods and early as well as intensive thinnings.},

Abstract = {Bracatinga (Mimosa scabrella Bentham) is an important pioneer tree
   species in Ombrophylous Mixed Forest of Brazil and is widely used as an
   energy source. In traditional agroforestry systems, regeneration is
   induced by fire, then pure and dense stands known as bracatinga stands
   (bracatingais) are formed. In the first year, annual crops are
   intercalated with the seedlings. At that time the seedlings are thinned,
   then the stands remain at a fallow period and cut at seven years old.
   The species is very important mainly for small landowners. We studied
   the understory species that occur naturally during the succession over
   several years in order to manage them rationally in the future and
   maintain the natural vegetation over time. Three to 20 year-old
   Bracatinga stands were sampled between 1998 and 2011. All tree species
   with diameter at breast height (DBH) >= 5 cm were measured. The
   floristic evolution was assessed with respect to Sociability Index, the
   Shannon Diversity Index and the Pielou Evenness Index. Graphs of
   rank/abundance over different age groups were evaluated using the
   Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. We identified 153 species dispersed throughout
   the understory and tend to become aggregated over time.},

Abstract = {Tropical dry forest tree species are recognized for their high
   resprouting ability after disturbance. We tested whether species that
   commonly produce root and stem suckers can be propagated by large stem
   and root cuttings, a useful method for landscape restoration programs.
   We performed four experiments: (1) In a greenhouse, we tested the
   propagation of six species using large stem cuttings collected from
   early successional sites. We used the following treatments: (i) dry
   season collection and planting; (ii) dry season collection, storage in
   humid soil, and wet season planting; (iii) wet season collection and
   planting; and (iv) wet season collection and planting after treatment
   with commercial NAA auxin. (2) Stem cuttings of Myracrodruon urundeuva
   were planted in a pasture during the rainy season after either NAA, IBA,
   or no auxin treatment. (3) As a control experiment, we also planted
   cuttings of Spondias mombin, a species known for successfully
   regenerating from cuttings. (4) Root cuttings of six species were
   collected in recently plowed pastures and planted in the greenhouse with
   and without treatment with NAA auxin. No root cuttings rooted. Only M.
   urundeuva and Astronium fraxinifolium stem cuttings rooted. Maximum
   success was obtained for stem cuttings collected and planted in the dry
   season (23\%). Only 13\% of M. urundeuva had sprouted by the 15th month
   of the field experiment. As a result, large cuttings are not recommended
   for propagation of the studied species. Future studies should include
   development of suitable methods of root harvesting and prospection of
   traditional knowledge for species selection.},

Abstract = {The edaphic macrofauna may reflect changes in soil use. This study aimed

   recovery of abandoned eucalyptus areas? For that purpose, we compared
   the composition and diversity of the edaphic macrofauna in areas of
   secondary forest, abandoned non-girdled eucalyptus plantations and
   girdled eucalyptus plantations. The secondary forest presented greater
   richness, abundance and diversity of edaphic macrofauna, followed by
   areas of girdled eucalyptus, with the lowest values found in areas with
   non-girdled eucalyptus. Therefore, the edaphic macrofauna responded to
   the management by girdling, through the stimulation of the taxonomic
   groups in the different guilds and can be indicated as a good indicator

Abstract = {In the present study it was evaluated the density of recruits in an area

   restoration and in a Semideciduous Forest. Was evaluated the effect of
   the available light on the biomass of the exotic grass, and investigated
   associations of recruit density with soil variables and understory light
   availability. The seed rain in both areas was also evaluated. The
   biomass of U. brizantha was positively associated with available light
   and, a negative association was found between recruit density and
   available light when considering the two areas together. A negative
   associatio between recruit density and soil pH was found. The results
   suggest that the low soil fertility did not limited recruitment in the
   semideciduos forest. The results showed that high resource availability
   favors the competitivity of U. brizantha, impairing the forest
   restoration in area previously used as pastures. So, pratices that
   result in decreasing in light availability would favors the forest

Title = {Chemical Thinning and Fisheye Clip for Managing Light Intensity in the
   Understory of Forest Restoration},
Journal = {FORESTS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {14},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Research highlights: Tropical forest restoration can be supported by the
   production of timber species in their understory. While they may appear
   at odds, they can be reconciled to promote environmental conservation
   and services. The lack of information on the management of tropical
   species causes a technical constraint for timber production in the
   understory of restoration sites, especially given the light
   restrictions. This issue could be amended with the development of
   methods to easily manage and estimate light availability, targeting
   management practices that balance restoration success and productivity.
   Materials and Methods: We conducted this study in an area within the
   Atlantic Forest, Brazil, where we tested the efficiency of chemical
   thinning to increase light availability in the understory of a
   five-year-old restoration planting, aiming to increase the growth rates
   of desirable timber species. Moreover, we tested the viability of using
   hemispherical photography taken with a smartphone to assess light
   incidence to assist restoration management practices. We calculated the
   percentage of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) using a
   ceptometer in four different thinning intensities and compared them to
   the smartphone measures using correlation analysis. Results: Chemical
   thinning increased light incidence in the understory, with potential
   impacts on timber species productivity. Light management through PAR and
   canopy opening were highly correlated overall, especially after three
   months of management and 60\% of thinning intensity. Conclusions: These
   findings demonstrate the potential for chemical thinning as a management
   practice to enhance light availability in the understory of tropical
   forest restoration sites. Additionally, our study highlights the value
   of using affordable and accessible tools like smartphones and fisheye
   clips for the indirect assessment of light conditions to promote natural
   regeneration and guide forest management and timber production in
   tropical forest restoration.},

   higher levels of stoniness, a recurrent situation in the forests of the
   Southern Plateau edge, while Cupania vernalis and Nectandra megapotamica

Abstract = {The brushwood is a technique of environmental complexation, which
   consists in the use of plant residues. This technique, when well
   established technically, can exert influence on seedbed quality,
   fostering native plant establishment and ecosystem restoration. In this
   way, we aimed to evaluate the efficiency of brushwood for the induction
   of natural regeneration of native species in an area covered by exotic
   inhibitory grasses of the genus Urochloa, as well as check the minimum
   size required to prevent the re-invasion of the forage. As a hypothesis,
   we adopted the minimum width of 4 m as sufficient for the establishment
   of natural regeneration prior to the reoccupation of grasses. The
   experiment was conducted between May 2014 and May 2016 in MorretesPR in
   a lowland evergreen rain forest area. Seven different sizes of brushwood
   were compared: 6 x 1, 6 x 2, 6 x 3, 6 x 4, 6 x 5, 6 x 6 m and control
   treatment. Woody species were identified and counted and herbaceous
   cover percentage estimated after 4, 8, 12, 18 and 24 months. There was
   no resumption of natural succession of native species. At any size,
   brushwood alone was ineffective to prevent the growth by grasses from
   the edges of the plots, and, since it constitutes a residue pile, it
   further complicates the establishment of woody species. For the creation
   of safe sites and consequent restoration by natural regeneration, there
   is a need for local elimination of Urochloa forages, without which
   native species are unlikely to survive.},

Abstract = {Riparian deforestation degrades stream habitats, altering fish
   assemblages' structure, and composition. In contrast, secondary riparian
   forests can recover stream habitats and fish assemblages as they recover
   structural attributes and ecological processes. We evaluated whether the
   amount and condition of secondary riparian forests were important to
   conserve fish assemblages in 49 streams sites in eastern Amazonia. We
   related fish assemblage taxonomic and functional measures to riparian
   forest amount plus different habitat metrics using regression analysis.
   We compared assemblage measures among reference forests, abandoned
   pastures (open canopy), and secondary forests (closed canopy) using
   ANOVA tests. The amount of secondary forests had little influence on
   fish assemblages. Species richness, diversity, and functional richness
   were higher in pasture than in reference sites but returned to
   pre-disturbance conditions in secondary sites. However, functional
   evenness was lower in pasture streams and did not recover after
   secondary forest regrowth. Our results show that secondary riparian
   forest condition is important to recover some aspects of fish
   assemblages. However, streams bordered by these forests may have
   impoverished fish assemblages because some lost sensitive species may
   take longer to return. Avoiding riparian deforestation is the best
   strategy to reduce losses in aquatic biodiversity and ecosystem
   functions in tropical agricultural landscapes.},

   after pasture abandonment in the Amazon region},
Journal = {FEMS MICROBIOLOGY ECOLOGY},
Year = {2020},

Number = {9},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {We assessed the impacts of forest-to-pasture conversion on the dynamic
   of soil microbial communities, especially those involved in the N-cycle,
   and their potential functions, using DNA-metagenomic sequencing coupled
   with the quantification of marker genes for N-cycling. We also evaluated
   whether the community's dynamic was reestablished with secondary forest
   growth. In general, the microbial community structure was influenced by
   changes in soil chemical properties. Aluminum and nitrate significantly
   correlated to community structure and with 12 out of 21 microbial phyla.
   The N-related microbial groups and their potential functions were also
   affected by land-use change, with pasture being clearly different from
   primary and secondary forest systems. The microbial community analysis
   demonstrated that forest-to-pasture conversion increased the abundance
   of different microbial groups related to nitrogen fixation, including
   Bacteroidetes, Chloroflexi and Firmicutes. In contrast, after pasture
   abandonment and with the secondary forest regeneration, there was an
   increase in the abundance of Proteobacteria taxa and denitrification
   genes. Our multi-analytical approach indicated that the secondary forest
   presented some signs of resilience, suggesting that the N-related
   microbial groups and their potential functions can be recovered over
   time with implications for future ecological restoration programs.},

Abstract = {The Fundao Dam breach, in November 2015 in Mariana (20o 22MODIFIER
   LETTER PRIME 40 `' S, 43o 24MODIFIER LETTER PRIME 58 `' W), was
   considered, at that time, the largest environmental disaster in
   Brazilian history. Meliponiculture was one of the activities pointed out
   as a way to promote floristic recovery and to generate income for the
   population, in order to minimise the impact of the disaster. The
   objective of this work was to identify the plants supplying pollen and
   nectar for Tetragonisca angustula by means of melissopalynological
   analysis in areas under the influence of the Fundao Dam breach. The
   palynological data were evaluated comparing to the floristic survey
   carried out in the region and using multivariate statistical analysis to
   verify the pollen similarities between the study sites and to
   investigate possible impacts caused on the bee flora due to the
   disaster. The pollen spectra of honey did not show differences among the
   study sites, since Schinus terebinthifolius Raddi predominated in all
   samples. Regarding the bee bread, two distinct groups were formed; in
   the areas affected by the dam breach there was a predominance of pollen
   from the pioneer heliophytic species of herbaceous or shrub habit such
   as Baccharis, Crotalaria and Mimosa pudica. In the non-affected areas
   pollen of Cecropia, Myrsine and Schinus predominated, demonstrating a
   more established environment in the ecological succession. It is
   suggested that the results obtained be considered in the restoration
   projects in the region to assist the development of stingless
   bee-keeping projects as a tool for environmental recovery.},

Abstract = {Habitat loss is one of the main consequences of landscape transformation

   is the first to assess the role of forest disturbance history on spider
   (Araneae) biodiversity in the westernmost portion of the Atlantic
   Forest. We analyzed taxonomic and functional aspects of spider
   assemblages in understories in a large forest fragment in southwestern
   Brazil. Spiders were sampled in five 30 m x 5 m plots over three seasons
   in three areas with different management histories: clear-cutting,
   selective logging, or native plots. We also characterized tree basal
   area, tree density, and canopy openness. The clear-cut plots showed more
   canopy openness and low habitat heterogeneity due to the high density of
   one pioneer native tree species. Forest structure in selective logging
   and native plots was similar. Spider richness, abundance, and functional
   richness were affected only by the season. Species composition also
   differed among the areas depending on the season. The abundance of
   web-building species was mainly associated with clear-cut areas in
   winter and spring. These results highlight the importance of natural
   regeneration in the Atlantic Forest after disturbance for the
   conservation of regional spider biodiversity.},

Title = {Adaptation of the century model to simulate C and N dynamics of Caatinga
   dry forest before and after deforestation},
Journal = {AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS \& ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {254},
Pages = {26-34},
Month = {FEB 15},
Abstract = {About half of the original one million km(2) originally covered by the
   tropical dry forest of northeastern Brazil (known as ``Caatinga{''}),
   has been deforested and replaced by crops and pastures. The remaining
   forest is constantly subjected to firewood removal. Besides that,
   pastures and cropping fields are often abandoned after a few years,
   allowing regeneration of secondary forest patches. These patterns create
   a mosaic of land use types and dry forest fragments under different
   regeneration stages, but there is little information about
   biogeochemical cycling in this ecosystem. Understanding the impacts of
   these changes, especially on carbon and nitrogen cycling, is important
   to define appropriate policies to preserve soils and vegetation and to
   contribute to reduce emissions and remove carbon from the atmosphere.
   Generating data about these processes require monitoring of large areas
   for long periods, and the use of models can be useful to improve the
   understanding of such systems. In the present study, the Century model
   was calibrated and validated to simulate the carbon (C) and nitrogen (N)
   dynamics in areas of caatinga vegetation before deforestation and during
   regeneration after abandonment. Calibration data were obtained in field
   plots in Paraiba state and validation data from plots Rio Grande do
   Norte state, both areas closely monitored for at least a couple of
   decades. Two types of deforestation practices were evaluated: clear
   cutting and cutting with stump removal followed by residue burning. The
   model files were prepared and calibration parameters were adjusted to
   represent observed values in the calibration site. Afterwards, the
   adjusted model was used to simulate the dynamics in the validation site,
   changing only the site soil and climate characteristics. In areas of
   preserved native vegetation, the validated C stock values of the woody
   vegetation biomass (21.0 Mg ha(-1)) were similar to the average values
   observed in the field (20.2 Mg ha(-1)). The soil organic carbon stock
   (SOC) (30 Mg ha(-1)) and its C:N ratio (11) were also satisfactorily
   validated by the Century model, indicating that the model can represent
   very closely the dynamics in areas under preserved forest vegetation. In
   areas under regeneration after deforestation, the model also represented
   well the C accumulation in the biomass of the secondary vegetation and
   the SOC dynamics for the different firewood harvest practices. The model
   is very sensitive to the type of deforestation, since the removal of the
   stumps slows down tree growth during regeneration, therefore it must be
   well detailed in the site management history during model runs. It is
   also important to create two different crop files for the herbaceous
   vegetation within the preserved forest or in the open deforested areas,
   because they comprise different vegetation types. The model was very
   sensitive to the KLAI variable, which controls the buildup of leaves
   during the young phase of the trees. After the necessary adaptations,
   the Century model simulated adequately C and N cycling in areas of
   Caatinga vegetation in the semi-arid region of Brazil. The model will
   now be a useful tool to better understand ecosystem functioning in this
   region.},

Abstract = {Throughout the world, plantations of tree species (native and exotic)
   for production purposes make up an important part of tree cover, often
   at the expense of natural forests. Monocultures of exotic and native
   species generally show a very distinct vegetation physiognomy when
   compared to natural forests. In the case of abandoned plantations,
   existing tree regeneration may provide a high potential for restoration
   of these areas. In this study, we evaluated composition and structure of
   the adult (upper layer) and regenerative (lower layer) tree component of
   natural Araucaria forest and of monoculture plantations of Araucaria
   angustifolia (Bertol.) Kuntze and Pinus sp., and their relationship with
   edaphic variables and sunshade discontinuity. We aimed to answer the
   following questions: To which extent do regeneration patterns of native
   species in the plantations resemble those in natural forests? Does
   natural regeneration provide a potential for transformation of
   plantations into natural forests? Does the exotic species regenerate in
   high abundances, and do other exotic/invasive species establish? Which
   environmental factors influence regeneration of native species? We
   expected to find differences in the species composition of the planted
   areas in relation to the native forest, and more pronounced in the
   regenerative component. Therefore, the soil parameters and the canopy
   discontinuity should also be distinct in the distinct vegetation
   formations. Density of species and tree individuals of the regenerative
   layer was significantly lower in the plantations, especially in the pine
   plantation, at the plot level. However, overall species richness was
   quite similar between vegetation types, with a total of 98 species
   distributed into 38 families. While light availability did not differ
   significantly, the soil parameters organic matter, pH, phosphorus and
   potassium showed significant differences among the vegetation types (in
   general, lower fertility in plantations). These variables were related
   to the specific composition of areas, indicating influence of the
   vegetation on soil conditions and regeneration patterns. Overall, we
   conclude that restoration of plantations into natural forest based on
   the existing forest regeneration seems possible, but should be done with
   caution and under monitoring.},

   plantings are still scarce. Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate
   whether pioneer tree species affect differentially the microclimate
   conditions of the understory in forest restoration plantations. Two
   forest restoration sites, with three and five years old, were selected
   in a semi-deciduous forest in Itu city, Sao Paulo State, Brazil. In each
   site, five individuals of five pioneer species were studied. In the
   three years old site, Luehea grandiflora, Schinus terebinthifolius,
   Solanum erianthum, Croton urucurana and Cecropia pachystachya were
   studied, and in the five years old site, plants of the species L.
   grandiflora, S. terebinthifolius, Apeiba tibourbou, C. urucurana and S.
   erianthum were selected. Each species was considered as a sampling unit.
   Tree species height and canopy cover, air relative humidity and soil and
   air temperature were analyzed. In the three years old restoration site
   no effect of species in microclimatic conditions was found. However, in
   the five years old restoration site, microclimatic conditions were
   significantly different among species. Therefore, the importance of a
   careful choice of pioneer tree species as ecosystem engineers which
   modify environmental conditions and facilitate natural regeneration in
   forest restoration projects was emphasized.},

Title = {Comparing contemporary and lifetime rates of carbon accumulation from

Journal = {FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {508},
Month = {MAR 15},
Abstract = {Secondary forests (SFs) growing on previously cleared land could be a
   low-cost climate change mitigation strategy due to their potential to
   sequester CO2. However, given widespread changes in climate and land-use
   in the Amazon in the past 20 years, it is not clear whether current
   rates of carbon uptake by SFs reflect estimates based on dividing the
   carbon stock by the estimated age of the forest. This is important, as
   differences between methodological approaches could lead to important
   discrepancies in estimates of carbon accumulation. Furthermore, we know
   little about how carbon uptake rates of secondary forests vary across
   some of the most deforested regions of the Amazon, where reforestation
   actions are most needed. Here, we compare the rates of carbon
   accumulation estimated over the lifetime of a stand (by stand age) with
   the contemporary rates estimated by recensus data, based on 28 permanent
   SFs plots distributed across four regions. Then, we compare how carbon
   uptakes rates vary across regions and how they compare to previous
   studies. The average rates of contemporary (1.23 +/- 0.57 Mg C ha(-1)
   yr(-1)) and lifetime (1.14 +/- 0.63 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1)) carbon
   accumulation were strongly correlated (r = 0.78) and similar between
   regions. Overall, our carbon accumulation rates were much lower than
   other estimates of Amazonian SFs, which suggests that regions with the
   greatest opportunities for large-scale implementation of SFs have some
   of the slowest rates of carbon accumulation. Contrary to predictions
   from chronosequence analysis, the lack of difference between lifetime
   and contemporary rates of carbon accumulation suggests forests are
   maintaining a consistent rate of growth in the first decades after
   abandonment. These results-combined with the high rates of ongoing
   environmental change - highlight the importance of continuing to monitor
   the rate of carbon accumulation in secondary forests. This is necessary
   to support the implementation and monitoring of large-scale passive
   restoration in the highly-deforested Amazon.},

Abstract = {In Brazil, many pastures are formed by grasses of the genus Urochloa,
   which have recognized inhibitory effects on regeneration of native
   vegetation. Using facilitation practices for natural regeneration of
   these areas aims to promote forest restoration by creating safe sites in
   the seedbed. This study aimed to assess the efficiency of brushwood and
   artificial perch as techniques to improve native plant establishment in
   an area covered by the inhibitory grasses of Urochloa. Field work was
   conducted between February 2014 and February 2016, in an area of lowland
   Atlantic rainforest in Morretes-PR. A set of 12 8 m x 5 m plots were
   established, corresponding to three treatments and four replicates,
   organized according to randomized block and split-plot design. The
   treatments were: brushwood, brushwood + artificial perch and control
   treatment. Evaluations were conducted at 4, 8, 12, 18 and 24 months
   after the experiment was installed by counting and identifying
   regenerating woody species and visually estimating cover percentage of
   herbs and subshrubs species. Brushwood treatments with and without perch
   initially reduced Urochloa grasses; however, over time the initial
   effects ceased due to the rapid growth of grass at plot edges. Likewise,
   perches in this treatment did not increase native/woody species. We
   concluded that the ecological restoration of Urochloa pastures requires
   additional measures to control grasses and increase local resilience in
   order to improve the seedbed.},

Abstract = {In tropical forests, several reforestation programs have been created to
   recover biological diversity in deforested environments. However, most
   of these studies have focused on the loss of species and ignored the
   loss of ecological interactions and ecosystem services that these
   species provide in their natural environment. Here, we assess how
   reforestation (including both native and exotic species) and the
   distance from the forest matrix could recover the following parameters:
   richness, composition, and ant-plant interactions in the southern
   Brazilian Amazon. For this, we collected data in five different
   agroforestry landscapes: primary and secondary forests, reforestations
   of teak and fig, and pasture. In general, we observed that the distance
   from the forest matrix was not an important factor for the recovery of
   ant-plant interactions at the scale of this study. Ant plant
   interactions were more specialized in the pasture, possibly due to the
   low richness and high dominance in pastures, which generates a high
   ant-plant dependency. Moreover, none of the strategies employed for the
   recovery of diversity (teak and fig reforestation) increased the
   recovery rate of the studied parameters: richness, composition, and the
   patterns of ant plant interactions, when compared to primary forests.
   These results indicate that regardless of species richness and
   composition, secondary forests and reforestation lands are functionally
   different from pastures. In conclusion, our results represent a valuable
   tool to conservation planners, mainly because we show that secondary
   forests created by natural regeneration can be an efficient and
   economical method for restoring the disruption of ant plant interactions
   in tropical forests. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Do abandoned nests of leaf-cutting ants enhance plant recruitment in the

Journal = {AUSTRAL ECOLOGY},

Volume = {36},

Abstract = {The role played by abandoned nests of leaf-cutting ants (Atta spp.) as a
   small-scale disturbance regime that affects plant recruitment, species
   coexistence and forest regeneration remains poorly investigated. Here we
   examine whether abandoned nests of Atta cephalotes serve as regeneration
   niches and operate as particular plant recruitment habitats, favouring
   forest regeneration after ant activities cease and leading to the
   establishment of taxonomically/ecologically distinct plant assemblages.
   Soil properties, canopy openness, light availability and regenerating
   plant assemblages were evaluated across 18 nests and adjacent control
   plots in a large remnant of Atlantic Forest in north-east Brazil from
   December 2004 to December 2005. Surprisingly, nests and control plots
   exhibited very similar light environments irrespective of nest age, but
   nest soils exhibited substantial reductions in carbon content (1.45 +/-
   0.24 vs. 1.79 +/- 0.13\%) and organic matter (2.50 +/- 0.41 vs. 3.08 +/-
   0.23\%), and proved to be much more resistant to penetration (30.57 +/-
   6.08 vs. 39.48 +/- 7.53 mm). Functional signature of regenerating plant
   assemblages exhibited little variation across both habitat types, as
   they were dominated by pioneer, small-seeded and vertebrate-dispersed
   species. However, abandoned nests exhibited less dense, impoverished and
   more homogeneous regenerating plant assemblages at local and landscape
   scale; they clearly lacked nest-dependent plant species and represented
   floristic subsets of the flora inhabiting the undisturbed forest. This
   recruitment bottleneck was transient in the long term because
   nest-related effects ameliorated in older nests. Our results suggest
   that, unlike treefall gaps, abandoned nests represent temporary
   (relatively long-lasting) islands of unsuitable substrate that reduce
   plant recruitment, retard forest regeneration, and fail in providing a
   special regeneration niche able to promote species coexistence and plant
   diversity.},

Abstract = {The population awareness about environmental conservation is raising and
   this brought about an increase in the number of environmental
   restoration studies. Nucleation is a technique used for environmental
   restoration, where small nuclei of vegetation are established within
   degraded land. The aim of this paper was to evaluate, by doing a
   bibliometric analysis, the tendencies and gaps in the study of
   environmental restoration using the nucleation technique. Data were
   collected using The Web of Science (c) and Google Scholar (c) databases,
   from 1996 to 2012. Keywords used in the search of papers were
   nucleation, soil recovery, transposition of soil, bird perches,
   ecological succession, seed rain, restoration ecology, forest
   regeneration, degraded area and natural regeneration. Results showed
   that the number of published studies was low, although increasing in the
   last decade. The majority of the studies used more than one restoration
   technique or used natural perches as nuclei. Most of the studies were
   conducted in the Americas and by Brazilian researches. Many studies were
   not published as papers in scientific journals, but were available as
   master thesis or monographs. Natural and artificial perches, soil
   transposition and natural regeneration were the most successful
   techniques. The number of nucleation studies must increase and spread
   through the world, and their results need to be published to help other
   researches in the environmental restoration. (C) 2014 Associacao

   erythropappus, Asteraceae)},
Journal = {GENETICS AND MOLECULAR RESEARCH},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {7},

Pages = {388-398},
Abstract = {Eremanthus erythropappus, commonly known as ``candeia{''}, is an
   abundant pioneer tree species, forming dense populations known as
   ``candeial{''}, but it is also found in forests at middle stages of
   succession. Trees from forests are bigger and occur in lower density
   than in the ``candeial{''}. The objectives of the present study were to
   investigate if the decrease in population density during successional
   process is accompanied by 1) changes in within-population genetic
   diversity, and 2) differentiation of populations. Eight populations,
   four of early successional stage ({''}candeial{''}) and four of middle
   successional stages (forest), were analyzed with RAPD markers. The
   genetic diversity found was high compared to other tree species analyzed
   with RAPD markers. AMOVA revealed that most of the genetic variations of
   E. erythropappus were found within populations (85.7\%), suggesting that
   this species is predominantly outcrossing. The relatively low
   differentiation among the populations can be attributed to small
   distances among the populations analyzed (0.2 to 10.8 km). No indication
   that populations from middle successional habitats show lower genetic
   variation than populations from early successional stages was found. The
   percentage of polymorphic fragments (82.8 and 84.8\%) and the Shannon
   indexes (0.442 and 0.455) were similar in ``candeial{''} and forest,
   respectively. These results suggest that if an increase in selection
   intensity occurred during succession, it did not result in a decrease in
   genetic diversity or that the selection effect was balanced by other
   factors, such as gene flow. Higher significant differentiation among E.
   erythropappus populations from ``candeial{''} in relation to that among
   populations from forest was also not detected.},

Year = {2020},

Abstract = {With urbanisation rapidly transforming our world, a better understanding
   of how urban ecosystems can contribute to biodiversity conservation is
   urgently needed. Here, we investigated the functional composition and
   diversity of plant assemblages in different types of urban forests with
   the intent to predict the stability of the functions provided by these
   forests through the functional redundancy and response diversity of
   species. For this, we used data from non-urban mature forests, remnant
   urban forests, urban forests regenerated from croplands and urban
   forests regenerated from soil denudation, all located in the Brazilian
   Atlantic Forest. Our results showed that species functional composition
   shifted among urban and non-urban forests. However, functional diversity
   was lost only in urban forests with some previous use, indicating that
   the natural regeneration of urban forests after previous land use
   results in functionally poor forests. Urban forests regenerated from
   soil denudation (more intense disturbance) had a lower functional
   diversity. Conversely, urban forests regenerated from cropland (less
   intense disturbance) showed only a reduction in the number of functions
   provided. Our analysis also revealed the reduced functional redundancy
   and response diversity of urban forests with previous land use, which
   may indicate a greater vulnerability of the functions provided by these
   forests. Thus, we emphasise in this study the importance of land use
   history for decision making in urban forest conservation policies and
   highlight the crucial role of natural remnant urban forests as
   reservoirs of functional diversity and stability in highly degraded and
   fragmented landscapes.},

   in 15 plots distributed in early, intermediate and late stages of
   succession (five plots per stage) at the Parque Estadual da Mata Seca,
   Brazil. At each sample point, unbaited pitfall traps were installed in
   hypogaeic, epigaeic and arboreal strata. We collected 95 ant species
   from 26 genera and nine subfamilies. Our results indicated that there
   was an increase in species richness in advanced stages of succession. We
   also observed that ant assemblages were different among successional
   stages. For the arboreal and epigaeic strata, species richness did not
   change with succession progression, but species composition of these two
   strata differed among successional stages. Unlike to arboreal and
   epigaeic ants, hypogaiec ant species richness was higher in the
   intermediate and late stages of succession and the composition of
   hypogaeic ants differed among successional stages. Similarity between
   ant species foraging in arboreal and epigaeic strata decreases with
   succession progression and beta-diversity was higher in advanced
   successional stages. Additionally, species richness was higher in the
   dry season, whereas the composition of ant assemblages did not change
   between seasons. A considerable fraction of the ant assemblage was found
   only in advanced stages of succession, demonstrating the importance of
   secondary habitats in maintaining biodiversity in dry forests.},

Abstract = {The site of Morro Grande, situated in the Araruama region, southeastern
   Brazil (22A(0)47'07aEuro(3)S, 42A(0)21'49aEuro(3)W), is in the Atlantic
   rainforest phytogeographical domain. It is attributed to proto-Tupinamba
   agriculturalist and ceramicist populations, recognized by their typical
   polychrome ceramics. Four periods of occupation were identified at this
   site: (1) 3,220-2,840 cal b.p.; (2) 3,000-2,150 cal b.p.; (3)
   1,820-1,390 cal b.p.; and (4) c. 750 cal. b.p. Analysis of 3,908
   charcoal fragments from the three earlier periods has allowed the
   identification of 78 taxa and 29 plant families. This work demonstrates
   the permanence of the Atlantic rainforest in the region between 3,220
   and 1,390 cal b.p., confirming previous palaeoenvironmental studies in
   southeastern and southern Brazil. The existence of mature forests is
   demonstrated; however, firewood was collected mainly from secondary
   vegetation, probably in the area surrounding the settlement or from
   cultivated land. These results provide further evidence of human
   influence on Neotropical rainforests. Creation of secondary
   environments, however, did not result in irreversible damage to local
   biodiversity, since the forest tended to regenerate after the clearings

Abstract = {In order to evaluate the regeneration of a forest remnant, we installed
   256 2 x 2 m plots for measuring forest species individuals with height
   >= 30 cm and stem diameter <= 1 cm. Horizontal structure was evaluated
   and calculated by the Shannon (H') diversity index and the Pielou (J)
   evenness index. We performed clustering analysis by the agglomerative
   and divisive hierarchical method (the variable was the number of
   individuals); and used the Principal Component Analysis to verify the
   species distribution. We sampled 3021 individuals, distributed in 26
   families and 51 species (H' = 2.78 and J = 0.66). Allophylus edulis had
   the highest values of absolute frequency (63.3) and absolute density
   (5186 ind.ha-1), while Ligustrum lucidum presented greater

Abstract = {This study discusses the population structure and management potential
   of Brazil nut in two Amazonian regions (Acre and Amapa). We surveyed
   density, diameter distribution, and canopy variables. Diameter of 1.3m
   soil (DAP), crown form and position, presence of vines and reproductive
   status were evaluated for each Brazil nut tree (dbh >= 10 cm) in 9 ha.
   permanent plots. In each State, we surveyed six plots, totaling 108 ha.
   The density and distribution of individuals in diameter class were
   determined by region and within each region (sites). In total, 610
   Brazil nut trees were mapped: 124 in Alto Acre and 486 in Alto Cajari.
   In Alto Cajari Brazil nut tree density was four times higher than in
   Alto Acre. Alto Cajari had Brazil nut trees with better features for
   fruit production as crown form and position, as well as lower incidence
   of vines in the crowns. In terms of population structure, Sororoca had
   recent problems with Brazil nut trees regeneration or change of natural
   regeneration dynamics over time, perhaps because it is an area of
   savanna-forest transition. Both regions (Alto Acre e Alto Cajari) showed
   Brazil nut stands with a good potential for management. However, there
   were specific needs for silvicultural treatments. Sororoca (AP) needs to
   improve recruitment of new Brazil nut trees and Filipinas (AC) is in
   need of vine cutting.},

Month = {FEB 9},
Abstract = {Degraded Amazonian forests can take decades to recover and the
   ecological results of natural regeneration are still uncertain. Here we
   use field data collected across 15 lowland Amazon smallholder properties
   to examine the relationships between forest structure, mammal diversity,
   regrowth type, regrowth age, topography and hydrology. Forest structure
   was quantified together with mammal diversity in 30 paired
   regrowth-control plots. Forest regrowth stage was classified into three
   groups: late second-regrowth, early second-regrowth and abandoned
   pasture. Basal area in regrowth plots remained less than half that
   recorded in control plots even after 20-25 years. Although basal area
   did increase in sequence from pasture, early to late-regrowth plots,
   there was a significant decline in basal area of late-regrowth control
   plots associated with a decline in the proportion of large trees.
   Variation in different forest structure responses was explained by
   contrasting variables, with the proportion of small trees (DBH<20 cm)
   most strongly explained by topography (altitude and slope) whereas the
   proportion of large trees (DBH>60 cm) was explained by plot type
   (control vs. regrowth) and regrowth class. These findings support calls
   for increased efforts to actively conserve large trees to avoid
   retrogressive succession around edges of degraded Amazon forests.},

Abstract = {The Atlantic Forest is a conservation hotspot due to its elevated level
   of biodiversity and current state of degradation. Some areas of Atlantic
   Forest have been replaced by eucalyptus monocultures in Brazil. Soil
   arthropods can be important indicators for assessing the recomposition
   of native forests after disturbs. This study aimed to test the
   hypothesis that exist differences in the composition and structure of
   soil arthropod communities among two plantations of eucalyptus (Corymbia
   citriodora) in different stages of natural regeneration of Atlantic
   forest (YP = Young Plantation and MP = Mature Plantation, in less and
   more advanced stage of regeneration, respectively) and a fragment of
   Atlantic forest (FOREST), in wet and dry seasons, in Uniao Biological
   Reserve, Brazil, using pitfalls. Archaeognatha, Diplura, Opilionida, and
   Thysanura were restricted to the FOREST, while Diptera, Isoptera, and
   Orthoptera were favored by the microclimatic conditions in eucalyptus
   plantations. Soil arthropod community in FOREST was more complex than
   those in eucalyptus plantations. In general, soil arthropod communities
   showed higher total abundance and richness of groups, while equability
   decreased, as regeneration of Atlantic forest advanced in eucalyptus
   plantations, making this community more similar to that observed in the
   FOREST. The average total abundance, average richness, and total
   richness of soil arthropods were higher in the wet season in all areas,
   but the opposite occurred for the equability. Soil arthropod community
   improved with the regeneration of native forest species under the
   eucalyptus plantations.},

Abstract = {Forest concessions were implemented in Brazil as a way to increase the
   areas of sustainable forest management. Little is known about the
   financial viability of forest management in Brazil, which is one of its
   main bottlenecks. In this context, the aim of the study was to evaluate
   the financial viability of an investment in forest concession. In order
   to do so, the Net Present Value (NPV), Periodic Equivalent Benefit
   (PEB), Internal Rate of Return (IRR) and Real Options Analysis (ROA)
   were adopted, and the option of abandonment was also analyzed. As a
   variable for ROA analysis, the productivity (m(3).ha(-1)) at the first
   years of forest concession under study was adopted. The NPV of the
   investment corresponds to US\$ 8.04.m(-3), the PEB was US\$
   0.52.m(-3).year(-1 )and the IRR, 20.75\%. In order to be considered
   feasible, the forest concession must have a minimum productivity of
   17.75 m(3).ha(-1). Of the 861 managerial decisions, the option to
   proceed with the investment was adopted in 237 nodes (27.53\%), and the
   decision to abandon was exercised in 624 nodes (72.47\%). This is a
   worrying result for the concessionaire companies and also for the
   management entities of the forest concessions, mainly when comparing
   with the concessions reality, where abandonment is an option that has
   been performed. It can be concluded that the high probability of
   abandoning highlights a fragility of forest concessions. ROA proved to
   be a good methodology to complement traditional methods of financial
   analysis, presenting satisfactory results in aiding decision-making.},

Abstract = {Tropsoil translocation has been effective for the restoration of plant
   communities, but until recently this method had not been used for
   tropical dry forest restoration. We tested different methods of topsoil
   deposition for restoring a dry forest on an abandoned limestone quarry.
   We also tested the effects of irrigation during the first dry season
   after topsoil deposition. The study was conducted in the Federal
   District of Brazil. A 2.1-ha area was cleared of vegetation, and the
   topsoil from that site was deposited on an exotic pasture field 1.4 km
   away. First, a secondary forest was clear-cut, and the first 30 cm of
   topsoil were removed and translocated. The soil was transported in dump
   trucks to the deposition site, which had been scarified in advance, and
   deposited by either forming 1.25-m-tall mounds or by leveling the soil
   into a 40-cm or 20-cm deep layer using a hydraulic excavator. The seed
   bank and the availability of root and stem fragments in the soil were
   both surveyed. The origin of the regenerants was categorized as either
   from seed or resprouting. We estimated vegetation cover for each life
   form, and measured all trees and lianas. After six months, 74\% of the
   tree individuals and 60\% of the liana individuals came from
   resprouting. Ruderal herbs and shrubs germinated from seeds. After 28
   months, there were 51 species of trees, 8 species of lianas, 12 species
   of shrubs, and 34 species of herbs in the deposition treatments. The
   three deposition treatments were thickly covered with herbaceous/shrubby
   species, and had nine times the number of species (44 vs. 5) and five
   times the tree density (1.17 ind./m(2) vs. 0.25 ind./m(2)) as the non
   deposition control. Tree survival was relatively high in both the
   non-irrigated and irrigated treatments. The total cost of topsoil
   translocation was 9604 USD, and the output was 0.43 ha deposited/ha
   excavated when forming mounds of soil, 5951 USD and output of 0.75 when
   leveling to a 40-cm layer, and 3551 USD and 1.5 for a 20-cm layer of
   deposited material. However, deposition and transportation costs are
   fixed costs of establishing a new quarry that can be deducted from the
   total cost of restoration. Topsoil translocation was effective in
   kick-starting the succession process of a tropical dry forest. (C) 2017

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Direct seeding has been considered a cost-effective system for
   ecological restoration with tree species, compared to planting
   nursery-raised seedlings. Over the last years, several field experiments
   have been conducted in worldwide to enhance the success of the technique
   and to test its feasibility at different sites, sowing conditions, and
   species composition. Based on the analysis of data sets from 53 field
   experiments conducted in Brazil, we (1) assessed the technical and
   ecological feasibility of direct seeding systems for ecological
   restoration using tree species, (2) synthesized the main advances and
   challenges already reported, and (3) provided future guidelines for
   restoration scientists and practitioners. Our study indicates that
   direct seeding is mostly conducted in the two Brazilian hotspots
   (Atlantic Forest and Cerrado), on abandoned pastures, and using a high
   number of seeds per hectare. Establishment and growth rates are very low
   for most sites, but survival rates are usually high. To achieve
   satisfactory tree seedling density and ground coverage, and to eliminate
   exotic species that constrain natural regeneration and succession, it is
   necessary to use a high number of viable seeds. Currently, seed stocks
   are not promptly available to support direct seeding techniques
   applicability on larger scales. Although direct seeding can be
   considered a cost-effective system for forest restoration, this
   technique still needs to be improved before its recommendation on large
   scale, especially to enhance seedling emergence, establishment, and
   early growth of tree species, and reduce associated risks.},

   after isolation represented about 10\% of the post-isolation sample. The
   species recorded only after isolation were forest species usually found
   above the levels of nets;fragments were not colonized by nonforest
   species. Use of fragments did not differ between 1- and 10-ha fragments.
   The landscape surrounding the fragments included active cattle pasture,
   abandoned pasture, and Cecropia-dominated second growth, but this
   variation had little effect on use of fragments by hummingbirds. The
   results suggest that these understory hummingbirds can persist in a
   matric of fragments, secondary growth, and large forest patches. This
   response is much different than that of the insectivorous birds that
   dominate the understory bird community at the site, which are much more
   vulnerable to fragmentation.},

Abstract = {The recovery of soil conditions is crucial for successful ecosystem
   restoration and, hence, for achieving the goals of the UN Decade on
   Ecosystem Restoration. Here, we assess how soils resist forest
   conversion and agricultural land use, and how soils recover during
   subsequent tropical forest succession on abandoned agricultural fields.
   Our overarching question is how soil resistance and recovery depend on
   local conditions such as climate, soil type and land-use history. For
   300 plots in 21 sites across the Neotropics, we used a chronosequence
   approach in which we sampled soils from two depths in old-growth
   forests, agricultural fields (i.e. crop fields and pastures), and
   secondary forests that differ in age (1-95 years) since abandonment. We
   measured six soil properties using a standardized sampling design and
   laboratory analyses. Soil resistance strongly depended on local
   conditions. Croplands and sites on high-activity clay (i.e. high
   fertility) show strong increases in bulk density and decreases in pH,
   carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) during deforestation and subsequent
   agricultural use. Resistance is lower in such sites probably because of
   a sharp decline in fine root biomass in croplands in the upper soil
   layers, and a decline in litter input from formerly productive
   old-growth forest (on high-activity clays). Soil recovery also strongly
   depended on local conditions. During forest succession, high-activity
   clays and croplands decreased most strongly in bulk density and
   increased in C and N, possibly because of strongly compacted soils with
   low C and N after cropland abandonment, and because of rapid vegetation
   recovery in high-activity clays leading to greater fine root growth and
   litter input. Furthermore, sites at low precipitation decreased in pH,
   whereas sites at high precipitation increased in N and decreased in C :
   N ratio. Extractable phosphorus (P) did not recover during succession,
   suggesting increased P limitation as forests age. These results indicate
   that no single solution exists for effective soil restoration and that
   local site conditions should determine the restoration strategies.This
   article is part of the theme issue `Understanding forest landscape
   restoration: reinforcing scientific foundations for the UN Decade on
   Ecosystem Restoration'.},

Abstract = {Growth of secondary forest (capoeira) is an important factor in
   absorption of carbon from the atmosphere. Estimates of this absorption
   vary greatly, in large part due to the effect of different land-use
   histories on the estimates available in the literature. We relate
   land-use history to aboveground biomass accumulation of secondary
   vegetation in plots on land that had been used for agriculture
   (unmechanized manioc and maize) and for pasture in small rural
   properties in the Taruma-Mirim settlement near Manaus in central
   Amazonia, Brazil. We evaluated influence of (a) age of the second growth
   vegetation, (b) time of use as agriculture or pasture and (c) number of
   times the area was burned. Biomass data were obtained by destructive
   sampling of all plants with diameter at breast height >1 cm in 24
   parcels of secondary vegetation ranging from 1 to 15 years of age in
   abandoned pasture (n = 9) and agriculture (n = 15). As compared to
   secondary vegetation in abandoned agricultural fields, vegetation in
   abandoned cattle pasture (the predominant use history for Amazonian
   secondary vegetation) grows 38\% more slowly to age 6 years. Number of
   burns also negatively affects biomass recovery. Applying the growth
   rates we measured to the secondary forests reported in Brazil's Second
   National Communication to the United Nations Framework Convention on
   Climate Change suggests that carbon uptake by this vegetation is
   overestimated by a factor of four in the report. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Title = {A General Rule-Based Framework for Generating Alternatives for Forest
   Ecosystem Management Decision Support Systems},
Journal = {FORESTS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {14},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Linear programming formulations of forest ecosystem management (FEM)
   problems proposed in the 1960s have been adapted and improved upon over
   the years. Generating management alternatives for forest planning is a
   key step in building these models. Global forests are diverse, and a
   variety of models have been developed to simulate management
   alternatives. This paper describes iGen, a forest prescription generator
   that employs a rule-based system (AI-RBS), an AI technique that is often
   used for expert systems. iGen was designed with the goal of being able
   to generate management alternatives for virtually any FEM problem. The
   prescription generator is not designed for, adapted to, focused on-and
   ideally not limited to-any specific region, landscape, forest condition,
   projection method, or yield function. Instead, it aims to maximize
   generality, enabling it to address a broad range of FEM problems. The
   goal is that practitioners and researchers who do not have and do not
   want to develop their own alternative generator can use iGen as a
   prescription generator for their problem instances. For those who choose
   to develop their own alternative generators, we hope that the concepts
   and algorithms we propose in this paper will be useful in designing
   their own systems. iGen's flexibility can be attributed to three key
   features. First, users can define the state variable vector for
   management units according to the available data, models (production
   functions), and objectives of their problem instance. Second, users also
   define the types of interventions that can be applied to each type of
   management unit and create a rule base describing the conditions under
   which each intervention can be applied. Finally, users specify the
   equations of motion that determine how the state vector for each
   management unit will be updated over time, depending on which, if any,
   interventions are applied. Other than this basic structure, virtually
   everything in an iGen problem instance is user-defined. iGen uses these
   key elements to simulate all possible management prescriptions for each
   management unit and stores the resulting information in a database that
   is structured to efficiently store the output data from these
   simulations and to facilitate the generation of optimization models for
   ultimately determining the Pareto frontier for a given FEM problem. This
   article introduces iGen, illustrating its concepts, structure, and
   algorithms through two FEM example problems with contrasting forest
   management practices: natural regeneration with shelterwood harvests and
   plantation/coppice. For data and iGen source programs, visit

   growth habits were determined: a tall herb, Mesosphaerum suaveolens
   (tall), Stachytarpheta sanguinea (short), and Jacquemontia evolvuloides
   (climbing). Fully expanded leaves were collected from three sites in
   each of three different natural regeneration periods in a seasonally dry
   tropical forest. Leaf, specific leaf area, epidermis, cuticle,
   parenchyma, and mesophyll thicknesses; stomatal and trichome densities
   were measured. All three species have stomata and trichomes on both leaf
   surfaces and higher densities on the abaxial surface than the adaxial
   surface. M. suaveolens and S. sanguinea have unusual leaf morphological
   and anatomical adjustments, with a larger leaf area in the more open and
   youngest site, but thicker abaxial and adaxial epidermis and mesophyll
   in the oldest site which has the closest canopy stratum. J. evolvuloides
   has more usual adjustments, with a smaller specific leaf area and
   thinner epidermis and isobilateral parenchyma in the youngest site,
   being better acclimatized to low water availability and high light
   incidence. Therefore, M. suaveolens and S. sanguinea have unique
   acclimatization strategies for different environmental conditions.},

Title = {Development of forest structure and leaf area in secondary forests
   regenerating on abandoned pastures in Central Amazonia},
Journal = {EARTH INTERACTIONS},
Year = {2005},
Volume = {9},
Abstract = {The area of secondary forest (SF) regenerating from pastures is
   increasing in the Amazon basin; however, the return of forest and canopy
   structure following abandonment is not well understood. This study
   examined the development of leaf area index (LAI), canopy cover,
   aboveground biomass, stem density, diameter at breast height (DBH), and
   basal area ( BA) by growth form and diameter class for 10 SFs
   regenerating from abandoned pastures. Biomass accrual was tree
   dominated, constituting >= 94\% of the total measured biomass in all
   forests abandoned >= 4 to 6 yr. Vine biomass increased with forest age,
   but its relative contribution to total biomass decreased with time. The
   forests were dominated by the tree Vismia spp. (> 50\%). Tree stem
   density peaked after 6 to 8 yr ( 10 320 stems per hectare) before
   declining by 42\% in the 12- to 14-yr-old SFs. Small-diameter tree stems
   in the 1-5-cm size class composed > 58\% of the total stems for all
   forests. After 12 to 14 yr, there was no significant leaf area below
   150-cm height. Leaf area return (LAI = 3.2 after 12 to 14 yr) relative
   to biomass was slower than literature-reported recovery following
   slash-and-burn, where LAI can reach primary forest levels ( LAI = 4 - 6)
   in 5 yr. After 12 to 14 yr, the colonizing vegetation returned some
   components of forest structure to values reported for primary forest.
   Basal area and LAI were 50\% - 60\%, canopy cover and stem density were
   nearly 100\%, and the rapid tree-dominated biomass accrual was 25\% -
   50\% of values reported for primary forest. Biomass accumulation may
   reach an asymptote earlier than expected because of even-aged,
   monospecific, untiered stand structure. The very slow leaf area
   accumulation relative to biomass and to reported values for recovery
   following slash-and-burn indicates a different canopy development
   pathway that warrants further investigation of causes ( e. g., nutrient
   limitations, competition) and effects on processes such as
   evapotranspiration and soil water uptake, which would influence
   long-term recovery rates and have regional implications.},

Abstract = {Non-native tree plantations represent 7\% of the world's forests and
   1.24\% of the Brazilian vegetation. Planted areas are expected to
   increase in the near future; thus, it is important to systematize
   existing knowledge on the ecological effects of plantations to aid
   forest management and biodiversity conservation. Here, we conducted a
   systematic review of the ecological literature associated with planted
   Pinus and Eucalyptus species in Brazil. We compared publication metrics
   with geographical distribution of species, ecosystems, biomes, studied
   taxa, and ecological impacts. We found 152 publications from 1992 to
   2012. Number of publications positively correlated with area planted,
   number of plantations with forest certification, number of researchers,
   and richness of studied kingdoms. Most studies were in terrestrial
   ecosystems (92.1\%), the Atlantic Forest biome (55.3\%), and the kingdom
   Animalia (68.2\%). Most impacts of non-native tree plantations were
   negative (55.9\%), followed by positive (27\%), and mixed (17.1\%).
   Negative impacts were declines in species richness and abundance, seed
   bank diversity, and natural regeneration. Positive impacts were increase
   or mainteinance of seed bank diversity and natural regeneration. Mixed
   impacts were increases in abundance of native tree plantation pests.
   Taken together, results suggest forest management can help maintain
   biodiversity if it considers previous environmental conditions and
   integrates plantations with surrounding habitats.},

Abstract = {The objective of this work was to evaluate the forest restoration of the
   basin of Guapiacu river in Cachoeiras de Macacu, Rio de Janeiro state,
   using the families of Termites as tools for environmental assessment. We
   analyzed the population fluctuation and feeding guilds of the families
   of Termites: Kalotermitidae, Rhinotermitidae and Termitidae. Six
   sampling points were arranged along Guapiacu river, five points being
   inferred in reforestation carried out in the basin and a point in a
   regeneration control area. Quantitative and qualitative surveys followed
   standard protocols and the samples were obtained directly, without
   baits. Thirty species within 25 genera were identified and the family
   Termitidae was the most frequent. The termite fauna of the control point
   P06 was the richest. From the frequencies of occurrence of the species
   related to their trophic guild, an ecological evaluation table of the
   environments was proposed. The P05 area, rich in plant species,
   presented the greatest similarity to the natural regeneration area P06.
   The majority of the species was classified as xilophagous.},

Abstract = {Background: Forest succession in tropical pastures usually starts from
   woody vegetation patches. Patches may arise within the grass matrix at
   microsites with favourable soil conditions or through facilitation by
   established nurse plants.Aims: We report the formation of woody
   vegetation patches in tropical pastures after investigating whether
   patch formation was associated with micro-scale terrain features and
   whether facilitation was important for patch initiation.Methods: The
   study was conducted in three pasture sites in the Atlantic forest domain
   of Brazil. We compared soil, terrain and species abundance patterns
   among pairs of woody patch and open pasture plots.Results: The effect of
   variation in soil physical and chemical attributes was limited. Some
   species were able to establish in the grass matrix and survive
   disturbance from grazing and fire, while other species only established
   in patches, under other already established trees or shrubs. Some of
   these species were exotics, which are commonly eliminated in restoration
   efforts.Conclusions: Allowing the establishment of species capable of
   withstanding pasture environments, including exotics, can accelerate
   succession. Furthermore, the abilities to endure competition from
   grasses and survive fire are key features of species suitable for the
   initial stages of forest restoration in tropical pastures.},

Abstract = {Alchornea castaneifolia (Willd) A. Juss. (Urana) is a native species
   with potential for restoration of riparian vegetation and urban
   forestry. Given the difficulty of its propagation and the lack of
   knowledge about their behavior in nursery, this study aimed to evaluate
   the transposition of Alchornea castaneifolia from natural regeneration
   as a strategy for saplings production in nursery. The collecting took
   place in Porto Acre - AC, and selected 120 seedlings, which were divided
   into three height classes (<10 cm, 10-15 cm, >15 cm) and cultivated in
   four substrates (soil, sand, wasting acai+soil, Plantmax) in a
   completely randomized design in a 3x4 factorial design. We investigated
   the survival of seedlings and the growth in sand substrate to the
   characteristics height (H) and collar diameter (DC), the relationship
   H/DC, dry mass of shoots, roots and total between the three height
   classes of the seedlings. The highest percentage of Alchornea
   castaneifolia seedlings survival was observed in the sand substrate
   (67\%), followed by the wasting acai+soil substrate (43\%). Seedlings
   that showed greater growth in height, collar diameter and dry mass
   production were contained in the class above 15 cm in sand substrate.
   However, the 10-15 cm class of height presented 100\% survival of
   seedlings in sand substrate and also provided high growth. It is
   therefore recommended the transposition of seedling in the 10-15 cm
   class using sand substrate for the propagation of Alchornea
   castaneifolia in nursery.},

Title = {Land use and social-ecological legacies of Rio de Janeiro's Atlantic
   urban forests: from charcoal production to novel ecosystems},
Journal = {ROYAL SOCIETY OPEN SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {8},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN 30},
Abstract = {Historical ecology is an important tool in deciphering human-environment
   interactions imprinted on landscapes throughout time. However, gaps of
   knowledge still remain regarding the land use legacies hidden in the
   current Atlantic Forest landscape; and also regarding how this
   information can help management of the remaining forest cover. The
   social-ecological systems framework was applied to understand charcoal
   production in the urban forests of Rio de Janeiro, from the nineteenth
   to mid-twentieth century, and their current social-ecological legacies.
   Charcoal production carried out by former enslaved populations, allowed
   for rapid forest regeneration. Forest thinning instead of forest felling
   was carried out by small groups in these urban remnant forests, sparing
   large native trees and facilitating natural regeneration. Currently,
   more than one thousand former charcoal production sites are accounted
   for hidden underneath the forest cover. The forest landscape of today is
   a result of novel forest successional trajectories that recovered
   structural and functional attributes of the forest ecosystem. However,
   this came at the cost of social invisibility and marginalization of
   these populations. The management practices of charcoal production
   dispersed in the landscape is one of Rio de Janeiro's most important,
   albeit hidden, land use legacies. Currently, the forested landscape is
   comprised of regenerated forests, both structurally and functionally
   sound, though with significant changes in species composition including
   the introduction of exotic species throughout recent centuries. These
   urban forests are today a complex mosaic of novel ecosystems, with rich
   biocultural diversity, and together with managed lands and well
   conserved forest tracts, provide not only livelihood and sustenance for
   forest dwelling families, but also important ecosystem services for the
   entire population of Rio de Janeiro. We believe that these concepts and
   frameworks can offer practical solutions for urban forest management,
   taking into account the biocultural diversity of Rio de Janeiro,
   increasing awareness of sustainability and promoting food security.},

Abstract = {We examined the ecological impact of traditional land use by Wayana
   Amerindians in French Guiana using ants as bio-indicators. Ants were
   sampled through a rapid assessment method and the core results analyzed

   (1) a Wayana village; (2) a cassava plantation; (3) an abandoned cassava
   plantation; (4) a forest fragment near the village; (5) a riparian
   forest; and (6) a primary terra firma forest. The ant diversity
   decreases according to the decree to which the habitat is disturbed. The
   SOM allowed us to compare the ecological succession between the six
   habitats. The protocol used is robust since the same conclusions were

Abstract = {With the intensification of global warming, the occurrence of
   large-scale natural events is becoming even more common in tropical
   regions, which can impact the structure of plant communities. In this
   study, we evaluated the isolated and combined effects of an
   extratropical cyclone and the dominance of a native bamboo species
   (Merostachys skvortzovii) on floristic composition, diversity,
   demographic rates and the increment of trees in Atlantic Forest
   fragments in Southern Brazil. In 2014 (T1) and 2016 (T2), we sampled 56
   plots of 200 m(2) for the effects of an extratropical cyclone in 2009
   (T0). We also evaluated another 60 plots of the same size not in the
   direct path of this cyclone. Half of the plots in each group were
   covered by dense groupings of bamboos, as a result of past human
   activities, which could potentially limit natural regeneration. We
   observed an increase in richness and diversity indices (H ` and 1/D)
   from the first (T0) to the following assessments (T1 an T2) on the sites
   affected by the cyclone, when compared to non-affected sites. After the
   cyclone, both density and basal area they decreased, but there was an
   increase in recruitment, mortality, turnover rates and basal area, as
   well as basal increment. The diameter increment on surviving individuals
   was higher in cyclone-affected sites than in non-affected sites. Bamboo
   cover did not affect richness or demographic rates (except mortality
   between T0 and T1). Natural impacts of this nature can lead to
   significant alterations of demographic rates, allowing the input of new
   species and influencing the pace of demographic processes.},

Abstract = {Aim Evaluate how large-scale forest regeneration based on a low-cost

   fragmentation associated to future climate changes on the distribution
   of birds and arboreal mammals in a tropical biodiversity hotspot; find
   areas with different current and future potential species richness and
   assess how passive restoration can reduce the risk of species
   extinction. Location Brazilian Atlantic Forest (BAF). Methods We built a
   forest regeneration scenario via a model of seed dispersal based on the
   potential movement of frugivorous fauna and projected the potential
   distribution of 356 bird species and 21 arboreal mammals based on
   Species Distribution Models (SDM) which employed 79,462 occurrence
   records and four algorithms for different climate and landscape
   scenarios. SDM were based on climate and landscape predictors separately
   and the results were combined into maps of species richness. Finally, we
   assessed the species' risk of extinction based on the species-area
   relationship. Results Without considering the effects of climate change,
   the potential distribution area for each species increases on average by
   72.5\% (SD = 8\%) in the scenario of potential regeneration. Climate
   change decreases the area of potential occurrence of 252 species, which
   may suffer a mean reduction of 74.4\% (SD = 9.3\%) in their current
   potential distribution areas. BAF regions with the largest amounts of
   forest had the greatest potential richness of species. In future climate
   scenario, 3.4\% of species may become extinct, but we show that
   large-scale regeneration may prevent these extinctions. Main conclusions
   Despite the possible negative impacts of climate change on the
   distribution of 67\% of the studied species, which would increase the
   risk of species extinction, our analysis indicated that promoting
   large-scale BAF restoration based on natural regeneration may prevent

   regrowth gradient},
Journal = {GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION},
Year = {2018},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Efforts to restore tropical forest ecosystem services depend on
   understanding the barriers to germination of species of economic and
   cultural interest. Here we use two important non-timber forest product
   species (NTFP: Inga capitata. Desv. - Fabaceae and Euterpe oleracea
   Mart. - Arecaeae) to compare germination across a forest regrowth
   gradient in the northeast Brazilian Amazon. Experimental treatments were
   used to examine the effects of mid to large-bodied vertebrates and
   litter cover on seed fate (germination, removal and invertebrate
   infestation) in 15 lowland sites within small-holder properties.
   Regrowth stage was classified into three groups, with five sites each
   of: late second-regrowth forest, early second-regrowth forest and
   abandoned pasture. We conducted a paired split-plot experiment using
   experimental plots composed of a vertebrate exclosure versus an open
   treatment and subplots with and without litter. We used Generalized
   Linear Mixed-Effects Models (GLMMs) to compare additive and interaction
   effects of treatments across regrowth stages compared with 15 paired
   control sites. We found that the effects of regrowth stage and exclosure
   were species specific and these effects differed between responses
   (germination, removal and invertebrate infestation). Clearing litter
   generated a significant effect only for invertebrate infestation, which
   increased in the cleared plots. Our findings show that seed removal
   limits germination success for both species across forest regrowth
   stages, with invertebrate infestation also having important but
   secondary effects. Increased removal and unfavorable abiotic conditions
   make direct seeding unviable in pasture sites. We suggest that direct
   seeding is a viable alternative for the establishment of these widely
   available NTFP species in late and early regrowth forests. (C) 2017 The

Journal = {FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2020},

Month = {MAR 15},
Abstract = {Bamboo dominance in tropical forests drives changes in floristic
   composition and vegetation structure. However, the role of bamboo
   dominance over ecosystem functions - including those related to forest
   regeneration - has received less attention. This study evaluated the
   fine-scale effects of the dominance of native bamboo Guadua weberbaueri
   Pflg. (Poaceae) on seed rain in a terra-firme forest in the southwest of
   the Brazilian Amazon to understand how bamboos remain a dominant element
   where they occur. We tested the hypothesis that bamboo dominance (i)
   reduces seed diversity and biomass and (ii) changes floristic
   composition and frequencies of seed dispersal mechanisms. For one year,
   we sampled seeds from seed rain in adjacent bamboo-dominated (BD) and
   bamboo-free (BF) environments in a forest without major anthropogenic
   disturbances. We found lower seed species richness in the BD environment
   and similar seed biomass between BD and BF. In addition, the seed
   species composition differed between BD and BF, with higher frequency of
   abiotic mechanisms to seeds dispersal in BD. We conclude that the
   dominance of bamboos acts as a filter for species that arrive via seed
   rain, modifying the floristic composition and dispersal mechanisms and,
   consequently, the dynamics of natural regeneration processes of
   terra-firme forests in the Amazon. This process can promote the
   permanence and expansion of the distribution area of bamboos in tropical
   forests.},

Abstract = {The soil seed bank is an important ecological component in forest
   regeneration. In semiarid regions, forest regeneration is highly
   affected by seasonal and interannual variations in precipitation,
   because these variations may affect the composition, species richness,
   and density of seeds in the soil. This study aimed to characterize and
   compare these parameters of the germinable seed bank in fragments of
   young and mature Caatinga forest between various seasons and over
   consecutive years. A total of 105 soil samples were collected in 20 x 20
   x 5 cm plots in each forest (Young and Mature) at the end of the rainy
   and dry seasons over 4 years (2009-2012), totaling 840 samples. The
   composition, species richness, and density of seeds were determined by
   the method of seedling emergence. Over the 4 years, 121 species emerged
   from the soil seed bank, 86 in the young forest, and 109 in the mature
   forest. Significant differences in the composition, richness, and
   density were recorded between forests, seasons, and years, with a
   significant interaction between them. Relationship between rainfall and
   age of forests affects the dynamics of the soil seed bank in semiarid
   environments, which are important distinctions for the maintenance of
   these areas. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {In some tropical regions, following the abandonment of agriculture and
   pastures, secondary forests can recover plant species richness and
   forest structure (e.g. canopy cover, biomass); however, the importance
   of these secondary forests for fauna is not clear. Secondary forests can
   benefit fauna by providing suitable habitats, connecting forests
   fragments, and increasing gene flow. Previous studies of forest
   regeneration have showed different levels of amphibian recovery. In
   Puerto Rico, 1-5 years old secondary forests achieved similar amphibian
   species richness and composition in comparison with old-growth forests,
   while in Brazil secondary forests from 14 to 19 years of recovery only
   recovered 60\% of the species of old-growth forests. We evaluated
   amphibian recovery in secondary forests in northeastern Costa Rica, by
   assessing amphibian recovery in 12 secondary forests that vary in age of
   recovery and in three old-growth forests using visual and acoustic
   surveys. Our sites varied in terms of their landscape (e.g. amount of
   surrounding forest) and forest characteristics (e.g. forest age,
   aboveground biomass, basal area, number of tree species, number of
   stems, leaf-litter depth), but there was no relationship between these
   characteristics and amphibian species richness or species composition.
   We found that amphibians are recovering rapidly in secondary forests in
   Costa Rica, and even young forests (10-16 years) had similar species
   richness and composition in comparison with old-growth forests. These
   forests are providing suitable microhabitats conditions for amphibians.
   In addition, this study highlights the importance of landscape
   characteristics. The abundance of amphibian species sources (e.g. forest
   patches) and connections between forests appear to be helping the
   species colonize these sites. Worldwide, the area of secondary forests
   is increasing, and our results show that these habitats are suitable for
   a diversity of amphibian species, suggesting that these forests can help
   reduce amphibian population and species decline. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {Selective logging is well-recognized as an effective practice in
   sustainable forest management. However, the ecological efficiency or
   resilience of the residual stand is often in doubt. Recovery time
   depends on operational variables, diversity, and forest structure.
   Selective logging is excellent but is open to changes. This may be
   resolved by mathematical programming and this study integrates the
   economic-ecological aspects in multi-objective function by applying two
   evolutionary algorithms. The function maximizes remaining stand
   diversity, merchantable logs, and the inverse of distance between trees
   for harvesting and log landings points. The Brazilian rainforest
   database (566 trees) was used to simulate our 216-ha model. The log
   landing design has a maximum volume limit of 500 m(3). The nondominated
   sorting genetic algorithm was applied to solve the main optimization
   problem. In parallel, a sub-problem (p-facility allocation) was solved
   for landing allocation by a genetic algorithm. Pareto frontier analysis
   was applied to distinguish the gradients alpha-economic,
   beta-ecological, and gamma-equilibrium. As expected, the solutions have
   high diameter changes in the residual stand (average removal of
   approximately 16 m(3) ha(-1)). All solutions showed a grouping of trees
   selected for harvesting, although there was no formation of large
   clearings (percentage of canopy removal < 7\%, with an average of 2.5
   ind ha(-1)). There were no differences in floristic composition by
   preferentially selecting species with greater frequency in the initial
   stand for harvesting. This implies a lower impact on the demographic
   rates of the remaining stand. The methodology should support projects of
   reduced impact logging by using spatial-diversity information to guide
   better practices in tropical forests.},

Abstract = {Mauritia flexuosa L.f. (swamp forest palm) stands are widely distributed

   rates of seedlings from June 2010 to November 2012 on a 1-ha plot in a
   flooded forest area of Colombian Amazonia. The recorded mortality and
   recruitment rates of M. flexuosa were higher compared to its survival

Abstract = {This study aimed to evaluate the soil seed bank and accumulated litter

   (0.30 x 0.30 x 0.05 m) to evaluate the seed bank by germination method
   and a sample of 1.0 m(2) litter for evaluation of accumulated litter. We
   performed the classification of individuals and species of seedlings of
   the seed bank as for successional category, dispersion syndrome and life
   form. 5,555 seedlings were recorded, belonging to 32 families and 93
   species and morphotype which grouped all the vines. We recorded the
   predominance of zoochoric dispersion syndrome and, as for life form, a
   higher percentage of herbs, at the species level (48.6\%) and
   individuals (44.8\%). Among the shrub-arboreal species, we observed a
   higher percentage of successional category pioneer, species level
   (75.1\%) and individuals (85.1\%). The accumulated litter average was of
   3,432 kg ha(-1), with the leaf fraction representing 65\% and
   significant correlation with basal area (p = 0.031, R-2 = 0.29) of the

   restored after 40 years of its implementation is similar, as for
   ecological relations, to the areas of stational semidecidual forest in

Title = {Modeling spatial decisions with graph theory: logging roads and forest
   fragmentation in the Brazilian Amazon},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {23},
Number = {1},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {This article addresses the spatial decision-making of loggers and
   implications for forest fragmentation in the Amazon basin. It provides a
   behavioral explanation for fragmentation by modeling how loggers build
   road networks, typically abandoned upon removal of hardwoods. Logging
   road networks provide access to land, and the settlers who take
   advantage of them clear fields and pastures that accentuate their
   spatial signatures. In shaping agricultural activities, these networks
   organize emergent patterns of forest fragmentation, even though the
   loggers move elsewhere. The goal of the article is to explicate how
   loggers shape their road networks, in order to theoretically explain an
   important type of forest fragmentation found in the Amazon basin,
   particularly in Brazil. This is accomplished by adapting graph theory to
   represent the spatial decision-making of loggers, and by implementing
   computational algorithms that build graphs interpretable as logging road
   networks. The economic behavior of loggers is conceptualized as a profit
   maximization problem, and translated into spatial decision-making by
   establishing a formal correspondence between mathematical graphs and
   road networks. New computational approaches, adapted from operations
   research, are used to construct graphs and simulate spatial
   decision-making as a function of discount rates, land tenure, and
   topographic constraints. The algorithms employed bracket a range of
   behavioral settings appropriate for areas of terras devolutas, public
   lands that have not been set aside for environmental protection,
   indigenous peoples, or colonization. The simulation target sites are
   located in or near so-called Terra do Meio, once a major logging
   frontier in the lower Amazon Basin. Simulation networks are compared to
   empirical ones identified by remote sensing and then used to draw
   inferences about factors influencing the spatial behavior of loggers.
   Results overall suggest that Amazonia's logging road networks induce
   more fragmentation than necessary to access fixed quantities of wood.
   The paper concludes by considering implications of the approach and
   findings for Brazil's move to a system of concession logging.},

Title = {Sensitivity of Optical Satellites to Estimate Windthrow Tree-Mortality
   in a Central Amazon Forest},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {15},
Number = {16},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Windthrow (i.e., trees broken and uprooted by wind) is a major natural
   disturbance in Amazon forests. Images from medium-resolution optical
   satellites combined with extensive field data have allowed researchers
   to assess patterns of windthrow tree-mortality and to monitor forest
   recovery over decades of succession in different regions. Although
   satellites with high spatial-resolution have become available in the
   last decade, they have not yet been employed for the quantification of
   windthrow tree-mortality. Here, we address how increasing the spatial
   resolution of satellites affects plot-to-landscape estimates of
   windthrow tree-mortality. We combined forest inventory data with Landsat
   8 (30 m pixel), Sentinel 2 (10 m), and WorldView 2 (2 m) imagery over an
   old-growth forest in the Central Amazon that was disturbed by a single
   windthrow event in November 2015. Remote sensing estimates of windthrow
   tree-mortality were produced from Spectral Mixture Analysis and
   evaluated with forest inventory data (i.e., ground true) by using
   Generalized Linear Models. Field measured windthrow tree-mortality (3
   transects and 30 subplots) crossing the entire disturbance gradient was
   26.9 +/- 11.1\% (mean +/- 95\% CI). Although the three satellites
   produced reliable and statistically similar estimates (from 26.5\% to
   30.3\%, p < 0.001), Landsat 8 had the most accurate results and
   efficiently captured field-observed variations in windthrow
   tree-mortality across the entire gradient of disturbance (Sentinel 2 and
   WorldView 2 produced the second and third best results, respectively).
   As expected, mean-associated uncertainties decreased systematically with
   increasing spatial resolution (i.e., from Landsat 8 to Sentinel 2 and
   WorldView 2). However, the overall quality of model fits showed the
   opposite pattern. We suggest that this reflects the influence of a
   relatively minor disturbance, such as defoliation and crown damage, and
   the fast growth of natural regeneration, which were not measured in the
   field nor can be captured by coarser resolution imagery. Our results
   validate the reliability of Landsat imagery for assessing
   plot-to-landscape patterns of windthrow tree-mortality in dense and
   heterogeneous tropical forests. Satellites with high spatial resolution
   can improve estimates of windthrow severity by allowing the
   quantification of crown damage and mortality of lower canopy and
   understory trees. However, this requires the validation of remote
   sensing metrics using field data at compatible scales.},

Abstract = {Mangrove restoration is a powerful tool for reconstructing degraded
   tropical estuaries worldwide. The level of intervention necessary for
   rebuilding a mangrove area is still under study because this system is
   quite dynamic and some degraded areas are able to recover by themselves.
   We compared a Restored Area planted with Rhizophora mangle and a
   Self-recovered Area, to investigate how they would differ in respect to
   their plant and crab assemblages. In each area, 10 plots were randomly
   sampled for measuring tree richness, density, diameter at breast height
   and biomass, as well as crab richness and density after five years from
   recover. Plant height and biomass, as well as crab density, were
   significantly higher in the Restored in relation to the Self-recovered
   Area. However, tree richness was higher in the Self-recovered Area and
   crab assemblage reached in five years a similar composition in assisted,
   naturally recovered and natural areas, showing the high resilience of
   this important functional group. Active planting of R. mangle propagules
   can significantly improve mangrove recovery in sites with high propagule
   predation, increasing tree biomass and accelerating the return of animal
   functional groups such as crabs. However, if resources for active
   restoration are scarce, passive recovery can be a successful low cost
   alternative for mangrove restoration that preserves tree diversity and
   crab assemblages. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Understorey wildfires harm tropical forests by affecting natural
   regeneration, but the trajectories of fire-disturbed forests after
   disturbance are poorly understood. To fill this gap, we conducted
   experimental burns in a transitional forest between the Amazon forests
   and the Brazilian Savanna (Cerrado) and investigated their effects on
   plant community diversity of regeneration. The experiment consisted of
   three 50-ha plots that between 2004 and 2010 were burned either annually
   (six times), every three years (thrice) or not at all (Control). To
   evaluate early post-fire recovery, we recorded grass occurrence and
   regenerating stems (<= 1 cm in diameter at breast height). We noted that
   high fire-frequency plots had a reduction of species richness (62\%) and
   abundance (84\%) and were associated with floristic and structural
   changes, dominance of few species and increase of grass colonization
   when compared with low fire-frequency. We observed that resprouts were
   the main pathway for forest restoration in both burned regimes,
   particularly in low fire-frequency. However, the forest can recover from
   fires by means of resprouting, until a threshold in fire frequency is
   reached, when resprouts and seedlings declined for most of the species,
   with a few fire-tolerant species becoming dominant.},

Title = {A comprehensive experimental assessment of glyphosate ecological impacts
   in riparian forest restoration},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {32},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Competition with invasive grasses is one of the most important drivers
   of tree planting failures, especially in tropical forests. A widely
   disseminated weeding approach has been glyphosate spraying, the most
   used herbicide globally in forestry and ecosystem restoration. However,
   glyphosate use in restoration is highly controversial and requires
   further studies to elucidate its effects on restoration processes and
   the environment. We evaluated the use of glyphosate in riparian forest
   restoration and its impacts on tree planting costs, weed control
   efficiency, planted seedling performance, herbaceous and woody species
   regeneration, soil bacteria, and environmental contamination, using
   mowing treatments as a reference and based on a controlled experiment
   established in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. Glyphosate spraying
   reduced by one-half and one-third the accumulated aboveground biomass
   of, respectively, weeds in general and of the invasive grass Urochloa
   decumbens compared to mowing treatments, and it reduced the cost by
   half. The performance of planted tree seedlings was markedly favored by
   glyphosate spraying compared to mowing treatments, as expressed by
   improved seedling height (similar to twice higher), crown area (similar
   to 5x higher), and basal area (similar to 5x higher); the regeneration
   of both native woody and ruderal herbaceous plants were also enhanced.
   Neither glyphosate nor its metabolite Aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA)
   residues were detected in either water runoff or soil samples, but they
   were found at relatively high concentrations in the runoff sediments
   (from 1.32 to 24.75 mg/kg for glyphosate and from 1.75 to 76.13 mg/kg
   for AMPA). Soil bacteria communities differed before and after
   glyphosate spraying in comparison to mowing plots (without glyphosate).
   Glyphosate spraying was far more cost effective than mowing for
   controlling U. decumbens and greatly improved the performance of planted
   tree seedlings and natural regeneration, while not leaving residues in
   soil and water. However, the changes in the structure of bacterial
   communities and high concentration of glyphosate and AMPA residues in
   runoff sediments highlight the need for caution when using this
   herbicide in riparian buffers. We present alternatives for reducing
   glyphosate use and minimizing its risks in tree planting initiatives.},

Title = {Policies to encourage agroforestry in the Southern Atlantic Forest},
Journal = {LAND USE POLICY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {112},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Agroforestry is recognized as a friendly land-management practice
   because it can contribute to improve soil productivity, biodiversity
   conservation, ecosystem functions, climate change mitigation, landscape
   connectivity and the delivery of ecosystem services, optimizing
   livelihood benefits for people. The Atlantic Forest, a worldwide
   biodiversity hotspot, which presents large areas in natural regeneration
   and a promising scenario for ecological restoration has great potential
   for agroforestry. According to Brazilian legislation, the agroforestry
   conducted on remnants of Atlantic Forest depends on previous
   environmental authorization regarding both the vegetation management and
   the commercialization of native flora products. Although Brazilian
   legislation provides incentives for agroforestry, there are important
   barriers to its development regarding to the vegetation management for
   production, processing (enforcement of health and sanitation laws), and
   trading of timber and non-timber products. In the Rio Grande do Sul, the
   procedures for obtaining environmental authorization concerning the
   management and trading of native plants were too bureaucratic,
   unattractive, and infeasible for small rural landowners because the
   environmental legislation was not translated into effective public
   policies. Since the agroforestry and extraction of native flora products
   needs to comply with legislation and the key point is to guarantee the
   legal and sustainable origin of the products, and the management carried
   out, the appropriate procedure for the regularization of such practices
   is a certification of forest management. The SEMA's agroforestry
   certification (SAC) is a simplified procedure to legal compliance and
   sustainable management of native vegetation and mainly attends family
   farmers, indigenous peoples, maroons, and traditional populations. Until
   September 2019, nearly 130 landowners requested the SAC from 65
   municipalities of Rio Grande do Sul. According to the applicants, around
   99\% of rural properties are considered small, ranging from 1.3 to 156
   ha. Altogether, they add up to almost 380 ha of agroforestry in
   anthropic areas, some of them degraded by intense historical land use.
   The extraction of fruits and seeds and the planting of native tree
   species (59\% and 48\%, respectively) were the most mentioned
   agroforestry management by the applicants. The main products or species
   of interest mentioned were fruits and heart of palm from Euterpe edulis
   (52\%), fruits of Citrus spp. (51\%), native timber (49\%), non-native
   fruits (44\%), native Myrtaceae fruits (39\%), other native fruits
   (32\%), banana crops (29\%), Yerba-mate (26\%), non-native timber
   (16\%), other non-native plants (9\%), ornamental plants (9\%), Butia
   catarinensis fruits (7\%), and Butia odorata fruits (2\%). The SAC has
   brought stakeholders (farmers, technical assistants, and researchers)
   closer to the environmental agency, creating a broad new regional agenda
   on agroforestry, and a myriad of conservation opportunities. The
   strengthening of agroforestry-support policies must be an important
   conservation strategy in the Atlantic Forest. However, to carry out such
   policies, it is necessary to create conditions and incentives beyond the
   legislative scope, translating the legal provisions to procedures and
   actions.},

Journal = {BIOLOGY AND FERTILITY OF SOILS},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {48},

Abstract = {Mature tropical forests are considered to be P limited and to cycle P
   efficiently. Whether P limitations are significant in younger secondary
   tropical forests, however, remains largely unexplored. This study
   evaluated P limitation by observing the P fertilizer response of a
   naturally regenerated 24-year-old forest and its soil. In February 1999,
   six 20 x 20-m plots were established in secondary forest in the
   Brazilian Amazon. After 1 year of pre-treatment tree measurements, 50 kg
   P ha(-1) was applied in January 2000 and again in January 2001. Soil
   sorption of P was relatively low (similar to 100 mu g g(-1)) in the
   surface 0-20 cm while sorption increased to similar to 180 mu g g(-1) at
   20-50 cm and approached similar to 500 mu g g(-1) for the 50- to 200-cm
   layers. Soil P in 0-10 cm, measured as sequentially extractable
   fractions (resin, HCO3-Pi, NaOH-Pi, NaOH-Po, and 1 M HCl), increased
   shortly after fertilization and could account for nearly all the 50 kg P
   ha(-1) added at each date. During the following 6 years, soil P in
   fertilized plots declined in all pools other than resin P, and by June
   2006, concentrations returned to pre-fertilization levels. Despite the
   increase in extractable P with fertilization, increased tree growth was
   not detected from stand age 25 to 31 years. It appears that during
   secondary forest succession at this site, the forest P cycle was
   conservative so as to maintain available P at a sufficient concentration
   to meet forest P demands.},

Title = {Multiple drivers influence tree species diversity and above-ground
   carbon stock in second-growth Atlantic forests: Implications for the
   passive restoration},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {318},
Month = {SEP 15},
Abstract = {Second-growth forests (SGF) are critical components for limiting
   biodiversity loss and climate change mitigation. However, these forests
   were established after anthropic disturbances such as land use for
   planting, and in highly human-modified landscapes. These interventions
   can decrease the ability of biological communities to recover naturally,
   and it is necessary to understand how multiple drivers, from local scale
   to landscape scale influence the diversity and carbon stock of these
   forests in natural regeneration. For this, we used data from 37 SGF
   growing on areas previously used for eucalyptus plantations in the
   Brazilian Atlantic Forest, after the last cut cycle. For each SGF, the
   forest tree species diversity was calculated based on the Hills number,
   and we also calculated the aboveground carbon stock. Then, we evaluated
   the influence of multiple environmental factors on these indexes: soil
   properties, past-management intensity, patch configuration, and
   landscape composition. Little influence of soil properties was found,
   only soil fertility negatively influenced above-ground carbon stock.
   However, pastmanagement intensity negatively influenced tree species
   diversity and carbon stock. The isolation of other forests and tree
   species propagules source distance (>500 ha) also negatively influenced
   the diversity of species. This is probably due to the favoring of tree
   pioneer species in highly human-modified landscapes because they are
   more tolerant of environmental changes, less dependent on animal
   dispersal, and have low carbon stock capacity. Thus, areas with higher
   past-management intensity and more isolated areas are less effective for
   passive restoration and may require intervention to recover tree
   diversity and carbon stock in the Atlantic Forest. The approach, which
   had not yet been applied in the Atlantic Forest, brought similar results
   to that found in other forests, and serves as a theoretical basis for
   choosing priority areas for passive restoration in the biome.},

Journal = {FORESTS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {15},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Here, we examine the effects of wildfires on the soil seed bank of a
   terra firme forest in the eastern Amazon. This seed bank is described
   via community-level attributes across forest stands exposed to wildfires
   once or twice, as well as across unburned, old-growth forest stands. A
   total of 2345 seeds germinated (837.5 seeds/m(2)). Across all three
   forest habitats, the soil seed bank was dominated by a small set of
   light-demanding species, with two to three species accounting for over
   80\% of all seeds. On the other hand, the seed bank of all habitats
   completely lacked seeds from the old-growth flora. Wildfires posed no
   effects relative to seed density and species richness. However, fire (1)
   reduced beta diversity, (2) caused an 8\% increase in herb abundance and
   a 4\% increase in the number of seeds produced by short-lived pioneers,
   and (3) resulted in a slight impact on taxonomic species composition.
   Our results suggest that the soil seed bank, while exhibiting high seed
   densities, is naturally species poor and, thus, relatively resistant to
   the first fire events. This implies that the recovery of fire-degraded
   forests will rely on vertebrate-dispersed seeds coming from any
   remaining well-preserved old-growth forest stands that are present in
   the landscape and are highly vulnerable to fire.},

Abstract = {Planted forests are long-term projects involving a large monetary

   does not allow for the incorporation of these flexibilities, our study
   aimed to analyze whether investment projects in planted forests of Pinus
   elliottii Engelm. are economically feasible, by applying a real options
   analysis. We used empir-ical data from one hectare of a planted forest
   of P. elliottii with a 14-year plan-ning horizon. Managerial
   flexibilities were incorporated in combinations and also separately, as
   options to defer, ex-pand or abandon the investment project. Through
   Monte Carlo simulation, the present value of USD 1.016 was condi-tioned
   to anticipated return values from the second to the fourteenth year,
   with a volatility return of 14.5\%. With real op-tions analysis, the
   value of the combined options was USD 29, which, in terms of traditional
   net present value, showed an expanded net present value of USD 468. The
   real options analysis thus shows that investment projects in planted
   forests of P. elliottii are economically feasible. Giv-en that real
   options analysis is a meth-odology not widely used in the forestry
   sector for economic analysis of invest-ment projects, this study can be
   used to assist forest managers in analysing in-vestment risks and
   decisions, specifically those related to market fluctuations of planted
   forests of Pinus spp., assuming that the real options of deferral,
   expan-sion and abandonment of an investment project are used.},

Abstract = {Land use changes have resulted in large environmental impacts, and in
   agricultural landscapes sometimes only forest fragments remain. Riparian
   forest remnants can positively influence stream water quality, and serve
   as refuges for aquatic species. We evaluated whether the presence of a
   riparian forest remnant influenced the structure and composition of
   macroinvertebrate communities in a rural stream in southeastern Brazil.
   We sampled three reaches upstream (within abandoned sugarcane
   cultivation) and nine downstream the remnant edge, until 600 m inside
   the forested area, using leaf litter bags. The abundances of Elmidae,
   Chironomidae, and total macroinvertebrates increased along the forest
   remnant, whereas the abundance of Baetidae, proportion of Ephemeroptera,
   Plecoptera, and Trichoptera (EPT), rarefied taxonomic richness, and
   diversity decreased. Taxon richness and EPT abundance did not vary along
   the forest remnant. Increases in Chironomidae and total abundance within
   the forest remnant can be related to moderate increases in nutrient
   concentrations, or to the availability of high quality leaf litter
   patches. Forest remnants can influence macroinvertebrate communities,
   although variation both in temperate and tropical studies can be related
   to local agricultural practices and land use at the watershed scale.
   Forest remnants are important in maintaining stream water quality in
   rural landscapes, and deserve attention in watershed management
   projects.},

Abstract = {The characteristics of nitrogen acquisition, transport and assimilation
   were investigated in species of an Atlantic Forest succession over
   calcareous soil in south-eastern Brazil. Differences in behaviour were
   observed within the regeneration guilds. Pioneer species showed high
   leaf nitrogen contents, a high capacity to respond to increased soil
   nitrogen availability, a high capacity for leaf nitrate assimilation and
   were characterized by the transport of nitrate + asparagine. At the
   other end of the succession, late secondary species had low leaf
   nitrogen contents, little capacity to respond to increased soil nitrogen
   availability, low leaf nitrate assimilation and were active in the
   transport of asparagine + arginine. The characteristics of nitrogen
   nutrition in some early secondary species showed similarities to those
   of pioneer species whereas others more closely resembled late secondary
   species. Average leaf delta(15)N values increased along the successional
   gradient. The results indicate that the nitrogen metabolism
   characteristics of species may be an additional ecophysiological tool in
   classifying tropical forest tree species into ecological guilds, and may
   have implications for regeneration programmes in degraded areas.},

Abstract = {The organic matter dynamics in Atlantic forest ecosystems must be
   understood to ensure the efficiency of conservation programs. Chemical
   characteristics of humic substances are important because they reflect
   the soil genesis processes and soil management, and can be used as
   indicator of the organic matter quality. The purpose of this study was
   to test the organic matter quality as a marker of the soil environment
   in areas of native Atlantic forest developed on a distrophyc Gleysol and
   a distrophyc Cambisol and in abandoned plantations of eucalyptus of
   different ages, at the Uniao Biological Reserve, RJ, Brazil. The
   distribution of the humified fractions of the soil organic matter and
   humic acids were evaluated by chemical and spectroscopic methods, in two
   soil layers (0-0.10 and 0.10-0.20 m). Soil fertility of the Biological
   Reserve was very low, representing a limiting factor for the
   humification process. Humic substances represented less than 50\% of the
   oxidized carbon, indicating that most of the organic matter consists of
   non-humic substances. Consequently, forest litterfall plays a central
   role in the plant/microorganism nutrition. The relative distribution of
   the humic fraction was not altered by the plant cover or soil class. The
   chemical nature of the humic acids was similar to fulvic acids. These
   characteristics were expressed by a low carbon content, high H/C and O/C
   ratios and high acidity values which resulted in humified material with
   low chemical evolution. Infrared, spectroscopy indicated the effect of
   the soil class and plant cover on the chemical quality of the humic
   acids. The fluorescence intensity of humified material isolated from the
   Atlantic forest area was high, suggesting higher lability and capacity
   to release electrons for chemical reactions in the soil.},

Title = {Mid-term effects of reduced-impact logging on the regeneration of seven

Abstract = {Reduced-impact logging (RIL) is a set of techniques aimed to maintain
   forest structure and functions of the harvested forest as similar as
   possible to pre-logging status, while reducing adverse impacts from
   logging activity on the remaining forest. We analysed the mid-term
   effects of RIL on the regeneration of the long-lived pioneers (LLP)
   Bagassa guianensis and Jacaranda copaia: the partially shade tolerant
   (PST) Hymenaea courbaril, Dipteryx odorata, and Carapa guianensis and
   the total shade tolerant species (TST) Symphonia globulifera and
   Manilkara huberi. This study was carried out in an intensive study plot
   in the 600,000-ha Tapajos National Forest, Eastern Amazon - Brazil (03
   degrees 02'S and 54 degrees 56'W). Three transects split in 10 x 10 m
   plots, adding up to 2.37 ha were sampled in an area where RIL was
   applied, and compared with a same size sampling in an unlogged area. The
   regeneration of individuals <= 20 cm in dbh was inventoried and measured
   before logging in 2003 and three times after logging (2004, 2006, and
   2009). RIL modified the forest structure creating more gap-phase plots,
   with the consequences of such disturbance still remaining after 6 years.
   Densities of B. guianensis, J. copaia, and S. globulifera increased,
   while C guianensis diminished. The positive effect on the density of LLP
   species was, however, ephemeral and disappeared 2 years after logging.
   RIL had a positive effect on the height growth rate of S. globulifera
   and on the dbh growth rate of C. guianensis. Plants growing in the
   gap-phase plots had higher height growth rates (ANOVA, F-2;2980 = 33.3,
   p < 0.001) than plants growing in other phases, but the same difference
   was not observed for dbh growth rates (ANOVA, F-1;364 = 0.9, p = 0.33).
   Crown position had positive effects on height and dbh growth rates: the
   higher the crown position, the faster the plant grows in height (ANOVA,
   F-3;2979 = 148.4, p < 0.001) and dbh (ANOVA, F-3;362 = 26.1, p < 0.001).
   The application of RIL following the Brazilian regulations, may be
   considered a silvicultural technique for increasing density and growth
   rates of commercial species, but additional silvicultural interventions,
   as liberation for example, might be required for maintaining the
   ecological outcomes of RIL in the long run. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {Accurate estimation of biomass in natural vegetation sites remains a
   challenge. Modeling biomass growth and production in Cerrado areas is
   crucial to understanding the vegetation succession process, especially
   regarding the changes in biomass accumulation over time. Thus, our
   objective was to model the growth and production of woody aboveground
   biomass (living and total) in a cerrado stricto sensu monitored for 27
   years after implementing management systems. As expected, the basal area
   (with a diameter taken at 30 cm from the ground level) is the most
   important predictor variable and showed a higher correlation with the
   biomass stocks and allowed accurate and consistent estimates of these
   accumulated stocks over time. Future estimates of biomass production,
   generated from growth models that estimate production as a function of
   parameters observed at previous ages, indicate that maximum stocks of
   living (25.86 +/- 0.15 Mg ha(-1) {[}mean +/- standard deviation]) and
   total aboveground biomass (26.11 +/- 0.15 Mg ha(-1)) are expected for a
   period between 28 and 30 years after the implementation of the
   management systems, with maximum mean annual increment between 23 and 27
   years. Furthermore, the systems of equations obtained simulated
   reductions up to 30\% of biomass after the occurrence of a forest fire
   at 23 years. Thus, our study can be useful for the decision-making
   process and developing public policies and strategies for managing and
   conserving natural resources in the Cerrado biome.},

Abstract = {Microbiological soil-quality indicators, especially related to C and N
   cycles, and microbial diversity may be useful tools to determine whether
   a particular environment responds to an imposed management or
   reclamation strategy. External influences such as forest clearance and
   soil management affect biological indicators making them useful to point
   out whether the land use strategy is sustainable. Accordingly, the aim
   of this work was to assess the utility of some soil chemical and
   microbiological properties and 16S rDNA diversity in bacteria domain and
   their significance as soil-quality indicators in different land use
   systems in southern Brazil, Parana State. Nine sites with soil
   originated from basalt (Rhodic Ferralsol), previously covered with the
   Atlantic native forest were evaluated: a native forest tract as
   reference; three sites artificially reforested with native species, but
   with understory differently managed; secondary forest naturally
   regenerated from abandoned pasture; artificially reforested with
   eucalyptus; two wheat-cropped sites at differing vegetative stages; one
   site in fallow. Twenty-four chemical and microbiological properties and
   their derivatives were assessed, in addition to molecular diversity of
   bacteria domain based on denaturating gradient gel electrophoresis
   (DGGE) analysis. Amongst all variables, the most dissimilar along the
   sites were total organic C, microbial biomass C and N, and
   ammonification rate. Total organic C was highest in the native forest,
   followed by secondary forest, eucalyptus and the artificially reforested
   sites; the wheat-cropped and fallow sites produced the lowest values.
   This trend was also observed for ammonification rate, which was closely
   correlated to organic C. Microbial biomass C and N were also higher in
   the reforested sites, whereas for microbial N biomass, the eucalyptus
   site resembled to the wheat-cropped and fallow sites. The DGGE analysis
   revealed that the fallow, eucalyptus and wheat-cropped sites had less
   bacterial diversity. All the sites reforested with native species
   grouped with the native forest, while the eucalyptus, fallow and
   wheat-cropped sites formed separate clusters. A similar clustering
   pattern was observed when all chemical and microbiological properties
   were considered in a grouping analysis. The results for reforestation
   employing native species tended to be similar to those of the stable
   native forest, while the use of an exotic species (eucalyptus) tended to
   be similar to those of the cropped sites. In addition, the fallow site
   showed general unfavorable trends in microbiological indicators and less
   bacterial diversity, suggesting that such soil management is not
   sustainable at least in subtropical areas. In this case, would be
   preferable provide the soil with vegetal covering that increase the
   organic C inputs and consequently microbial diversity and activity. (c)

   fragments},
Journal = {ECOGRAPHY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {40},
Number = {1},
Pages = {26-35},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {A great challenge for ecologists is predicting how communities in
   fragmented tropical landscapes will change in the future. Available
   evidence suggests that fragmented tropical tree communities are
   progressing along a trajectory of `retrogressive succession', in which
   the community shifts towards an early or mid-successional state that
   will persist indefinitely. Here, we investigate the potential endpoint
   of retrogressive succession, examining whether it will eventually lead
   to the highly depauperate communities that characterise recently
   abandoned agricultural lands. We tested this hypothesis by using neural
   networks to construct an empirical model of Amazonian
   rainforest-tree-community responses to experimental habitat
   fragmentation. The strongest predictor of tree-community composition in
   the future was its composition in the present, modified by variables
   like the composition of the surrounding habitat matrix and distance to
   forest edge. We extrapolated network predictions over a 100 yr period
   and quantified trajectories of forest communities in multidimensional
   ordination space. We found no evidence that forest communities,
   including those near forest edges, were converging strongly towards a
   composition dominated by just one or two early successional genera.
   Retrogressive succession may well be stronger in fragmented landscapes
   altered by chronic disturbances, such as edge-related fires, selective
   logging, or intense windstorms, but in this experimental landscape in
   which other human disturbances are very limited, it is unlikely that
   forest edge communities will fully revert to the species poor
   assemblages observed in very early successional landscapes.},

Abstract = {The nutrient demands of regrowing tropical forests are partly satisfied
   by nitrogen-fixing legume trees, but our understanding of the abundance
   of those species is biased towards wet tropical regions. Here we show
   how the abundance of Leguminosae is affected by both recovery from
   disturbance and large-scale rainfall gradients through a synthesis of
   forest inventory plots from a network of 42 Neotropical forest
   chronosequences. During the first three decades of natural forest
   regeneration, legume basal area is twice as high in dry compared with
   wet secondary forests. The tremendous ecological success of legumes in
   recently disturbed, water-limited forests is likely to be related to
   both their reduced leaflet size and ability to fix N-2, which together
   enhance legume drought tolerance and water-use efficiency. Earth system
   models should incorporate these large-scale successional and climatic
   patterns of legume dominance to provide more accurate estimates of the
   maximum potential for natural nitrogen fixation across tropical forests.},

Abstract = {Human activities change natural landscapes, and in doing so endanger
   biodiversity and associated ecosystem services. To reduce the net
   impacts of these activities, such as mining, disturbed areas are
   rehabilitated and restored. During this process, monitoring is important
   to ensure that desired trajectories are maintained. In the Carajas
   region of the Brazilian Amazon, exploration for iron ores has
   transformed the original ecosystem; natural forest and a savanna
   formation with lateritic iron duricrust outcrops named canga. Here,
   native vegetation is logged and topsoil removed and deposited in waste
   piles along with mine waste. During rehabilitation, these waste piles
   are hydroseeded with non-native plant species to achieve rapid
   revegetation. Further, seeds of native canga and forest plant species
   are planted to point ecological succession towards natural ecosystems.
   In this study, we investigate diversity and composition of the arthropod
   community along a post-mining rehabilitation and restoration gradient,
   taking seasonality and primer bias into account. We use DNA
   metabarcoding of bulk arthropod samples collected in both the dry and
   rainy seasons from waste-pile benches at various stages of revegetation:
   non-revegetated exposed soils, initial stage with one-to-three-year-old
   stands, intermediate stage with four-to-five-year-old stands, and
   advanced stage with six-to-seven-year-old stands. We use samples from
   undisturbed cangas and forests as reference sites. In addition, we
   vegetation diversity and structure were measured to investigate
   relations between arthropod community and vegetation structure. Our
   results show that, over time, the arthropod community composition of the
   waste piles becomes more similar to the reference forests, but not to
   the reference cangas. Nevertheless, even the communities in the
   advanced-stage waste piles are different from the reference forests, and
   full restoration in these highly diverse ecosystems is not achieved,
   even after 6 to 7 years. Finally, our results show seasonal variation in
   arthropod communities and primer bias.},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The Brazilian Atlantic Forest has undergone adverse land-use change due
   to deforestation for urbanization and agriculture. Numerous restoration
   initiatives have been taken to restore its ecosystem services.
   Deforested areas have been restored through active intervention or
   natural regeneration. Understanding the impact of those different
   reforestation approaches on soil quality should provide important
   scientific and practical conclusions on increasing forest cover in the
   Brazilian Atlantic Forest biome. However, studies evaluating active
   planting versus natural regeneration in terms of soil recovery are
   scarce. We evaluate soil dynamics under those two contrasting strategies
   at an early stage (<10 years). Reforestation was conducted
   simultaneously on degraded lands previously used for cattle grazing and
   compared to an abandoned pasture as a reference system. We examined soil
   physicochemical properties such as: pH, soil organic matter content,
   soil moisture, N, P, K, Ca, Mg, Na, Fe, Mn, Cu, Al, and soil texture. We
   also present the costs of both methods. We found significant differences
   in restored areas regarding pH, Na, Fe, Mn content, and the cost. Soil
   moisture was significantly higher in pasture. Our research can
   contribute to better decision-making about which restoration strategy to
   adopt to maximize restoration success regarding soil quality and
   ecosystem services in the tropics.},

Abstract = {Drone-based remote sensing is a promising new technology that combines
   the benefits of ground-based and satellite-derived forest monitoring by
   collecting fine-scale data over relatively large areas in a
   cost-effective manner. Here, we explore the potential of the GatorEye
   drone-lidar system to monitor tropical forest succession by canopy
   structural attributes including canopy height, spatial heterogeneity,
   gap fraction, leaf area density (LAD) vertical distribution, canopy
   Shannon index (an index of LAD), leaf area index (LAI), and understory
   LAI. We focus on these variables' relationship to aboveground biomass
   (AGB) stocks and species diversity. In the Caribbean lowlands of
   northeastern Costa Rica, we analyze nine tropical forests stands (seven
   second-growth and two old-growth). Stands were relatively homogenous in
   terms of canopy height and spatial heterogeneity, but not in their gap
   fraction. Neither species density nor tree community Shannon diversity
   index was significantly correlated with the canopy Shannon index. Canopy
   height, LAI, and AGB did not show a clear pattern as a function of
   forest age. However, gap fraction and spatial heterogeneity increased
   with forest age, whereas understory LAI decreased with forest age.
   Canopy height was strongly correlated with AGB. The heterogeneous mosaic
   created by successional forest patches across human-managed tropical
   landscapes can now be better characterized. Drone-lidar systems offer
   the opportunity to improve assessment of forest recovery and develop
   general mechanistic carbon sequestration models that can be rapidly
   deployed to specific sites, an essential step for monitoring progress
   within the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration.},

Abstract = {Understanding the flow of diaspores is fundamental for determining plant
   population dynamics in a particular habitat, and a lack of seeds is a
   limiting factor in forest regeneration, especially in isolated forest
   fragments. Bamboo dominance affects forest structure and dynamics by
   suppressing or delaying the recruitment of and colonization by tree
   species as well as by inhibiting the survival and growth of adult trees.
   The goal of the present study was to determine whether dominance of the
   bamboo species Aulonemia aristulata (Doll) McClure in the forest
   understory influences species abundance and composition. We examined the
   seed rain at two noncontiguous sites (1.5 km apart) within an urban
   forest fragment, with and without bamboo dominance (BD+ and BD- areas,
   respectively). Sixty seed traps (0.5 m(2), with a 1-mm mesh) were set in
   the BD+ and BD areas, and the seed rain was sampled from January to
   December 2007. Diaspores were classified according to dispersal
   syndrome, growth form and functional type of the species to which they
   belonged. There were significant differences between the two areas in
   terms of seed density, species diversity and dispersal syndrome. The BD+
   area showed greater seed density and species diversity. In both areas,
   seed distribution was limited primarily by impaired dispersal. Bamboo
   dominance and low tree density resulted in fewer propagules in the seed
   rain. Our results suggest that low availability of seeds in the rain
   does not promote the maintenance of a degraded state, characterized by
   the presence of bamboo.},

Abstract = {Several factors, including the site where the colony was established and
   number of active nests can influence directly or indirectly the breeding
   success of colonial birds. The red-rumped cacique, Cacicus haemorrhous

   different environments. The objective of this study was to evaluate the
   breeding success of red-rumped cacique in relation to three environments
   (lake edge, forest and swamp) in which colonies were established in an
   Atlantic Forest reserve in southeast Brazil. Seven colonies from the
   three environments were monitored during the breeding season of 2001.
   Overall probability of nest survival was 40.5\%. We found that colonies
   established in the swamp presented higher nest survival than the others
   and the ones in the lake edge had lower survival. Nest predation was the
   most important Cause of nest failure, representing 46.5\% of all nest
   losses. Other failure causes were abandonment and fall of nests,
   representing 6.6\% and 6.1\% of the losses, respectively. Red-rumped
   cacique had higher success breeding in colonies located in the swamp.},

Abstract = {The objective of this study was to evaluate and correlate information
   about soil seed bank and canopy (\%Canopy Openness and Leaf area
   index-LAI) in a mined area in restoration process through natural
   regeneration. The study area is located in Zona da Mata of Minas Gerais,
   which presents predominance of Semideciduous Seasonal Forest, and has an
   area of 0.5 ha in process of natural regeneration after six years of
   bauxite exploitation (without any intervention). Along the area, ten
   plots of 45x29cm were allocated and distributed in the best way to
   represent the whole area in restoration process. Seed bank diversity and
   canopy characteristics were evaluated in these plots, the last one using
   a NIKON D40X photographic camera, with fisheye lens of 8mm. As results,
   8280 individuals (tree, shrub, herbs, and vines) were found, totaling 51
   species and 24 botanical families. The Shannon diversity index (H') was
   2.770, and the equability (J) was 0.705, which demonstrate an average
   diversity in this area, with a density of 2114.94 germinated seeds
   m(-2). Through the evaluation of the seed bank, the presence of exotic
   species (23.5\%), the dominance of the pioneer species (68.6\%), as well
   as high dispersal by wind (52.9\%) were verified in the area. According
   to canopy characteristics, a significant variation between different
   points/regions within the study area was found, while patterns of
   existence of certain herbs as a function of canopy openness (lower
   vegetal cover/clearings) were also identified, as well as in response to
   spatial proximity between the allocated plots, confirming the high
   correlation between these two variables and their importance in the

Abstract = {Studies were carried out on the phenological patterns and dispersion of
   a plant community developed naturally, after limestone mining
   operations, in accumulated materials of wastes (spoil banks). The
   objectives were to focus the seasonality of plant reproductive in a
   degraded environment; to analyze the community according to dispersal
   syndrome and to know about plant resources for the animals. Monthly
   observations of flowering and fruiting, patterns of the community were
   done, comparing the herbaceous, shrubs and woody species. Proportion of
   anemochorous and autochorous was higher in the herbaceous and shrubby
   strata. The zoochorous ones, on the contrary were more frequent in the
   woody stratum. This study showed that natural introduction of the
   animals at the unreclaimed area, increased the chances for long time, of
   preserving the plant species since they are pollinated and dispersed
   their seeds.},

Abstract = {Multitemporal satellite images have been used to differentiate, measure
   the areal extent of, and determine transitional probabilities among
   different secondary forest age classes in the tropics. In these studies,
   temporal gaps in the satellite archive are common doe to difficulties
   associated with availability of cloud-free data, costs, temporal
   discontinuities between satellite sensors, etc. In this probability
   study, examples of multitemporal image sequences with data gaps are
   considered in order to illustrate error rates associated with estimating
   the age of secondary tropical forest. Results indicate that on the order
   of 8-32\% of scene pixels may be misclassified with respect to age of
   land cover transitions which occur within the data gap(s) are ignored.
   Using secondary forest regeneration rates from the literature,
   calculations showed that these gap errors caused the above-ground
   biomass to be over-estimated by 8-23\%. the error rates are
   scene-dependent. The results are presented to flag a potentially
   significant source of error. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 1998.},

Abstract = {Tropical secondary forests are important sinks for atmospheric carbon,
   yet C uptake and accumulation rates are highly uncertain, and the
   mechanisms poorly understood. We evaluated the recovery of C stocks in
   four pools (aboveground biomass, litter, roots and topsoil) during dry
   forest regrowth by combining a space for time replacement (that is, a
   chronosequence) with a repeated measurements approach (that is, a
   resampling). We fit nonlinear models to chronosequence data to test
   whether forest age could explain differences in C stocks across sites,
   and to changes in aboveground biomass calculated from resampling over
   two 3-year periods, to test the predictive potential of forest age. We
   combined data from both approaches into structural equation models (SEM)
   to assess forest age and tree community attributes (diversity and
   dominance) as drivers of C stocks and changes in aboveground biomass.
   Forest age explained differences across sites in C stocks for
   aboveground biomass, litter and live roots, but not for the remaining
   pools. Observed C stock changes in aboveground biomass were poorly
   predicted by forest age. SEM revealed that aboveground biomass C was
   consistently and positively related to forest age and to the community
   weighted mean of maximum tree height (H (max) CWM), but not to tree
   diversity. Observed C stock changes were related only to H (max) CWM,
   although not consistently across the two 3-year periods. Our results
   highlight that the chronosequence approach can yield reasonable insights
   into long-term C accumulation trends, but erroneous estimates of C
   change over specific time periods. They also show that, in addition to
   age, dominance by tall statured species, but not tree species diversity,
   plays a significant role in C accumulation.},

Abstract = {Scientific and public attention concerned with natural rubber (Hevea
   brasiliensis) production in the Amazon has focused on the high-tech
   practice of double-grafted, leaf blight resistant and high-yielding
   rubber clones on the one hand, and the low-tech practice of extractive
   use of natural rubber stands on the other. The intermediate, traditional
   practice of enriching slash-and-burn plots with rubber trees and
   managing them in a. secondary forest environment, in association with
   other timber and non-timber species, has largely been overlooked. We
   present results from a survey of 51 farmer families conducted on the
   eastern bank of the Tapajos river in the central Brazilian Amazon,
   focusing on the population zone of the Tapajos National Forest and its
   northern vicinity. Actively managed rubber agroforests were most common
   on the sandy river banks and on humus- and clay-rich and ferralitic
   soils near the edge of the plateau at a few kilometers from the river.
   There was a gradient in management intensity between the proximity of
   the villages at the river, where rubber was often a component of
   homegardens, and the distant groves on the plateau, which often
   resembled secondary forests. The spatial separation of access to water
   at the river and more fertile soils on the plateau, the historical
   practice of abandoning the rubber groves at times of low rubber prices,
   and a substantial risk of losing plantations to abiotic and biotic
   threats, especially fire, are identified as factors that have presumably
   favored the development of agroforests with low management intensity in
   the region. Although about half of the interviewed farmers expressed a
   preference for weeded plantations, almost 90\% of them extracted vegetal
   products other than rubber from the agroforests or used them as hunting
   grounds, and 80\% believed that associated vegetation had no negative
   influence on rubber yields. The often good health of old rubber trees in
   Amazonian agroforests is explained with lower pressure from root rots,
   the periodic abandonment and especially a tapping technique that is well
   adapted to a moist forest environment. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

Abstract = {This work aimed to assess the effect of spacing, arrangement and
   ecological group composition of planted seedlings on the restoration
   process of artificial reservoir shores in southeastern Brazil. The
   assessments were performed 12 years after the settlement of the
   experiment in which five mixed stand models were tested. First, a
   general evaluation of the stand was performed when we surveyed the
   overstory and understory, seed bank and soil for chemical analysis.
   Then, the restoration indicators survival of planted trees, basal area
   and density of the tree community, litter accumulated on the soil and
   canopy closure index were utilized to compare the plantation models and
   to assess the influence the experimental factors on these parameters. In
   the general analysis, we found that the studied stand presents low
   diversity, poor regeneration, and seed bank dominated mostly by one
   planted exotic tree species and weeds, which may jeopardize the
   self-maintenance of the stand in the future. The factor that most
   influenced the models was the ecological group composition with the best
   performance found for models in which both pioneer and non-pioneer
   groups were used. Probably, the plantation arrangement and spacing did
   not have greater influence due to both plant mortality and natural
   regeneration that has developed to this age. Hence, it is not
   recommended the use of only pioneer species in the implantation of
   riparian forest and the proportion of 50\% pioneers and 50\%
   non-pioneers using as much species as possible is indicated for areas
   that might present constraints for the natural regeneration.},

Journal = {FOLIA PRIMATOLOGICA},

Pages = {295-308},
Abstract = {This study examines how habitat structure affects the home range use of
   a group of Brachyteles hypoxanthus in the Brigadeiro State Park, Brazil.
   It has been reported that most of the annual feeding time of woolly
   spider monkeys is spent eating leaves, but they prefer fruits when
   available. We hypothesise that the protein-to-fibre ratio (PF; best
   descriptor of habitat quality for folivorous primates) is a better
   descriptor of habitat quality and abundance for these primates than the
   structural attributes of forests (basal area is the best descriptor of
   habitat quality for frugivorous primates of Africa and Asia). We
   evaluated plant community structure, successional status, and PF of leaf
   samples from the dominant tree populations, both within the core and
   from a non-core area of the home range of our study group. Forest
   structure was a combination of stem density and basal area of dominant
   tree populations. The core area had larger trees, a higher forest basal
   area, and higher stem density than the non-core area. Mean PF did not
   differ significantly between these sites, although PF was influenced by
   differences in tree regeneration guilds. Large-bodied monkeys could be
   favoured by later successional stages of forests because larger trees
   and denser stems prevent the need for a higher expenditure of energy for
   locomotion as a consequence of vertical travel when the crowns of trees
   are disconnected in early successional forests. Forest structure
   variables (such as basal area of trees) driven by succession influence
   woolly spider monkey abundance in a fashion similar to frugivorous
   monkeys of Asia and Africa, and could explain marked differences in
   ranging behaviour and home range use by B. hypoxanthus. Copyright (C)

   interviewed active harvesters in four communities in which A. speciosa
   use has been documented. Historical documents were evaluated as a
   complement to the interview data. According to local informants, areas
   previously used for cultivation and animal husbandry that were abandoned
   or decimated by droughts in the region may have fostered the expansion
   of a monodominant A. speciosa forest. Furthermore, other forms of

   destined to the creation of cattle for over 20 years and the other
   without activities for 10 years. Thus, 40 lots of 25 x 10 m (250 m2)
   were installed at those areas, in which individuals were sampled
   according to their family, genus and species, and phytosociological
   parameters were analysed. The evaluated indicators were: natural

   areas presented similar patterns, regarding phytosociology and
   diversity, where Poincianella bracteosa, Mimosa tenuiflora and
   Aspidosperma pyrifolium are the main species. As for the ecological
   indicators, the natural regeneration and Entomofauna both presented
   similar results for the areas, while the leaf litter presented a
   significant difference between the areas, indicating a higher value for
   the preserved environment. However, the areas showed similar patterns,

Abstract = {World conservation discourse concentrates on forests of high
   naturalness, which are variously termed intact forest landscapes,
   primary forests, pristine forests, and wilderness. In this essay, we
   bring Amazonian Indigenous perspectives to this discussion, both because
   Amazonian Indigenous Peoples have the right to be in the discussion and
   because they have a lot to teach us about naturalness. It is essential
   to understand that Indigenous ontologies do not distinguish culture from
   nature, since all beings, humans and non-humans, are part of a network
   of social-ecological interactions. Hence, forests are not natural, but
   the domus of different beings who inhabit, care for and cultivate them.
   Each part of the forest mosaic in different stages of social-ecological
   succession has different owners: when people open swiddens, they must
   respect other - non-human - forest residents to do so, and when they
   fallow their swiddens, these other forest residents reassume their
   original roles as managers and conservers of that part of the mosaic.
   Each stage of the succession also contains cultivated and domesticated
   plant populations, so we can think of a different kind of conservation:
   that of genetic resources. From this perspective, swidden-fallow
   represents on farm conservation, while less anthropogenic parts of the
   forest mosaic represent in situ conservation. We believe that reframing
   forest conservation and learning from Indigenous People can inspire

Title = {Breeding Guild Determines Frog Distributions in Response to Edge Effects
   and Habitat Conversion in the Brazil's Atlantic Forest},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {11},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN 7},
Abstract = {Understanding the response of species with differing life-history traits
   to habitat edges and habitat conversion helps predict their likelihood
   of persistence across changing landscape. In Brazil's Atlantic Forest,
   we evaluated frog richness and abundance by breeding guild at four
   distances from the edge of a reserve: i) 200 m inside the forest, ii) 50
   m inside the forest, iii) at the forest edge, and iv) 50 m inside three
   different converted habitats (coffee plantation, non-native Eucalyptus
   plantation, and abandoned pastures, hereafter matrix types). By sampling
   a dry and a wet season, we recorded 622 individual frogs representing 29
   species, of which three were undescribed. Breeding guild (i.e.
   bromeliad, leaf-litter, and water-body breeders) was the most important
   variable explaining frog distributions in relation to edge effects and
   matrix types. Leaf-litter and bromeliad breeders decreased in richness
   and abundance from the forest interior toward the matrix habitats.
   Water-body breeders increased in richness toward the matrix and remained
   relatively stable in abundance across distances. Number of large trees
   (i.e. DBH > 15 cm) and bromeliads best explained frog richness and
   abundance across distances. Twenty species found in the interior of the
   forest were not found in any matrix habitat. Richness and abundance
   across breeding guilds were higher in the rainy season but frog
   distributions were similar across the four distances in the two seasons.
   Across matrix types, leaf-litter species primarily used Eucalyptus
   plantations, whereas water-body species primarily used coffee
   plantations. Bromeliad breeders were not found inside any matrix
   habitat. Our study highlights the importance of primary forest for
   bromeliad and leaf-litter breeders. We propose that water-body breeders
   use edge and matrix habitats to reach breeding habitats along the
   valleys. Including life-history characteristics, such as breeding guild,
   can improve predictions of frog distributions in response to edge effect
   and matrix types, and can guide more effective management and
   conservation actions.},

Abstract = {The objective of this study was to evaluate the edge effect on arboreal
   component of two Atlantic Forest fragments, in the Watershed of Tapacura
   River, Pernambuco. For the sampling of the adult component 15 plots of
   10 x 25 m were plotted and subplots of 1 x 25 m for the regeneration.
   The plots were arranged in three environments, with five sampling units
   each, according to distance from the edge. Comparisons between the
   environments were performed by specie composition, Venn diagram and
   cluster analysis. The greatest richness was observed in the area farther
   from the edge and the greatest number of individuals near the edge. In
   the Mata da Onca, the farthest edge environments were similar, but
   different in composition and structure as compared to the nearest
   environment. However, in the Mata da Buchada the first two environments
   near to the edge were similar. The interaction between the human
   environment and the fragment affects the arboreal community in the
   fragment edges.},

Abstract = {The most important condition of ecological restoration is the
   identification of reference ecosystems, which function as a guide for
   assertive practice with which biological integrity and ecosystem
   structure and function can be compared. For restoration and conservation
   projects to be effective in the current scenario of biodiversity and
   ecosystem services decay worldwide, it is fundamental to understand the
   soil -plant interactions in each environment. In this study, we
   evaluated the structure and composition of the flora in 45 plots,
   equally distributed in three preserved areas (reference ecosystems) of
   Atlantic Forest in the upper Rio Doce watershed, Southeast Brazil. We
   also tested whether differences in species composition were influenced
   by edaphic factors, both in the adult tree and sapling strata. In both
   tree and sapling strata, Fabaceae was the species -richest family,
   followed by Myrtaceae, and Lauraceae. The Fabaceae family also showed
   the highest importance value for both strata. The soils of the riparian
   forests were highly heterogeneous among the studied sites. Co -inertia
   analyses indicated a clear edaphic-floristic gradient in both tree (RV =
   0.467; p < 0.001) and sapling (RV = 0.478; p < 0.001) strata, with a
   connection of 46.7\% and 47.8\% between the edaphic and floristic
   matrices for trees and saplings, respectively. We identified the groups
   of tree and sapling strata species that were strongly associated with
   either nutritionally richer or poorer soils on each studied site.
   Understanding how ecological and life -history traits of plant species
   relate with edaphic factors is an important step to provide scientific
   -based knowledge to support policies for ecosystem recovery and
   restoration in the stretches of the Rio Doce watershed.},

Volume = {61},

Abstract = {The majority of the ants is opportunistic and generalist foragers,
   commonly feeding on vegetable secretions, seeds, and living or dead
   animal material. They may be present on any type of substrate even,
   occasionally on carcasses. This work, then, aimed to evaluate the action
   of insects, especially ants, in the exploitation of protein resources in
   forest environment. Monthly collections were made over a year and, in
   each collection, were made observations during 12 consecutive hours. To
   simulate exposure of protein resources we used three types of baits,
   sardines, beef liver and chicken. To evaluate the importance of ants on
   protein resources for each type of bait there was a control replica with
   physical barrier to prevent their access. The ants were observed on all
   baits throughout the collection period. In total, the baits were visited
   by 34 species of ants. The main genus of ants to visit the baits were:
   Pheidole, Crematogaster and Solenopsis. These results demonstrate that
   the presence of ants is important to ecological succession on temporary
   protein sources in forest environments interfering in the occurrence of
   other frequent groups in this type of resource, such as flies, for
   instance. The species that dominated the baits, when presents, were
   those that regardless of size and aggressiveness, presented mass
   recruitment and exploited the baits with large flow of individuals
   Although some species that exhibit certain characteristics can locate
   the baits faster and eventually dominate them at some point, depending
   on the ants species that co-occur, the results for the sequence of
   colonization can be modified.},

Abstract = {Current rates of deforestation and the resulting C emissions in the
   tropics exceed those of secondary forest regrowth and C sequestration.
   Changing land-use strategies that would maintain standing forests may be
   among the least expensive of climate change mitigation options. Further,
   secondary tropical forests have been suggested to have great value for
   their potential to sequester atmospheric C. These options require an
   understanding of and capability to quantify C dynamics at landscape
   scales. Because of the diversity of physical and biotic features of
   tropical forests as well as approaches and intensities of land uses
   within the neotropics, there are tremendous differences in the capacity
   of different landscapes to store and sequester C. Major gaps in our
   current knowledge include quanti. cation of C pools, rates and patterns
   of biomass loss following land-cover change, and quanti. cation of the C
   storage potential of secondary forests following abandonment. In this
   paper we present a synthesis and further analyses from recent studies
   that describe C pools, patterns of C decline associated with land use,
   and rates of C accumulation following secondary-forest establishment-all
   information necessary for climate-change mitigation options.
   Ecosystem C pools of Neotropical primary forests minimally range from
   similar to 141 to 571 Mg/ha, demonstrating tremendous differences in the
   capacity of different forests to store C. Most of the losses in C and
   nutrient pools associated with conversion occur when. res are set to
   remove the slashed forest to prepare sites for crop or pasture
   establishment. Fires burning slashed primary forests have been found to
   result in C losses of 62-80\% of prefire aboveground pools in dry
   (deciduous) forest landscapes and 29-57\% in wet (evergreen) forest
   landscapes. Carbon emissions equivalent to the aboveground
   primary-forest pool arise from repeated. res occurring in the first 4 to
   10 years following conversion. Feedbacks of climate change, land-cover
   change, and increasing habitat fragmentation may result in increases of
   both the area burned and the total quantity of biomass consumed per unit
   area by. re. These effects may well limit the capacity for future
   tropical forests to sequester C and nutrients.},
